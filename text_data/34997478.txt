Introduction:Helicobacter pylori has been implicated in the etiopathogenesis of various malignant conditions; however, there is a dearth of studies on the correlation between H. pylori infection and pancreatic cancers. Hence, this study was carried out to evaluate the association between H. pylori infection and periampullary and pancreatic cancer.Methods:This was a single-centre, retrospective, case-control study in which all consecutive patients of periampullary or pancreatic cancer were included. The demographic details with tumour characteristics were recorded. Age and gender-matched controls were patients with other extra-abdominal benign conditions. H. pylori and the Cag A status were determined using IgG antibodies and Cag A antibodies respectively. The association between H. pylori infection and periampullary and pancreatic cancer was the primary outcome.Results:A total of 155 patients, 61 in the study and 94 in the control group were included. The overall prevalence of H. pylori in the study group (78.6%) was similar to that of the control group (76.5%) (p = 0.76). Although a higher trend of IgG and Cag A seropositivity was seen in the study group, the difference was not significant. The correlation of H. pylori and Cag A seropositivity showed a higher trend with site-specificity, differentiation, and nodal status. However, the difference was not significant.Conclusion:There was no association between H. pylori infection and Cag A seropositivity with periampullary and pancreatic cancers. The various tumour characteristics were also not associated with H. pylori infection. Thus, routine eradication of H. pylori infection may not be recommended in periampullary and pancreatic cancers.
