Three recent advances in the surgical approach to pancreatic cancer over the past decade have improved both short- and long-term outcomes for patients with nonmetastatic, operable pancreatic cancer. These include (1) minimally invasive pancreatectomy to reduce operative morbidity while adhering to principles of open oncologic resections, (2) neoadjuvant chemotherapy to treat radiographically occult metastatic disease and improve locoregional control, and (3) applying irreversible electroporation as an adjunct to surgery, allowing a fraction of locally advanced pancreatic cancer to be resected.
