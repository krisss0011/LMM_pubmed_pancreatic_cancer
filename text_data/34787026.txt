We present the case of a 78-year-old African American man with a history of human immunodeficiency virus diagnosed in 2007 who was newly diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was placed during the initial inpatient visit of pancreatic cancer diagnosis due to persistent dysphagia. Due to PEG placement and the patient's wish to continue his previous antiretroviral therapy, the patient crushed his fixed-dose bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide under the direction of a physician and has maintained virologic suppression.
