Tumor-specific targeting with fluorescent probes can enhance contrast for identification of cancer during surgical resection and visualize otherwise invisible tumor margins. Nanobodies are the smallest naturally-occurring antigen-binding molecules with rapid pharmacokinetics. The present work demonstrates the efficacy of a fluorescent anti-CEA nanobody conjugated to an IR800 dye to target and label patient derived pancreatic cancer xenografts. After intravenous administration, the probe rapidly localized to the pancreatic cancer tumors within an hour and had a tumor-to-background ratio of 2.0 by 3 h. The fluorescence signal was durable over a prolonged period of time. With the rapid kinetics afforded by fluorescent nanobodies, both targeting and imaging can be performed on the same day as surgery.
