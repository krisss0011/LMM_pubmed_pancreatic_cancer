Objectives:This study aims to assess the prevalence of preoperative fatigue, depression and anxiety among patients undergoing pancreatic surgery for pancreatic cancer (PC), and possible relationship with postoperative outcomes.Methods:Prospective data from 162 consecutive patients undergoing pancreatectomy for PC at a third-level referral centers for pancreatic surgery were collected. All patients preoperatively completed four questionnaires assessing depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (STAI-Y2), chronic illness fatigue (FACIT-F) and cancer therapy fatigue (FACT-G).Results:Forty patients (25%) where in the first quartile for chronic illness (FACIT-F ≤34) and/or cancer therapy (FACT-G ≤78) fatigue, 26 patients (16%) met the criteria for major depression (PHQ-9 ≥10) and 34 patients (21%) had anxiety symptoms (STAI-Y2 ≥40). Cancer therapy fatigue was significantly associated with higher rates of morbidity (70% vs 49%), major morbidity (Clavien-Dindo ≥3) (28% vs 11%), post-pancreatectomy hemorrhage (18% vs 4%), pulmonary complications (20% vs 9%) and mortality (8% vs null) (all P ≤ 0.01). Major depression was associated with higher rates of post-pancreatectomy hemorrhage and readmission (23% vs 5%). Multivariable logistic regression analysis of preoperative factors confirmed diabetes (OR 2.71, 95%CI 1.01-7.20; P = 0.04), ASA score ≥3 (OR 4.12, 95%CI 1.52-11.21; P < 0.01) and cancer therapy fatigue (OR 2.95, 95%CI 1.01-8.74; P = 0.04) to be independent predictors of major morbidity.Conclusions:Higher levels of fatigue (in particular cancer therapy fatigue) strongly correlates with worse postoperative outcomes.
