Pancreatic cancer (PC) is an aggressive malignant tumor with low rate of 
surgical resection and poor prognosis. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a 
cytokine that has both protumor and antitumor activities, depending on tumor 
microenvironment. The interaction between TGF-β signaling and the tumor 
microenvironment in PC is complex. Here, we reviewed the role of TGF-β in the 
tumor microenvironment of PC, highlighting producers of TGF-β and TGF-β 
responders in the tumor microenvironment of PC.
