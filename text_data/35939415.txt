BACKGROUND Synchronous malignancies are primary cancers that are diagnosed in a single individual within a 2-month period. Synchronous malignancies are uncommon, involving only 2.4-8% of all cancer cases, with a very low number of cases of simultaneous gastric and pancreatic cancer. Although cases of synchronous malignancies do exist, synchronous pancreatic adenocarcinoma and signet ring cell (SRC) gastric adenocarcinoma have not been documented. CASE REPORT A 76-year-old woman with a previously diagnosed intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) presented with left-sided abdominal pain. Initial workup, including computed tomography imaging and endoscopic ultrasound with biopsy, led to the diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Within 1 month of diagnosis, the patient underwent an extended Whipple procedure and was also found to have a primary SRC gastric adenocarcinoma on evaluation of the gastric tissue margins that were removed during the procedure. The patient was initiated on chemoradiation therapy with 5-fluorouracil. However, following a subsequent decline in performance status and multiple hospitalizations, she could not tolerate further cancer treatment and died soon afterwards. CONCLUSIONS Few cases of synchronous malignancies involving the stomach and pancreas have been reported. Because gastric cancer could easily be missed on screening endoscopy; physicians must have a high index of suspicion. In those patients with a prior history of cancer, biopsies should be performed to aid in early diagnosis. To our knowledge, only metachronous cases of SRC gastric and pancreatic adenocarcinoma have been documented. Therefore, this report represents the first case of synchronous SRC gastric adenocarcinoma and IPMN-associated pancreatic adenocarcinoma in the literature.
