Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are key players in the innate immune system. Recent studies have suggested that they may affect the growth of pancreatic cancer, a disease with no cure. Among them, TLR7 shows promise for therapy but may also promotes tumor growth. Thus, we aimed to clarify the therapeutic potential of TLR7 ligands in experimental pancreatic cancer models, to open the door for clinical applications. In vitro, we found that TLR7 ligands strongly inhibit the proliferation of both human and murine pancreatic cancer cells, compared with TLR2 agonists. Hence, TLR7 treatment alters cancer cells' cell cycle and induces cell death by apoptosis. In vivo, TLR7 agonist therapy significantly delays the growth of murine pancreatic tumors engrafted in immunodeficient mice. Remarkably, TLR7 ligands administration instead increases tumor growth and accelerates animal death when tumors are engrafted in immunocompetent models. Further investigations revealed that TLR7 agonists modulate the intratumoral content and phenotype of macrophages and that depleting such tumor-associated macrophages strongly hampers TLR7 agonist-induced tumor growth. Collectively, our findings shine a light on the duality of action of TLR7 agonists in experimental cancer models and call into question their use for pancreatic cancer therapy.
