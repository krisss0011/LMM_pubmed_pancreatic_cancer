Background:Duodenal adenocarcinoma (DA) is a rare gastrointestinal malignancy. There is limited data reporting patient outcomes following radical pancreatic resection for DA. We assessed the disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy for DA in our institution.Methods:We retrospectively analysed all patients undergoing pancreatic resection of DA at our institution between January 2009 and March 2020 inclusive.Results:Ninteen patients underwent pancreatic resection at our institution for DA during the study period. The overall postoperative morbidity and mortality was 37% and 5%, respectively. Nine patients (47%) had no nodal involvement. Median follow up was 25 months (range 1-108 months). Median DFS for our whole cohort was 17 months but was significantly higher in patients with no nodal metastasis [p < 0.001]. Median OS was 9.5 months for the whole cohort but was significantly higher in the patients with no nodal metastasis (60 months) compared to those with nodal metastasis (17.5 months) [p < 0.003].Conclusion:Improved DFS and OS for patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy for DAs is associated with lymph node negative disease.
