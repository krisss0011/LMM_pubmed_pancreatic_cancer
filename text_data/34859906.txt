Among digestive system cancers, the extremely poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer (PC) is a pressing concern. Nonoperative treatments such as targeted and immunotherapy, have improved the current situation, however, the accompanying side effects of these chemicals should not be ignored. Here, we discovered a novel hydroxycinnamic acid named sinapic acid (SA) derived from fruits, vegetables, cereals, and oil crops as an effective anti-PC molecule. Both the in vitro and in vivo models we designed showed that SA exhibited anticancer activities but not apoptosis induction. Research on the underlying mechanisms illustrated that AKT phosphorylation was blocked by SA, and the downstream Gsk-3Î² was downregulated subsequently. Our study revealed the inhibitory activity and underlying mechanisms of SA, providing evidence that SA is a potential strategy for cancer research and can be a promising option of PC chemotherapy.
