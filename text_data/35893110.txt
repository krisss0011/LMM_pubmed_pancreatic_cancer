Background and Objectives:Pancreatic cystic lesions (PCLs) are frequently incidental findings. The prevalence of PCLs is increasing, mainly due to advancements in imaging techniques, but also because of the aging of the population. PCLs comprise challenging clinical problems, as their manifestations vary from benign to malignant lesions. Therefore, the recognition of PCLs is achieved through a complex diagnostic and surveillance process, which in turn is usually long-term, invasive, and expensive. Despite the progress made in the identification of novel biomarkers in the cystic fluid that also support the differentiation of PCLs, their application in clinical practice is limited.Materials and Methods:We conducted a systematic review of the literature published in two databases, Pubmed and Embase, on biochemical biomarkers in PCLs that may be applied in the diagnostic algorithms of PCLs.Results:Eleven studies on intracystic glucose, twenty studies on intracystic carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and eighteen studies on other biomarkers were identified. Low levels of intracystic glucose had high sensitivity and specificity in the differentiation between mucinous and non-mucinous cystic neoplasms.Conclusions:CEA and glucose are the most widely studied fluid biochemical markers in pancreatic cystic lesions. Glucose has better diagnostic accuracy than CEA. Other biochemical biomarkers require further research.
