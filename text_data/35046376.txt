A 71-year-old man complained of abdominal pain. He showed fecal occult blood positive and he was referred to our hospital for further examination and treatment. During examinations, he developed colonic obstruction. As a result of examinations, he was diagnosed with pancreatic tail cancer invading to the colon. We underwent distal pancreatectomy, partial colectomy, partial gastrectomy, and left adrenalectomy. Although chylous fistula was observed, he was discharged from hospital 35 days after surgery. He has received adjuvant chemotherapy using S-1, and no recurrence has been observed 4 months after operation.
