Background & aims:High mortality rate of pancreatic cancer (PC) as one of the most common cancers worldwide made it a center of attention for recent researches on its pathology, etiology, screening and early diagnosis. In previous researches, association of dietary intake and plasma levels of fatty acids with risk of pancreatic cancer was investigated. In this study we aimed to evaluate the correlation between dietary and plasma fatty acids in case and control groups.Methods:From 50,045 adults between 40-75 years old participated in Golestan cohort study, fifty incident cases of PC were diagnosed and 150 controls matched by age, sex and residence place were randomly selected. Dietary intakes and plasma levels of fatty acids was evaluated by validated food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and Gas Chromatography - Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID), respectively. Then, Spearman's correlation was used to measure the correlation between dietary and plasma levels of fatty acids in case and control groups.Results:Among all the fatty acids, there was a significant association between plasma and dietary intake of a few fatty acids including trans fatty acids (TFA), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), 22:6n-3 and 14:0 only in control group. Only total PUFA intake modified plasma level of some fatty acids in case group. There was no difference between association of desaturase enzymes and fatty acids in case and controls.Conclusions:Since, plasma levels of fatty acids might be influenced by recent diet, we did not find any specific differences between the associations of plasma levels of fatty acids with dietary intake of fats in case and control groups.
