Purpose:Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a component of familial melanoma due to germline pathogenic variants (GPVs) inCDKN2A. However, it is unclear what role this gene or other genes play in its etiology.Materials and methods:We analyzed 189 cancer predisposition genes using parametric rare-variant association (RVA) tests and nonparametric permutation tests to identify gene-level associations in PDAC for patients with (CDKN2A+) and without (CDKN2A-) GPV. Exome sequencing was performed on 84 patients with PDAC, 47CDKN2A+and 37CDKN2A-. After variant filtering, various RVA tests and permutation tests were run separately byCDKN2Astatus. Genes with the strongest nominal associations were evaluated in patients with PDAC from The Cancer Genome Atlas and the UK Biobank (UKB). A secondary analysis including only GPV from UKB was also performed.Results:In RVA tests,ERCC4andRETshowed the most compelling evidence as plausible PDAC candidate genes forCDKN2A+patients. In contrast, the findings inCDKN2A-patients provided evidence forHMBS,EPCAM, andMRE11as potential new candidate genes and confirmedATM, BRCA2, andPALB2as PDAC genes, consistent with findings in The Cancer Genome Atlas and the UKB. As expected,CDKN2A-patients were more likely to harbor GPVs from the 189 genes investigated. When including only GPVs from UKB, significant associations with PDAC were seen for ATM, BRCA2, andCDKN2A.Conclusion:These results suggest that variants in other genes likely play a role in PDAC in all patients and that PDAC inCDKN2A+patients has a distinct etiology from PDAC inCDKN2A-patients.
