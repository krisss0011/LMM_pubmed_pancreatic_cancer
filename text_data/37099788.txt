Objectives:RING finger protein 26 (RNF26) plays an essential role in determining malignant tumor growth, whereas the role of which in pancreatic cancer (PC) has not been reported. This study aimed to investigate the role of RNF26 in PC cells.Methods:The Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis was applied to study the role of RNF26 in malignant tumors. The in vitro or in vivo cell proliferation assays were used to investigate the role of RNF26 on the PC. The protein-protein interaction network analysis was used to search the binding partner of RNF26. The Western blot was used to reveal whether RNF26 promoted RNA binding motif protein-38 (RBM38) degradation in PC cells.Results:The Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis tool showed that RNF26 was overexpressed in PC. Repressing RNF26 expression decreased PC cells growth, but overexpression of RNF26 increased PC proliferation. Furthermore, we demonstrated RNF26 degraded RBM38 to promote PC cell proliferation.Conclusions:RNF26 was abnormally increased in PC, and upregulated RNF26 was correlated with a poor prognosis. RNF26 enhanced PC proliferation by inducing RBM38 degradation. We identified a novel RNF26-RBM28 axis involved in the progression of PC.
