Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is highly lethal and resistant to conventional therapies, including chemo-, radio-, and immunotherapy. In this study, it is first determined that a combination of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) and RSL-3 (a glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) inhibitor) markedly induced ferroptosis of PDAC tumor cells. A mechanistic study revealed that DHA can react with iron ions to generate carbon radicals and deplete intracellular glutathione, thereby cumulatively triggering the lipid peroxidation of tumor cells with RSL-3-mediated GPX4 inhibition. A DHA-conjugated amphiphilic copolymer is subsequently synthesized, and intracellular acidity and oxidation dual-responsive DHA nanoparticles are further engineered for the tumor-specific co-delivery of DHA and RSL-3. The resultant nanoparticles (PDBA@RSL-3) efficiently induce ferroptosis of tumor cells in the Panc02 tumor-bearing immune-deficient mouse model, and elicit T-cell-based antitumor immunity in the immune-competent mouse model. The combination of PDBA@RSL-3 nanoparticles and programmed death ligand 1 blockade therapy efficiently inhibits PDAC tumor growth in the immune-competent mouse models. This study may provide novel insights for treatment of PDAC with ferroptosis-based immunotherapy.
