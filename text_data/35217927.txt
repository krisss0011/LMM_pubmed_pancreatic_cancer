Introduction:Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) is one of the major critical complications after pancreatic resection. Recently, postoperative acute pancreatitis (POAP), a new concept for a pancreatic-specific complication following pancreatic resection, has been advocated, and its association with POPF has been reported. The present study examined the clinical features of POAP and identified the associations of POAP with POPF and other postoperative morbidities in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients undergoing pancreatic resection.Methods:A total of 312 consecutive patients who underwent pancreatic resection for PDAC at our institution from 2013 to 2019 were enrolled in this study. POAP was defined as an elevated serum amylase level above the upper limit normal on postoperative day (POD) 0 or 1, based on Connor's definition. The severity of POPF was assessed by the International Study Group on Pancreatic Surgery definition.Results:A total of 184 patients (58.9%) had POAP. POAP occurred in 58.5% of subtotal stomach-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy patients and 60% of distal pancreatectomy combined with splenectomy patients. The presence of POAP was significantly associated with the development of clinically relevant POPF, higher rates of severe morbidity, and a prolonged hospital stay after pancreatic resection. A multivariate analysis showed that the presence of POAP and elevated C-reactive protein levels on POD 3 were independent predictors of clinically relevant POPF after subtotal stomach-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy.Conclusions:POAP is associated with the development of POPF, higher rates of severe morbidity, and a prolonged hospital stay after pancreatic resection and is an independent risk factor for clinically relevant POPF after pancreatoduodenectomy. POAP represents an important indicator for planning treatment strategies to prevent serious complications, including POPF.
