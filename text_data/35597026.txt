Background:Many extracts and purified alkaloids of M. cordata (Papaveraceae family) have been reported to display promising anti-tumor effects by inhibiting cancer cell growth and inducing apoptosis in many cancer types. However, no evidence currently exists for anti-pancreatic cancer activity of alkaloids extracted from M. cordata, including a novel alkaloid named 6â€‘methoxy dihydrosphingosine (6-Methoxydihydroavicine, 6-ME) derived from M. cordata fruits.Purpose:The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-tumor effects of 6-ME on PC cells and the underlying mechanism.Methods:CCK-8, RTCA, and colony-formation assays were used to analyze PC cell growth. Cell death ratios, changes in MMP and ROS levels were measured by flow cytometry within corresponding detection kits. A Seahorse XFe96 was employed to examine the effects of 6-ME on cellular bioenergetics. Western blot and q-RT-PCR were conducted to detect changes in target molecules.Results:6-ME effectively reduced the growth of PC cells and promoted PCD by activating RIPK1, caspases, and GSDME. Specifically, 6-ME treatment caused a disruption of OAA metabolism and increased ROS production, thereby affecting mitochondrial homeostasis and reducing aerobic glycolysis. These responses resulted in mitophagy and RIPK1-mediated cell death.Conclusion:6-ME exhibited specific anti-tumor effects through interrupting OAA metabolic homeostasis to trigger ROS/RIPK1-dependent cell death and mitochondrial dysfunction, suggesting that 6-ME could be considered as a highly promising compound for PC intervention.
