Background:Anatomical variations in the liver arterial supply are quite common and can affect the surgical strategy when performing a minimally invasive pancreaticoduodenectomy (MIPD). Their presence must be preemptively detected to avoid postoperative liver and biliary complications.Data sources:Following the PRISMA guidelines and the Cochrane protocol we conducted a systematic review on the management of an accessory or replaced right hepatic artery (RHA) arising from the superior mesenteric artery when performing an MIPD.Results:Five studies involving 118 patients were included. The most common reported management of the aberrant RHA was conservative (97.0%); however, patients undergoing aberrant RHA division without reconstruction did not develop liver or biliary complications. No differences in postoperative morbidity or long-term oncological related overall survival were reported in all the included studies when comparing MIPD in patients with standard anatomy to those with aberrant RHA.Conclusions:MIPD in patients with aberrant RHA is feasible without increase in morbidity and mortality. As preoperative strategy is crucial, we suggested planning an MIPD with an anomalous RHA focusing on preoperative vascular aberrancy assessment and different strategies to reduce the risk of liver ischemia.
