Objectives:Measurement of the macroscopic visible core (MVC) length during macroscopic on-site quality evaluation (MOSE) may allow estimation of sample adequacy for next-generation sequencing (NGS), and prediction of correct diagnosis in endoscopic ultrasound-guided tissue acquisition (EUS-TA) of pancreatic masses.Methods:This multicenter prospective study included consecutive patients who underwent EUS-TA for pancreatic masses using a 22-G Franseen needle. MVC length and pathological samples obtained from two needle passes were analyzed on a per-pass basis. Outcome measures included respective correlations of MVC length with histological sample quantity and diagnostic yields.Results:The analysis included 204 passes from 102 EUS-TAs. MVC length correlated positively with histological sample quantity (P < 0.01). On the receiver operating characteristic curve for MVC length, the cut-off value and area under the curve for obtaining a candidate sample for NGS were 30 mm and 0.74 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65-0.83), respectively. On multivariate analysis, MVC length â‰¥30 mm was a significant factor affecting suitability for NGS (odds ratio 6.19; 95% CI 2.72-14.10). Histologic diagnostic yield correlated positively with MVC length (P = 0.01); however, there was no positive correlation between MVC length and overall (histology plus cytology) diagnostic yield.Conclusions:Measuring MVC length to predict histological sample quantity on MOSE may be of clinical significance during EUS-TA using a 22-G Franseen needle. It may be an effective method, particularly while submitting samples for NGS.Registration:University Hospital Medical Information Network Trials Registry (UMIN000036528).
