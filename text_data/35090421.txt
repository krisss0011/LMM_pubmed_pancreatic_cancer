Background:Sodium glucose transporters (SGLTs) play vital roles in glucose uptake in many solid cancers, including pancreatic cancer (PC). However, their expression profile in pancreatic cancer and correlation with prognosis are not clear. Thus, we aimed to analyse the expression profile and prognostic significance of SGLT-1 and SGLT-2 in PC.Methods:Eighty-eight patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) undergoing surgery in Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, from July 2017 to June 2020 were enrolled in the study. Specimens for immunohistochemistry were obtained through surgical resection. Bioinformatics analysis was performed based on the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), Oncomine and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases. The statistics were calculated using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 20 and R 4.1.1. P values lower than 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance.Results:SGLT-1 but not SGLT-2 was significantly overexpressed in PDAC. Survival analysis showed that the median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with high SGLT-1 expression were significantly longer than that of patients with low SGLT-1 expression. Cox regression indicated that high SGLT-1 expression was an independent predictor for a better prognosis, while residual tumour status (R1 and R2) was an independent risk factor for a poor prognosis. Finally, PDZK1-interacting protein 1 (PDZK1IP1), a protein participating in the generation of reactive oxygen species, was overexpressed in PDAC and its expression was significantly correlated with SGLT-1.Conclusions:SGLT-1 but not SGLT-2 was overexpressed in PDAC, and the overexpression of SGLT-1 could be a predictor of a better prognosis. Residual tumour status (R1 and R2) was a risk factor for poor prognosis and disease progression.
