Objective:The involvement of tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) in macrophage polarization has been reported. In our present study, we tried to discuss the regulatory role of LINC00511 encapsulated in pancreatic cancer (PCa) cell-derived EVs in the development and progression of PCa.Methods:EVs from PCa cell line BxPC-3 culture medium were collected and subsequently identified by electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis. The expression pattern of LINC00511 in PCa cell-derived EVs was determined. The interaction among LINC00511, microRNA-193a-3p, and plasminogen activator urokinase (PLAU) was explored. After co-culture of PCa cell-derived EVs with macrophages, the regulatory roles of LINC00511 in macrophage polarization, PCa cell functions, glucose consumption, lactate production, glycolysis, and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation were investigated.Results:PCa cell line BxPC-3 had highly expressed LINC00511 and LINC00511 could be internalized by macrophages. LINC00511 affected macrophage polarization through miR-193a-3p-dependent regulation of PLAU expression. Besides, EV-derived LINC00511 accelerated glycolysis and promoted mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation of PCa cells through macrophage polarization, thus inducing invasion and migration of PCa cells.Conclusion:LINC00511 encapsulated in PCa cell-derived EVs facilitates glycolysis of PCa cells through regulation of macrophage polarization in the tumor microenvironment.
