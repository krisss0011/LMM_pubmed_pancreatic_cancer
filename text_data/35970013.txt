Background:The prognostic and predictive value of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) in locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) has not yet been defined from prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs).Patients and methods:A total of 165 LAPC patients were treated within the NEOLAP RCT for 16 weeks with multiagent induction chemotherapy [ICT; either nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine alone or nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine followed by FOLFIRINOX (combination of fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin)] followed by surgical exploration of all patients without evidence of disease progression. CA 19-9 was determined at baseline and after ICT and correlated with overall survival (OS) and secondary R0 resection rate.Results:From the NEOLAP study population (N = 165) 133 patients (81%) were evaluable for CA 19-9 at baseline and 81/88 patients (92%) for post-ICT CA 19-9 response. Median OS (mOS) in the CA 19-9 cohort (n = 133) was 16.2 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 13.0-19.4] and R0 resection (n = 31; 23%) was associated with a significant survival benefit [40.8 months (95% CI 21.7-59.8)], while R1 resected patients (n = 14; 11%) had no survival benefit [14.0 (95% CI 11.7-16.3) months, hazard ratio (HR) 0.27; P = 0.001]. After ICT most patients showed a CA 19-9 response (median change from baseline: -82%; relative decrease ≥55%: 83%; absolute decrease to ≤50 U/ml: 43%). Robust CA 19-9 response (decrease to ≤50U/ml) was significantly associated with mOS [27.8 (95% CI 18.4-37.2) versus 16.5 (95% CI 11.7-21.2) months, HR 0.49; P = 0.013], whereas CA 19-9 baseline levels were not prognostic for OS. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that a robust CA 19-9 response was an independent predictive factor for R0 resection. Using a CA 19-9 decrease to ≤61 U/ml as optimal cut-off (by receiver operating characteristic analysis) yielded 72% sensitivity and 62% specificity for successful R0 resection, whereas CA 19-9 nonresponders (<20% decrease or increase) had no chance for successful R0 resection.Conclusions:CA 19-9 response after multiagent ICT provides relevant prognostic and predictive information and is useful in selecting LAPC patients for explorative surgery.Clinical trial number:ClinicalTrials.govNCT02125136; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02125136; EudraCT 2013-004796-12; https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2013-004796-12/results.
