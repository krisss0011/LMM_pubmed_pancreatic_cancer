PARP inhibitors are effective in different types of tumors such as ovarian, breast, prostate and pancreatic cancer. Many studies are in progress and may lead to prescription evolution. PARP inhibitors prescription is almost reserved to patients with a constitutional BRCA mutation or a somatic BRCA alteration or a tumor with a deficiency in homologous recombination. Nowadays, the diagnosis of homologous recombination deficit, HRD, is possible with the prescription of a myChoice CDx (Myriad) test. PARP inhibitors are studied in association with chemotherapy and targeted therapies but also with radiotherapy and with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Access to PARP inhibitors is challenged with the emergence of resistance mechanism. Various trials are now studying the possibility of reversing these resistance mechanisms.
