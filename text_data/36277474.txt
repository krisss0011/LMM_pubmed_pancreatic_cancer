Background:Exosomal miR-29b reportedly plays a role during cancer metastasis. However, its exact function and underlying mechanism during pancreatic cancer (PC) have not been investigated.Methods:Exosomes from PC cells were prepared and identified. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and confocal microscopy were used to examine structural characteristics of the exosomes and verify their internalization by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The tube formation and migration abilities of HUVECs were detected. VEGF content was assessed by ELISA. GW4869 was used to suppress exosome release. Luciferase reporter assays were performed to verify the predicted interaction of miR-29b with ROBO1 and SRGAP2 mRNA.Results:Exosomal miRNA-29b was differentially expressed in the conditioned medium of PC cells. Exosomes from PC cells were verified by TEM and western blotting. Treatment with the exosomal inhibitor (GW4869) prevented an increase in miR-29b expression and recused the reduced VEGF expression and tube formation and migration abilities of HUVECs cocultured with BxPC3 and AsPC-1 cells that overexpressed miR-29b. Furthermore, the downregulation of ROBO1 and SRGAP2 in cocultured HUVECs was also reduced after additional treatment with GW4869. After incubation with miR-29b exosomes, HUVECs had lower VEGF concentrations and reduced migration and tube formation rates; however, those effects were eliminated by subsequent transfection with the miR-29b inhibitor. Luciferase reporter assays verified the interaction of miR-29b with ROBO1 and SRGAP2. That interaction was also supported by rescue assays showing that overexpression of ROBO1 and SRGAP2 also reduced the antiangiogenic effect of exosomal miR-29b in HUVECs.Conclusion:Exosomal miR-29b originating from PC cells protected HUVECs from PC cell-induced angiogenesis by attenuating ROBO1 and SRGAP2 expression. Our findings suggest a strategy for treating PC.
