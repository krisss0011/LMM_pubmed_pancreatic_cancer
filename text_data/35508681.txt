Background:While it has been shown that neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) for pancreatic cancer (PDAC) undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is critical for optimal oncologic management, NCT is (A) not universally practiced and (B) the reasons ill-defined. This study investigates national rates, trends, and factors affecting NCT utilization.Patients and methods:Using the National Cancer Database, patients who underwent PD for PDAC between 2006 and 2017 were identified. Changes in chemotherapy sequence over time were identified. For patients diagnosed after 2010, multivariable logistic regression models for factors affecting NCT were created.Results:A total of 128,980 patients were diagnosed and 23,206 underwent surgery. Three thousand five (12.9%) received NCT with a preoperative chemotherapy (NCT + PCT) utilization rate of 7.3% in 2004 that increased to 36.8% in 2017. Factors affecting utilization of preoperative chemotherapy were age (OR 0.972), academic and integrated network institutions (OR 1.916, OR 1.559), institutional case volume (OR 1.007), distance from the hospital (OR 1.002), stage (IB OR 3.108, IIA OR 3.133, IIB OR 3.775, III OR 3.782), grade IV (OR 1.977), and insurance status (private OR 2.371, Medicaid OR 1.811, and Medicare OR 2.191, government OR 2.645).Conclusion:Even though more than 3/5 of patients receive no preoperative chemotherapy (NCT + PCT) and nearly 1/5 of patients still receive no chemotherapy at all, utilization of NCT is increasing. Moreover, since this study demonstrates that omission of NCT is associated with modifiable factors such as type of institution and health care disparity, mechanisms (reimbursement, policy) geared to change current national practice patterns may most immediately affect optimal oncologic management.
