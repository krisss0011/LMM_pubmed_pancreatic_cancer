Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) is a rare condition related to a state of hypercoagulability in advanced neoplastic disease. Most of the time, arterial thromboembolic event precedes the diagnosis of NBTE. We report here a case of NBTE responsible for multiple ischaemic strokes, which leads to the diagnosis of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Aortic and mitral valvular regurgitations secondary to NBTE appeared within 6 weeks despite therapeutic anticoagulation with direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) in stroke prevention of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Bivalvular regurgitations resolved 8 weeks after therapeutic switch to low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and chemotherapy. DOACs are a possible alternative to LMWH for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients with active neoplasia. There is a lack of evidence for a clinical efficiency for the prevention of arterial thromboembolism in NBTE. We propose here a short review of the efficacy of anticoagulant therapy for the prevention of arterial thromboembolism in NBTE.
