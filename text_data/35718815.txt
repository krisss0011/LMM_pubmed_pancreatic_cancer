Cancer cells are different from normal cells in regard to phenotypic and functional expression. Cancer is the outcome of aberrant gene expression affecting various cellular signaling pathways. MicroRNAs (MiRs) are small, non-coding RNAs regulating the expression of various protein-coding genes post-transcriptionally and are known to play critical roles in the complicated cellular pathways leading to cell growth, proliferation, development, and apoptosis. MiRs are involved in various cancer-related pathways and function both as tumor suppressor and cancer-causing genes. There is a need for significant biomarkers, and better prognostication of response to a particular treatment and liquid biopsy could be useful to appraise such potential biomarkers. This review has focused on the involvement of anomalous expression of miRs in human pancreatic cancer and the investigation of miR-based biomarkers for disease diagnosis and better therapeutic selection.
