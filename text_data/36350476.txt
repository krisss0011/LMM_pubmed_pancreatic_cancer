Background:Endoscopic ultrasound-guided hepaticogastrostomy with antegrade stenting (EUS-HGAS) is a promising therapeutic option for malignant distal biliary obstruction (MDBO) in the event of transpapillary approach failure. Eliminating the fistula dilation step may further decrease the incidence of adverse events (AE) and simplify the procedure.Aims:This study focused on MDBO associated with pancreatic cancer and aimed to examine the utility of EUS-HGAS without the use of any dilation devices.Methods:This retrospective study investigated consecutive patients in whom the transpapillary approach had failed or was difficult, and who underwent EUS-HGAS without dilation device usage, using a tapered small-diameter catheter, ultrathin delivery system, and tapered dedicated plastic stent. The outcomes of this study included the technical success, clinical success, AE incidence, and recurrent biliary obstruction (RBO) associated with the procedure.Results:During the study period, EUS-HGAS without dilation device usage was attempted for 57 patients with MDBO due to pancreatic cancer. The technical and clinical success rates were 91.2% (52/57) each. The median procedural time was 25 min. The rates of early and late AE besides RBO were 3.5% (2/57) and 1.9% (1/52), respectively. The incidence rate of RBO was 30.8% (16/52), and the median time to RBO was 245 days. The rate of successful endoscopic reintervention for RBO via the fistula was 100% (16/16).Conclusions:EUS-HGAS without the use of dilation devices showed good technical feasibility with a low AE rate. It may be a useful option for MDBO associated with pancreatic cancer when the transpapillary approach is difficult.
