High-risk individuals (HRIs) with familial and genetic predisposition to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are eligible for screening. There is no accurate biomarker for detecting early-stage PDAC. We previously demonstrated that a panel of methylated DNA markers (MDMs) accurately detect sporadic PDAC. In this study we compared the distribution of MDMs in DNA extracted from tissue of PDAC cases who carry germline mutations and non-carriers with family history, with control tissue and demonstrate high discrimination like that seen in sporadic PDAC. These results provide scientific rationale for examining plasma MDMs in HRIs with the goal of developing a minimally-invasive early detection test.
