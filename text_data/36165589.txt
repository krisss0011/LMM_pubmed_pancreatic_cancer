Background:Majority of the pancreatic cancer patients present at an advanced stage and have poor 5 year survival rate. Thus, there is a need for early detection of pancreatic cancer with the initiation of the therapy.Materials & methods:This is a retrospective study including all the endoscopic ultrasound guided (EUS) guided pancreatic FNAs from 2016 to 2020. The aspirate smears were analyzed and classified according to The Papanicolaou Society of Cytopathology System for Reporting Pancreaticobiliary Cytology (PSCPC).Results:A total of 245 EUS guided FNAs from pancreatic lesions were included. Cyto-histological correlation was done wherever available. Category I (non diagnostic) accounted for 40 cases (16%) cases, Category II (negative) comprised of 44 cases (18%); and Category III (Atypical) had 5 cases (2%). Category IV neoplastic-benign category included 3 cases of serous cystadenoma, while neoplastic-others category included pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (n = 21), solid pseudo-papillary neoplasms (SPEN) (n = 12) and mucinous cystic neoplasms (n = 4). A total of 7 cases (2.8%) were reported in Category V (Suspicious). A diagnosis of adenocarcinoma (Category VI) was rendered in 105 cases (42.8%) cases. Rarer types included non Hodgkins lymphoma (n = 3) and one case of primary undifferentiated carcinoma with osteoclastic giant cells. Cyto-histological correlation in all categories was available in 58 cases with 8 false negative cases. Thus overall sensitivity of EUS guided FNAC was found to be 87.8% with a diagnostic yield of 83.6% while sensitivity in diagnosing adenocarcinoma was 96.9%.Conclusion:The present study highlights the spectrum of EUS guided FNA of pancreatic lesions in a subset of North Indian population and classified them according to PSCPC. EUS guided FNAC is a sensitive investigation which plays a crucial role in confirming the diagnosis of pancreatic space occupying lesions (SOLs) in advanced stage.
