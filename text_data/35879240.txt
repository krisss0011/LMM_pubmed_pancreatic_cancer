Pancreatic cancer incidence was double (incidence rate ratio 2.06) in community-based adults with (n = 1291) versus without (n = 5158) type 2 diabetes followed for up to 25 years in the Fremantle Diabetes Study Phase 1. Sustained higher fasting plasma glucose reflecting insulin resistance and fewer comorbidities were statistically significant risk factors in the cohort with diabetes. Past pancreatitis was an aetiologically significant determinant in the cohort as a whole.
