Background:Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive malignant tumor of the digestive system. Its grim prognosis is mainly attributed to the lack of means for early diagnosis and poor response to treatments. Genomic instability is shown to be an important cancer feature and prognostic factor, and its pattern and extent may be associated with poor treatment outcomes in PDAC. Recently, it has been reported that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a key role in maintaining genomic instability. However, the identification and clinical significance of genomic instability-related lncRNAs in PDAC have not been fully elucidated.Methods:Genomic instability-derived lncRNA signature (GILncSig) was constructed based on the results of multiple regression analysis combined with genomic instability-associated lncRNAs and its predictive power was verified by the Kaplan-Meier method. And real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used for simple validation in human cancers and their adjacent non-cancerous tissues. In addition, the correlation between GILncSig and tumor microenvironment (TME) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was investigated by Pearson correlation analysis.Results:The computational framework identified 206 lncRNAs associated with genomic instability in PDAC and was subsequently used to construct a genome instability-derived five lncRNA-based gene signature. Afterwards, we successfully validated its prognostic capacity in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort. In addition,viacareful examination of the transcriptome expression profile of PDAC patients, we discovered that GILncSig is associated with EMT and an adaptive immunity deficient immune profile within TME.Conclusions:Our study established a genomic instability-associated lncRNAs-derived model (GILncSig) for prognosis prediction in patients with PDAC, and revealed the potential functional regulatory role of GILncSig.
