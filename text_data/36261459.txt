Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) is a frequent type of cancer in adults worldwide, and the search for better biomarkers is one of the current challenges. Although RAB7A is associated with tumour progression in multiple tumour types, there are only a few reports in PAAD. Therefore, in this paper, RNA sequencing data were obtained from TCGA(The Cancer Genome Atlas) and GTEx to analyse RAB7A expression and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in PAAD. The functional enrichment of RAB7A-associated DEGs was analysed by protein‒protein interaction (PPI) networks, immune cell infiltration analysis and GO/KEGG analyses. Additionally, Kaplan‒Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to determine the clinical significance of RAB7A in PAAD. High RAB7A expression was associated with poor prognosis in 182 PAAD specimens, including subgroups of patients aged ≤ 65 years, with male sex, not receiving radiotherapy, and with a history of previous alcohol consumption (P < 0.05). Cox regression analysis showed that elevated RAB7A was an independent prognostic factor, and the prognostic nomogram model included radiotherapy status, presence of postoperative tumour residual and histologic grade. Overall, RAB7A overexpression may serve as a biomarker for poor outcome in pancreatic cancer. The DEGs and pathways revealed in this work provide a tentative molecular mechanism for the pathogenesis and progression of PAAD.
