ABSTRACT
We have developed 3D-tumoroids and tumor slice in vitro culture systems from 
surgical tumor specimens derived from patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) or lung 
cancer to evaluate immune cell populations infiltrating cultured tissues. The system 
incorporates patient’s peripherally and tumor-derived immune cells into tumoroid in 
vitro  cultures to evaluate the ability of the culture to mimic an immunosuppressive 
tumor microenvironment (ITM). This system enables analysis of tumor response to 
standard therapy within weeks of surgical resection. Here we show that tumoroid 
cultures from a CRC patient are highly sensitive to the thymidylate synthase inhibitor 
5-fluorouracil (adrucil) but less sensitive to the combination of nucleoside analog 
trifluridine and thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor tipiracil (Lonsurf). Moreover, re-
introduction of isolated immune cells derived from surrounding and infiltrating tumor 
tissue as well as CD45+ tumor infiltrating hematopoietic cells displayed prolonged 
(>10 days) survival in co-culture. Established tumor slice cultures were found to 
contain both an outer epithelial and inner stromal cell compartment mimicking tumor 
structure  in vivo . 
Collectively, these data suggest that, 3D-tumoroid and slice culture assays may 
provide a feasible in vitro  approach to assess efficacy of novel therapeutics in the 
context of heterogeneous tumor-associated cell types including immune and non-
transformed stromal cells. In addition,  delineating the impact of therapeutics on 
immune cells, and cell types involved in therapeutic resistance mechanisms may be 
possible in general or for patient-specific responses.
INTRODUCTION
Historically, the successful establishment of 
exponentially growing viable cells from patient-derived tumors in in vitro  cell cultures has been found to occur 
from a minority of tumor tissues following artificial 
selection of a sub-population of tumor cells. Such 
limitations make it difficult to model patient variability in                                            Priority Research PaperOncotarget66748

drug responses  in vitro . Moreover, the lack of stromal cells 
that play a critical role in tumor viability, growth and drug 
response in vivo  make the prediction of tumor response of 
immune-based therapeutics challenging. Through recent 
advances in three-dimensional (3D) culture (“tumoroid”) 
methodologies some of these hurdles are beginning to 
be addressed. However, it is currently unclear to what 
extent such models can be engineered to retain important 
phenotypic properties of infiltrating immune cells from the 
tumor tissue of origin that mimic the in vivo  environment. 
A long-standing desire has been to test tumor tissues 
from patients to rapidly prognosticate treatment outcomes 
in vitro  and develop treatment strategies that account for 
inter- and intra-patient tumor heterogeneity. Although 
the methodology to establish tissue in vitro  cultures 
has been available for more than a century [1], the use 
of two dimensional (2D) culture techniques to establish 
continuous tumor cell lines from explanted tumor tissue 
cultures is hampered by artificial culture conditions that 
severely diminish the success rate, and tumor clonal 
heterogeneity. Further, time constraints render this 
approach impractical for clinical application to derive drug 
response profiles of tumors for specific patients. Recent 
advances in patient-derived 3D cultures have facilitated 
what is perhaps more relevant modeling of cancer in vitro  
and this can be combined with whole-genome sequencing 
approaches to couple functional and correlative tumor-
specific data with the promise to shape the landscape of 
precision medicine.  3D in vitro  tumoroid cultures can be 
rapidly established from biopsied or resected tumor tissues 
and subsequently subjected to in vitro  sub-cultivation, 
expansion and genomic manipulation using e.g. CRISPR/
Cas9 methodology [2]. Patient-specific tumoroid 
response profiles have been established in relation to their 
genomic profiles following high-throughput screening 
against cytotoxic drug libraries [3, 4]. Clinical trials are 
currently ongoing to determine whether this approach can 
prognosticate treatment outcome of pancreatic, liver and 
colorectal cancer patients [5, 6]. Interestingly, tumoroid 
cultures also maintain the tumor heterogeneity of the 
tumor-of-origin and since normal surrounding tissues 
can be established in addition with little modification to 
the culture media, a patient disease-specific genomic or 
proteomic tumor profile can be established in relation 
to the normal tissue from which the tumor arose [5, 7]. 
Tumoroid cultures can also be implanted orthotopically 
in immunodeficient mice to address the impact of disease-
specific driver genes and their impact on the tumoroid’s 
capacity to metastasize to distant organs [8].
Although tumoroid 3D cultures allow the expansion 
of the tumor epithelium they are typically devoid of non-
epithelial stromal cells from the tumor-of-origin and 
therefore their use is limited in addressing therapeutic 
strategies targeting this compartment. The ability to retain 
tumor specimens with stroma is important to establish 
models that can represent in vivo  tumor biology with a microenvironment including stromal and immune cells 
that play a prominent role in modulating processes such as 
tumor progression and immune evasion [9-12]. Alternative 
in vitro  culturing methodologies have been employed to 
maintain the heterogeneous tumor microenvironment by 
embedding tissue fragments in a 3D culture matrix in 
an air-liquid interface culture system (ALI) to maintain 
a polarized epithelial cell layer in close proximity to 
stromal cells. This culture system has been shown to 
yield expanding cystic structures from neonatal small 
intestine for up to 350 days in culture [13]. The wall of the 
intestinal cysts consists of a polarized epithelial monolayer 
with an apical inner luminal surface and a basal outer 
surface in close proximity to alpha-smooth muscle actin 
expressing myofibroblasts containing fully differentiated 
microstructures of cultured intestinal epithelial cells when 
expanded in collagen [13]. Furthermore, this ALI model 
system may be used for oncogenic in vitro  transformation 
of primary epithelial and mesenchymal explanted colon, 
stomach and pancreatic mouse tissues from mice [14]. 
Here we have optimized a novel 3D culture 
methodology to investigate and characterize resected 
tumor tissue in the presence of stromal and immune cells. 
This system can maintain primary tumor cells and an 
associated tumor microenvironment for up to forty-four 
(44) days following isolation. Importantly, these cultures 
maintain expression of the soluble tumor markers CA19-9 
and CEA similar to those of the primary tumor in patients. 
Application of this system enabled immune profiling of 
blood and tumor tissue that found patients with reduced 
numbers of NK cells and increased presence of immune-
related myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in 
their tumors, indicating a potential immunosuppressive 
profile. Interestingly, we observe reduced levels of CD3 
expressing cells in our slice culture despite retention of 
CD45+ cells. This primary culture model system may be 
useful for identifying in vitro  drug response as well as 
biomarker assessment to help guide personalized therapy 
and molecular profiles to define predicative molecular 
profiles of drug responsive tumors.
RESULTS
Establishment of tumoroid air-liquid interface 
(ALI) 3D cultures and tumoroids
We established 3D tumoroid cultures from resected 
tumor tissues of patients who provided their informed 
consent and underwent surgery at Fox Chase Cancer 
Center (Table 1). There were four (4) tissue specimens 
of colorectal cancer isolated from various segments; two 
(2) specimens were obtained from the colon and two (2) 
specimens were obtained from the rectum. We were able 
to establish both 3D ALI cultures and epithelial tumoroid Oncotarget66749
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget
cultures from three (3) out of four (4) of the tissues that 
were provided (Table 1). In one case (ReCa030917), 
we were also able to establish organoid cultures from 
adjacent normal mucosa. Upon troubleshooting the case 
(ReCa091516) from which we failed to prepare tumoroid 
and ALI cultures it was discovered that the specimen 
that was processed only contained fibrous stroma and 
was completely devoid of tumor epithelium. A similar 
situation was also present in the case of the pancreatic 
cancer specimen (Table 1) where we obtained <0.5 cm3 of 
tumor tissue. Upon histological inspection of H/E stained 
tissues, approximately 10 - 15% of the tissue-of-origin 
used for cell culturing contained tumor epithelium with 
the rest of the tissue specimen containing tumor stroma 
- a common feature of pancreatic cancers. Although, this 
did not prevent us from establishing 3D ALI cultures it 
had a negative effect on establishing epithelial tumoroid 
cultures that could be subjected to sub-passaging. Tumor 
tissues were also obtained from three (3) non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who underwent 
surgical resection. These specimens included two (2) 
squamous NSCLC tissues and one (1) adenocarcinoma 
NSCLC tissue. We successfully established 3D epithelial 
tumoroids and ALI cultures from all the lung cancer 
specimens. However, the squamous NSCLC tumoroids 
(isolated from two different patients) propagated poorly 
under our in vitro  culture conditions and underwent 
senescence after two (2) passages. By contrast, we were able to propagate tumoroids established from the lung 
adenocarcinoma (NSCLC) case for eight (8) passages. 
These lung adenocarcinomas tumoroid cultures were also 
subjected to drug screening experiments. 
Growth factor-dependent selection of CRC 
3D cultures enrich for tumoroids expressing 
established tumor markers
The epithelial CRC tumoroid cultures were 
established from multicellular aggregates in matrigel and 
grown according to what has previously been described 
[15] (Figure 1A). In order to promote the selection of 
cancer cells, WNT3A was excluded from the chemically 
defined WENRAS media as previously described [3]. One 
of the CRC tumoroid specimens was relatively insensitive 
to growth factor deprivation of the WENRAS media 
including depletion of noggin, EGF, WNT3A and rspo1/
WNT3A as determined by calcein uptake (Figure 1B). 
However, the CRC tumoroids were highly sensitive to 
treatment with doses of the MDM2 inhibitor nutlin3A to 
promote selection of CRC tumoroids with mutant Tp53 
[16] (Figure 1B). Indeed, this CRC tumoroid expressed 
the tumor marker EpCam, beta-catenin and nuclear levels 
of p53 in the absence of p53-triggering stimuli in culture 
in vitro  (Figure 1C-1D). Our data reinforce prior published 
findings that tumoroids expressing tumor-specific markers

can be quickly established from small amounts of resected 
tumor specimens.
ALI cultures express the tumor markers CA19-9 
and CEA
To further investigate the expression of tumor 
markers in 3D tumoroid cultures we chose to analyze the 
expression of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) and 
the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) tumor shed antigens 
(TSAs) commonly used clinically as cancer biomarkers 
[17-19]. In order to verify tumor-specific expression of 
these biomarkers, we performed immunohistochemical 
(IHC) staining of the tumor-of-origin and respective 
ALI 3D tumor culture (Figure 2A and 2B). Although, the 
NSCLC culture stained positive for CEA (both squamous 
cell and adenocarcinoma) they were devoid of staining for 
CA19-9 (Figure 2A). By contrast, the CRC ALI cultures 
expressed high levels of both CEA and CA19-9 (Figure 
2B). We investigated whether these cultures also shed the 
biomarkers in the media after prolonged culture and how 
the levels compare to the levels present in the serum of 
the patient from which these tumor tissues originated. In 
order to address this question, we determined the levels of CEA and CA19-9 using ELISA (Figure 2C and 2D). 
Indeed, as predicted by IHC, 3D ALI tumor cultures with 
high expression of CA19-9 and/or CEA also shed readily 
detectable amounts of these biomarkers in their media up 
to forty-four (44) days after establishing the ALI in vitro  
cultures. From this followed that only cultures from the 
pancreatic tumor and CRC expressed high levels of CA19-
9 in the media whereas 3D ALI cultures of NSCLC did 
not shed CA19-9 in the media nor was this biomarker 
abnormally elevated in the serum of such patients (Figure 
2C and 2D). Collectively, our data suggest that tumor 3D 
ALI cultures can retain the expression pattern of clinically 
relevant tumor biomarkers that are present within the 
tumor-of-origin for an extended period of time in culture.
Immune cell profiling of tumors and patient blood 
reveal differential infiltration of immune cells in 
donor tissues
A critically important component of the tumor 
microenvironment is the presence of immune cells that 
can promote or inhibit tumor progression. In order to 
address to what extent our organoid 3D ALI cultures 
contained immune cells with potential importance for

tumor etiology or the tumor response to immune oncology 
drugs we performed immune profiling on blood and tumor 
tissue from patients from which we established 3D ALI 
in vitro  cultures (Figure 3). Data from one patient with 
lung adenocarcinomas indicated an increased number 
of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs; CD206+/
CD33+/HLA-DR-) and double negative (CD4-/CD8-)  
T cells infiltrating this tumor when compared to the 
corresponding numbers of these cells in the blood (Table 2). By contrast, the number of tumor infiltrating NK 
cells and monocytes were significantly reduced within 
the tumor as compared to the numbers in blood. Taken 
together this may indicate immune suppression of the 
tumor-of-origin suggesting that correlating the immune 
profiles of patients with the donating tumor tissue could 
yield important information with respect to subsequent 
analysis of the tumor tissues in the 3D ALI cultures. To 
address potential differences in longevity of immune cells

in our 3D ALI cultures we performed IHC on the cultured 
tissues (Figure 3). Interestingly, in our CRC in vitro  
cultures we observed the frequent presence of CD45+ cells 
in the tumor-of-origin. Indeed, CD45+ cells were also 
present in the cultured tissue following eight (8) days of 
in vitro  3D culture (Figure 3). By contrast, we observed a 
marked drop in the number of CD3+ cells as compared to 
the tumor-of-origin following the same length of culturing. 
This would suggest that although CD45+ hematopoietic 
cells are present in both the tumor-of-origin and the 3D 
cultures of CRC tissue, there is a marked reduction in the 
number of CD3+ cells under these culture conditions.
Evaluation of cytotoxic responses in cancer 3D 
organoid cultures reveals differential responses to 
FDA-approved drugs
To investigate drug responses in the 3D cultures, 
we established 3D tumoroids from a resected colon 
adenocarcinoma (Figure 4A) and cultured these in the 
absence of WNT3A as previously shown (Figure 1B). 
These cultures retained some of the cytological hallmarks 
of the tumor-of-origin as evident by H/E staining (Figure 
4C). Next, we subjected these tumoroid cultures to 
screening using FDA-approved compounds commonly 
used to treat colorectal cancer. We also included the MEK-
inhibitor trametinib which is not yet approved for CRC 
therapy but has shown promising single-agent activity 
in a previously published drug screen of CRC tumoroids 
[3] (Figure 4B). After five (5) days of culture we found 
that CRC patient tumoroids are particularly sensitive to 
treatment with the approved drugs 5-fluoruracil (5-FU) 
and trametinib. Furthermore, regorafenib, cetuximab and 
irinotecan (CPT-11) in descending order provided similar 
dose-response profiles but with higher IC50 values as compared to 5-FU. Oxaliplatin and TAS-102 (trifluridine/
tipiracil) did not yield interpretable dose-response 
profiles for the drug concentrations that were tested. Our 
data indicates that 3D tumoroid in vitro  cultures can be 
interrogated in a high-throughput format using cytotoxic 
drugs within weeks following surgery.
DISCUSSION
Recent advances in 3D tumoroid culture 
methodology have enabled scientists to replicate the 
complex tumor organ system composed of multiple cell 
lineages including tumor epithelium, stromal cells and 
vasculature in vitro  to better study the complex interaction 
of these cells in supporting tumor growth and potential 
drug response. Both the normal and tumor epithelium 
can now be readily cultured from biopsies, propagated 
and expanded in vitro  using defined culture conditions. 
Advances in generating tumoroids from pancreatic cancer 
[20], glioblastoma [21], prostate cancer [22, 23] and 
colorectal cancer [3] reveal that patient-derived tumoroids 
recapitulate patient-specific histological features. 
These tumoroids can also be cryopreserved in a similar 
manner as continuous cell lines and can subsequently be 
characterized by genomics, transcriptomics and using 
high-throughput in vitro  drug screening assays, something 
that has spurred initiatives to develop live patient-derived 
tumoroid biobanks [1]. It is possible that data from 
tumoroid drug screening assays not only will complement 
and corroborate tumor genomic data but may in addition 
provide prediction on drug responses where sequencing 
data alone might fall short. Unfortunately, at this time the 
tumoroid systems are limited in their capacity to predict 
responses to novel promising immune oncology drugs 
since they promote the expansion of the tumor epithelium Table 2: Immune cells in blood and tumor specimen used to establish 3D cultures.

and do not support the maintenance and expansion of 
patient-specific immune and stromal cells that contribute 
to an immune suppressive tumor microenvironment. 
Here we show that 3D ALI tumoroid cultures that 
include a patient-specific stromal component can be 
maintained from resected solid tumor specimens when 
cultured in a Matrigel matrix for up to forty-four (44) 
days as determined by the expression of TSA biomarkers 
CEA and CA19-9 in the media. Previous studies on mouse 
neonatal small intestinal specimens indicate that tissue 
can be preserved for at least 350 days when isolated from 
young mice using a similar system [13]. The longevity 
estimate here would suggest that the living tumor cells 
are being preserved in our system and it may be possible 
to extend the life of the cell population. Thus, our 
finding might be less surprising considering the previous 
discoveries. However, it remains to be addressed to what 
extent the different cell populations are maintained in the 
stroma when compared to the donating tumor-of-origin. 
For example, although we readily detect CD45+ cells 
in the 3D ALI cultures, a clear reduction in the presence 
of CD3+ cells in the tissues was observed following eight (8) days in culture. Moreover, we were only able 
to document outgrowth of tumor-associated fibroblasts 
in one of our squamous 3D ALI NSCLC cultures 
suggesting that the culture conditions did not support 
the long-term expansion of the stromal compartment. 
The above might be less surprising since the chemically-
defined WENRAS media employed in this study do 
not contain growth factors that can support for myeloid 
and lymphocytic cells, including FGF and interleukins. 
In fact, one component of the WENRAS media is the 
signaling peptide noggin which acts as an inhibitor of the 
bone morphogenic protein-4 (BMP-4), a member of the 
transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily 
[24]. BMP signaling limits hyper-proliferation of the 
intestinal epithelium and maintains differentiation along 
the crypt-villus axis by forming a gradient of BMP-
activity where mesenchymal cells beneath the crypts 
express high levels of noggin whereas high levels of 
BMP-2 and-4 are expressed by mesenchymal cells 
both in the crypt and the villi [25-28]. Recent evidence 
has also shown that BMP-signaling constrains the self-
renewal of Lgr5+ cells via SMAD-mediated repression

of the stem cell signature [29]. SMAD4 expression is 
frequently lost in invasive colorectal cancer, indicating 
that the quenching of the BMP-signaling pathway in CRC 
tumoroids through noggin supplementation may be less 
essential for successful tumoroid in vitro  culture [30, 31]. 
Indeed, one of our CRC tumoroid cultures was completely 
refractory to the withdrawal of recombinant noggin from 
the WENRAS media. Thus, further optimization of the 
growth factors that constitute the WENRAS media is 
likely necessary to support the diverse cell types that 
constitute the tumor stroma.
In conclusion, tumor 3D ALI cultures retain the 
capacity to maintain tumor stroma and characteristics of 
the primary tumor including the long-term production of 
CEA and CA19-9 TSAs (>44 days) following isolation. 
CA19-9 and CEA are commonly used to monitor CRC in 
the clinic. In our system, the pancreatic cancer specimens 
expressed high levels of CA19-9 consistent with this being 
a biomarker often used to detect and monitor treatment 
of patients with pancreatic cancer. Profiling of immune 
cell content in the blood and tumors from patients have 
identified varying populations of myeloid-derived 
suppressor cells (MDSC), double-negative T cells (DNT), 
mature NK cells, and monocytes across each tumoroid 
that appear to correlate with growth and drug response. 
The fact that these cultures maintain the production 
of TSAs makes tumoroids useful to better understand 
the effects TSAs have on tumor immune suppression. 
Recently, Kline et al. have shown that the CA125 TSA 
is immunosuppressive to antibody-based tumor therapies 
[32]. This system will enable better understanding of 
how the alternative immunosuppressive mechanism can 
affect the growth and stasis of tumors in the presence of 
of a given patient’s immune system. Additional studies 
are being designed to better understand the relationship 
of these cell subtypes and response to therapeutics with 
the immune microenvironment within the tumoroid cell 
culture.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tissue isolation and blood collection
Surgically resected tumor tissues were obtained 
from eleven (11) patients subjected to treatment at Fox 
Chase Cancer Center (FCCC). Patient material was 
collected from a total of five (5) colorectal cancer cases, 
three (3) NSCLC cancer cases, two (2) cases of pancreatic 
cancer and one (1) case of cholangiocarcinoma. Tissue 
fragments representative of what was used for in vitro  
culture were sampled and fixed in formalin overnight. The 
remaining tissues were chopped into approximately 5-mm 
pieces and washed with cold PBS as previously described 
[15, 33]. Blood was collected in K2-EDTA blood collection tubes (BD Vacutainer Lavender) and serum 
blood collection tube (BD Vacutainer Red Top) from each 
patient immediately prior to surgery. Blood was subjected 
to RBC lysis solution (BioLegend) to remove red blood 
cells and washed in ice cold PBS/2%FCS. The remaining 
WBCs were stored at 4oC in Streck Cell Preservative™ 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) and subsequently analyzed by 
flow cytometry. Blood was also allowed to clot and the 
serum was separated by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 
3,500 rpm, aliquoted and stored at -80oC. All experiments 
with patient tissues were performed according an approved 
protocol from the Institutional Review Board of FCCC 
and all patient tissue or blood samples were obtained with 
informed consent.
Establishment of 3D air-liquid interface (ALI) & 
tumoroid cultures
ALI cultures were generated in a similar manner as 
previously described [13]. Cell culture inserts (Millicell-
CM, Millipore) for 24-well plates were coated with 
Matrigel (BD bioscience) to generate an acellular bottom 
layer. The Matrigel was allowed to solidify for 10 minutes 
at 37oC. The tumor tissue fragments were washed in ice-
cold PBS and minced rapidly by using iris scissors on a 
cold tissue culture plate to prevent drying of the tissue. 
Approximately 30-50 mg of minced tissue was mixed 
with 400 µL of ice-cold Matrigel by pipetting using a 
2.0 ml pipette and transfer to the cell culture insert. The 
tissue was allowed to solidify for 10 minutes at 37oC. 
The outer dish was subsequently filled to cover the 
acellular layer with WENRAS media [14, 30] (advanced 
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium/F12 [Invitrogen] 
supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin [Invitrogen], 
10 mmol/L HEPES [Invitrogen], Glutamax [Invitrogen],

and RSPO1-conditioned media. The media was also 
supplemented with A83-01, SB202190 and Y-27632 
as described previously [15]. Tumoroid cultures were 
prepared by washing the tissue fragments 6-8 times in 10 
mL of ice-cold PBS allowing the tissue to settle after each 
wash and removing the supernatant. The fragments were 
incubated in digestion buffer containing collagenase IV 
and dispase II for approximately one (1) hour at 37oC. The 
supernatant was collected in a 15-ml tube and centrifuged 
for 3 minutes at 200 x g. The supernatant was collected 
and tumor infiltrating immune cells were enriched by 
using Percoll separation as previously as described [34] 
for immune cell profiling (see below). The supernatant 
was washed in PBS once, the pellet was dissolved and 
the number of tissue fragments were counted, seeded in 
40 µl of Matrigel at a density of 25-40 tumoroids/24-well 
and cultured in WENRAS medium. The WENRAS media Oncotarget66755

was changed every other day and the tumoroids were 
passaged at a 1:2 - 1:6 ratio approximately once every 
week as previously described [15] using TrypLExpress 
(Invitrogen) supplemented with Y-27632 (Sigma-Aldrich).
Drugs used in this study were obtained from the 
following sources: Cetuximab (Fox Chase Cancer Center 
Pharmacy), 5-FU (Fox Chase Cancer Center Pharmacy), 
CPT-11 (Fox Chase Cancer Center Pharmacy), oxaliplatin 
(Fox Chase Cancer Center Pharmacy), regorafenib 
(MedKoo, catalogue #202436), TAS-102 (MedKoo, 
catalogue #205641), trametinib (MedKoo, catalogue 
#201458).
ELISA
Serum samples and media were collected at various 
time points following 3D tumoroid culture. The total 
protein content was determined in each sample using the 
BSA Protein Assay Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific). The 
protein levels were normalized and subsequently subjected 
to ELISA for human CEA (ThermoFisher Scientific) 
and human CA19-9 (ThermoFisher Scientific). The 
protein standards, media and serum samples were diluted 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The resulting 
colorimetric reaction was analyzed at 562 nm using a 
Beckman Coulter DTX880 Multimode Detector. The 
levels of protein present in each sample were determined 
mathematically from the straight-line equation of the 
standard curve.
Histopathology and immunohistochemistry
Tumoroids and 3D ALI tumor cultures were fixed 
in formalin and embedded in paraffin. Cut sections were 
stained with H/E. Slide sections were rehydrated and 
subjected to antigen retrieval in citric acid buffer (1.0 
mM, pH 6.0). Endogenous peroxidases were blocked with 
3% hydrogen peroxide. The slides were blocked for 30 
minutes in 5% goat serum and subsequently incubated 
with the primary rabbit antibodies towards CD45 
(ab10559, AbCam), CD3 (ThermoFisher Scientific), 
CEA (A0115, Dako) and CA19-9 (M3517, Dako) at 
room temperature overnight. Slides were then washed 
and incubated with secondary peroxidase conjugated 
antibodies using the ImmPRESS™ HRP Anti-Rabbit/
Mouse IgG (Peroxidase) Polymer Detection Kit (Vector 
Laboratories). Following washes in PBS, the slides were 
stained using the 3,3’-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride 
(DAB) Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP) Substrate Kit, 
3,3’-diaminobenzidine (Vector Laboratories). The slides 
were counterstained using hematoxylin. Profiling of immune cells in patient blood and 
tumor tissue
White blood cells (WBC) and tumor-infiltrating 
cells were divided into a myeloid staining category (CD80, 
CD68, CD206, CD16, HLA-DR, CD14, CD33, CD45 
and propidium iodide [PI]) and a T-cell staining category 
(CD329, CD328, CD94, CD16, CD4, CD117, CD56, 
CD3, CD8, CD45 and PI). Stained cells were analyzed on 
a Beckton-Dickinson (BD) ARIA II flow cytometer with 
four lasers at 633-, 488-, 405- and 365-nm wavelengths 
(Cell Sorting Facility, Fox Chase Cancer Center). Data 
were collected with BD FACS Diva software version 6 
and analyzed with Flowjo v9.2 (Tree Star Inc.). Single-cell 
events were first gated by a forward scatter height versus 
forward scatter area plot and viable CD45+ cells were then 
gated by lack of PI staining and analyzed for the surface 
markers indicated for the myeloid and NK/T-cell category.
