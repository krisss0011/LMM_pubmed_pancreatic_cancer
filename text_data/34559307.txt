The majority of the previous reports on NK cells use cross-sectional studies to establish the status of patient NK cell function, however such studies fail to evaluate the immune status of the patients on a continuous basis from the disease-free stage to progression of cancer. In this study, we performed a prospective study of the immune function by continuously monitoring the NK numbers, expansion and function of a pancreatic cancer patient from 1/6/2016 to 2/14/2019. The results indicated that at initial stages of the disease where no overt disease was identified, the patient had consistently higher percentages of NK and B cells and lower percentages of CD3 + T cells in the peripheral blood. The percentages of CD14 + monocytes were similar at the initial stages of the disease, and at the later stages of the disease, it increased and remained higher in the patient when compared to those from healthy donors. The numbers of expanded NK cells and the cytotoxic function, as well as secretion of IFN-γ from primary and osteoclast expanded patient NK cells remained consistently low throughout the years of follow up. Similarly, the majority of cytokines in patient's serum remained lower with the exception of IL-6 which was higher. The IFN-γ secreted from the patients' NK cells had much lower ability to differentiate the poorly differentiated oral tumors as assessed by their lack of ability to upregulate differentiation antigens. Overall, before any evidence of overt disease, patient NK cells exhibited significant dysfunction. Intervention at the stage of no disease or minimal disease may be important for the prevention of pancreatic cancer progression.
