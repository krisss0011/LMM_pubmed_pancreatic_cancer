The aim of the present study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms of zinc‑finger protein 217 (ZNF217) in pancreatic carcinoma (PC) progression. ZNF217‑associated expression and survival data from patients with PC were retrieved from the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis server. The mRNA expression level of ZNF217 was detected by reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR. Cell Counting Kit‑8, colony formation, wound‑healing and Transwell assays were conducted to assess cellular proliferation, migratory and invasive abilities. Proliferation was also examined by immunofluorescence detection of Ki67 expression, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and luciferase reporter assays were performed to detect the interaction between ZNF217 and interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5). ZNF217 was found to be significantly upregulated in tumor tissues and cancer cell lines, which was associated with a poor survival rate in patients with PC. ZNF217 silencing markedly suppressed cellular proliferation and migratory and invasive abilities, as well as decreased the expression of Ki67. IRF5 was also upregulated in PC tumor tissues and was shown to positively regulate the activity of the ZNF217 promoter and its mRNA expression levels. Furthermore, ChIP assays demonstrated that IRF5 bound to the promoter region of ZNF217in vitro. In conclusion, ZNF217 silencing exerted notable inhibitory effects on the progression of PC. Thus, ZNF217 may serve as a potential target for developing novel therapeutic strategies for PC.
