The correlation between dysregulation of splicing and cancers has been increasingly recognised and confirmed. The identification of valuable alternative splicing (AS) in pancreatic head cancer (PHC) has a great significance. AS profiles in PHC were generated using the data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and TCGASpliceSeq. Then, the NMF clustering method was performed to identify overall survival-associated AS (OS-AS) subtypes in PHC patients. Subsequently, we used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator Cox regression analysis to construct an AS-related risk model. The splicing regulatory network was uncovered by Cytoscape 3.7. A total of 1694 OS-AS events were obtained. The PHC patients were divided into clusters 1 and 2. Cluster 1 had poorer prognosis and lower infiltration of immune cells. Subsequently, a prognostic signature was established that showed good performance in predicting OS and progression-free survival. The risk score of this signature was associated with the unique tumour immunity. Moreover, a nomogram incorporating the risk score and clinicopathological parameters was established. Finally, a splicing factor-AS regulatory network was developed. A comprehensive analysis of the AS events in PHC associated with prognosis and tumour immunity may help provide reliable information to guide individual treatment strategies.
