The effect of tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 9 (TNFSF9) on the metastasis of pancreatic cancer (PC) and the underlying mechanism remain unclear. We studied the expression of TNFSF9 in pancreatic cancer and its relationship with immune cells. We further explored the effect of TNFSF9 on pancreatic cancer metastasis by inducing macrophage polarization, and evaluated the expression of Src/FAK/p-Akt/IL-1β signals in macrophages after knocking down TNFSF9. The data shows that TNFSF9 expression is elevated in pancreatic cancer and is related to the poor prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer. In addition, TNFSF9 may induce the M2 polarization of macrophages through Src/FAK/p-Akt/IL-1β signals, thereby promoting the migration of pancreatic cancer cells. In conclusion, our data reveals that TNFSF9 may become a predictive biomarker of pancreatic cancer and provides a new intervention target for the immunotherapy of pancreatic cancer.
