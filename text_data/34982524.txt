Inefficient intracellular gene release and transfection limit nonviral gene delivery applications in cancer therapy. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsive nonviral gene delivery is the most widely explored strategy for such applications, yet the development of fast and safe ROS responsive nanocarriers proves to be a challenge because of the intracellular chemical equilibrium of high ROS and glutathione levels. Here, we report an ultrasound-enhanced ROS responsive charge-reversal polymeric nanocarrier (BTIL) for fast and efficient pancreatic cancer gene delivery. The BTIL is composed of B-PDEAEA/DNA polyplex-based cores and IR780-loaded liposome coatings. The IR780 is able to produce an excess of ROS under low intensity ultrasound irradiation, thus disequilibrating the chemical equilibrium of ROS and glutathione, and promoting the ROS-responsive positive-to-negative charge-reversal of the B-PDEAEA polymer. This charge conversion results in fast polyplex dissociation and intracellular gene release, inducing efficient gene transfection and cancer cell apoptosis. Moreover, following the intravenous administration, BTIL maintains a stable and long circulation in the bloodstream, achieves orthotopic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma distribution, and exhibits potent antitumor activity with negligible side effects. Our results reveal the proposed strategy to be both promising and universal for the development of fast and safe ROS responsive nonviral gene delivery in cancer therapy.
