Type 2 diabetes is known as a risk factor for pancreatic cancer (PC). Various genetic and environmental factors cause both these global chronic diseases. The mechanisms that define their relationships are complex and poorly understood. Recent studies have implicated that metabolic abnormalities, including hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, could lead to cell damage responses, cell transformation, and increased cancer risk. Hence, these kinds of abnormalities following molecular events could be essential to develop our understanding of this complicated link. Among different molecular events, focusing on shared signaling pathways including metabolic (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) and mitogenic (MAPK) pathways in addition to regulatory mechanisms of gene expression such as those involved in non-coding RNAs (miRNAs, circRNAs, and lncRNAs) could be considered as powerful tools to describe this association. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the development of type 2 diabetes and pancreatic cancer would help us to find a new research area for developing therapeutic and preventive strategies. For this purpose, in this review, we focused on the shared molecular events resulting in type 2 diabetes and pancreatic cancer. First, a comprehensive literature review was performed to determine similar molecular pathways and non-coding RNAs; then, the final results were discussed in more detail.
