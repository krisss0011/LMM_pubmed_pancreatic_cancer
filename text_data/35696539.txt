Persister cancer cells represent rare populations of cells resistant to therapy. Cancer cells can exploit epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity to adopt a drug-tolerant state that does not depend on genetic alterations. Small molecules that can interfere with cell plasticity or kill cells in a cell state-dependent manner are highly sought after. Salinomycin has been shown to kill cancer cells in the mesenchymal state by sequestering iron in lysosomes, taking advantage of the iron addiction of this cell state. Here, we report the chemo- and stereoselective synthesis of a series of structurally complex small molecule chimeras of salinomycin derivatives and the iron-reactive dihydroartemisinin. We show that these chimeras accumulate in lysosomes and can react with iron to release bioactive species, thereby inducing ferroptosis in drug-tolerant pancreatic cancer cells and biopsy-derived organoids of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. This work paves the way toward the development of new cancer medicines acting through active ferroptosis.
