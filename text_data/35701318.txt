Background:The different oncological outcomes of invasive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (I-IPMN) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are debated. This study aimed to compare disease recurrence patterns and histopathological characteristics in patients with resected I-IPMN and PDAC.Methods:Consecutive patients undergoing surgical resection for stage I-III I-IPMN or PDAC between 2010 and 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy or resected for Tis neoplasia were excluded. All surgical specimens were re-staged according to AJCC-8th-edition.Results:A total of 330 patients were included, of whom 43 had I-IPMN and 287 had PDAC. Median follow-up time was 26.7 (1.3-92.3) months and estimated median disease-free survival (DFS) was 60.3 months (47.2-73.4) for I-IPMN and 23.8 (19.3-28.2) months for PDAC (p < 0.001). During follow-up, 32.6% of I-IPMN and 67.9% of PDAC patients experienced recurrence (p < 0.001). The sites of first recurrence were the lungs (38.5% vs 13.1%, p = 0.027), liver (28.6% vs 45.0%, p = 0.180) and local (15.4% vs 36.6%, p = 0.101) for I-IPMN and PDAC, respectively. At multivariate analysis, I-IPMN histology remained an independent predictive factor for longer DFS (OR 0.528, CI 95% 0.278-1.000, p = 0.050), regardless of stage or adjuvant chemotherapy. I-IPMN and PDAC differed in rates of neuroinvasion (51.2% vs 97.2%) and positive lymph node status (N+) (46.5% vs 82.7%), especially in patients with lower T status.Conclusion:I-IPMN showed a different recurrence pattern compared to PDAC, with a higher lung tropism, and longer DFS. This different biological behavior is associated with lower rates of neuroinvasion and nodal involvement, especially in early-stage disease.
