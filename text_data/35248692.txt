Researches on the prognosis of pancreatic cancer is of great significance to improve the patient treatment effect and survival. Current researches mainly focus on the prediction of the survival status and the determination of prognostic markers. Each patient has its own characteristics, there is no report about the prediction of survival time. However, accurate prediction of survival time is critical for personalized medicine. In this paper, a hybrid algorithm of Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) was used to construct a quantitative prediction model of Overall Survival (OS) for pancreatic cancer patients, 70 RNAs related to OS were determined, including 33 mRNAs, 28 lncRNAs, and 9 miRNAs. The results of 10-fold cross-validation (R2is 0.9693) and the generalization ability (R2is 0.9666) showed that the model has reliable predictive performance and these 70 RNAs are important factors influencing the OS of pancreatic cancer patients. To further study the relationship between RNA-RNA interaction and the survival, competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulation network was constructed. Degree centrality, betweenness centrality and closeness centrality of nodes in the ceRNA network showed that hsa-mir-570, hsa-mir-944, hsa-mir-6506, hsa-mir-3136, MMP16, PLGLB2, HPGD, FUT1, MFSD2A, SULT1E1, SLC13A5, ZNF488, F2RL2, TNFRSF8, TNFSF11, FHDC1, ISLR2 and THSD7B are hub nodes, which are key RNAs closely determining the OS of pancreatic cancer patients.
