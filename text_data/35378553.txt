Background:In recent years, there have been changes in the treatment of ductal pancreatic carcinoma with regard to multimodal therapy and also surgical therapy. These changes have not yet been explored in large nationwide studies in Germany. The present work gives an initial overview from a surgical perspective of the developments in diagnosis, therapy and survival of pancreatic cancer within the last 19 years in Germany.Methods:In this cohort of 18 clinical cancer registries in Germany, patients with a diagnosis of ductal pancreatic cancer from 2000-2018 were included. The patients were categorised according to the years of diagnosis (2000-2009 vs. 2010-2018) and treatment modalities and compared.Results:In the cohort of approx. 48000 patients with ductal pancreatic cancer, the number of newly diagnosed cases increased from approx. 18000 to 30000 patients in the two ten-year periods. The median overall survival increased slightly but statistically significantly from 7.1 to 7.9 months (p < 0.001). The resection rate increased from 25% to 32%, with the proportion of patients for whom no specific therapy was reported decreased by 11%. The rate of palliative chemotherapy and neoadjuvant chemotherapy also increased from 16% to 20% of the patients and from less than 1% to 2% of the patients, respectively. The median survival in the curatively treated subgroups was up to 24 months.Summary:The cancer registry data appear to confirm the known increase in the incidence of pancreatic cancer in the western world. Resection rates and the rates of treatment with neoadjuvant and palliative intent also increased. The overall survival of all patients with ductal pancreatic cancer only increased marginally. In the subgroups of patients who were treated with curative intent, however, significantly longer survival times were found.
