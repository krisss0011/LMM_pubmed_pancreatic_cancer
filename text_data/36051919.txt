[18F]FDG as a probe of PET/CT is a radiolabeled glucose analogue taken up by most cells, but its batch activity is limited. [68Ga]FAPI-04 is a promising alternative based on a fibroblast activation protein-specific inhibitor (FAPI) labeled with radiotracer FAP. Here, a series of databases suggested that FAP expression was significantly different in pancreatic cancer compared to normal tissue. The FAP-positive fibroblasts were evaluated around the tumor cells and the stroma. A patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) model of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) exhibits significantly higher quantitative uptake of [68Ga]FAPI-04 (P< 0.05) than [18F]FDG PET/CT in various organs. Because of relatively high (T/M) ratios, the [68Ga]FAPI-04 is excellent for B-mode ultrasound, NIRF, and PET/CT. Thus, [68Ga]FAPI-04 PET displayed a better tumor specificity and can be a potential application for the early detection of pancreatic cancer.
