Introduction:The role of paraaortic lymphadenectomy for cancer of the pancreatic head is controversial. The aim of this study is to analyze the prognostic role of paraaortic lymph node (PALN) metastases after resection for ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head.Materials and methods:A retrospective analysis of all patients, who underwent upfront resection for ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head at the Frankfurt University Hospital from 2011 to 2020 was performed. The primary endpoint was survival, according to the presence of PALN metastases.Results:Out of 468 patients with pancreatic resection, 148 had an upfront resection for ductal adenocarcinoma. Of those, in 125 (85%) a paraaortic lymphadenectomy was performed. In 19 (15.2%) PALN metastases were detected. The estimated overall median survival after resection was 21.7 months (95% CI 18.8 to 26.4), the disease free survival 16 months (95% CI 12 to 18). Among the patients with lymph node metastases, PALN metastases had no significant influence on overall (18.9 versus 19 months, HR = 1.3, 95% CI 0.7 to 2.6, p = 0.392) or disease free survival (14 versus 10.7 months, HR = 1.7, 95% CI 0.9 to 3.2, p = 0.076). After adjusting for T-stage, N-stage, grade, resection margin, PALN metastases, and adjuvant therapy, only adjuvant therapy had a prognostic significance for overall survival (HR = 0.47, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.85, p = 0.013).Conclusion:Patients with ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head and PALN metastases do not have inferior outcomes than those with regional lymph node metastases. Thus, positive PALN should not be considered a contraindication for resection.
