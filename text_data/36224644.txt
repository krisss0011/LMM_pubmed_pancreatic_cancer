Objective:The Norwegian pancreatic cancer disease impact score (PACADI) is a digitalized analogue questionnaire that assesses different disease-specific symptoms. There is a need of translations of it into other languages. Therefore, the aim of this article is to describe the translation process of a Swedish version of PACADI and present its validity to EORCT QLQ PAN26. The self-administered questionnaire PACADI was translated according to guidelines and assessed by an expert panel of health care personnel. The test of its validity was performed with the disease-specific questionnaire for EORCT QLQ PAN26. Both questionnaires were completed by 66 subjects with pancreatic cancer, either before, at discharge or three months after surgery.Result:The results between the groups indicate that patients suffer from different symptoms at different times. The correlations between the different symptoms of the two questionnaires were fair to good. In conclusion, PACADI and QLQ PAN 26 have a good correlation and PACADI can be used in clinical practise.
