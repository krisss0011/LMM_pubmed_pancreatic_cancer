This manuscript summarizes an excellent debate from the 2021 SSAT/Pancreas Club symposium on arterial resection in pancreas cancer. Two world-recognized experts, Professor Ugo Boggi from Pisa, IT, and Dr. Mark Truty from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, offered their views on the role of arterial resection in locally advanced pancreas ductal adenocarcinoma. Both speakers have extensive experience pushing the technical envelope with extended vascular resection in pancreatectomy. However, both highlight important concepts of resectability extending well beyond technique: namely, patient global physiology, tumor biology, and response to chemotherapy. The debate was spirited, and this subsequent review is an excellent look at the status quo. N. J. Zyromski, MD, Indianpolis, IN, November, 2021.
