Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a dreaded malignancy with a dismal 5-year survival rate despite maximal efforts on optimizing treatment strategies. Currently, early detection is considered to be the most effective way to improve survival as radical resection is the only potential cure. PDAC is often divided into four categories based on the extent of disease: resectable, borderline resectable, locally advanced, and metastatic. Unfortunately, the majority of patients are diagnosed with locally advanced or metastatic disease, which renders them ineligible for curative resection. This is mainly due to the lack of or vague symptoms while the disease is still localized, although appropriate utilization and prompt availability of adequate diagnostic tools is also critical given the aggressive nature of the disease. A cost-effective biomarker with high specificity and sensitivity allowing early detection of PDAC without the need for advanced or invasive methods is still not available. This leaves the diagnosis dependent on radiodiagnostic methods or endoscopic ultrasound. Here we summarize the latest epidemiological data, risk factors, clinical manifestation, and current diagnostic trends and implications of PDAC focusing on serum biomarkers and imaging modalities. Additionally, up-to-date management and therapeutic algorithms are outlined.
