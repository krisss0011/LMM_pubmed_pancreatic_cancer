Microbiota consists of a dynamic organization of bacteria, viruses, archaea, and fungal species involved in a number of vital functions spanning from the digestion of carbohydrates, vitamin synthesis, involvement in immune system to drug metabolism. More than 95 % of microbiota resides within the gut and it is essential for maintaining gut homeostasis. Dysregulation of gut microbiota contributes to the onset of several non-communicable diseases including cancer. Among the latter, pancreatic cancer is catching the attention of scientists around the globe being one of the most aggressive and resistant to therapies positioning the pancreatic cancer as one of the leading causes of death from cancer worldwide. In recent years, several studies have shown that the gut and tumor microbiota play a key role in the development, progression and prognosis of PDAC, mainly due to microbial ability to modulate host immune system and metabolize drugs. This review will focus on the new insights into the role of the microbiota as a new key player in pancreatic cancer PDAC development and prognosis by enlightening the microbial potential to interact with chemo/immunotherapeutic drugs and to modulate tumor microenvironment, thus impacting on cancer therapy success with the aim to pave the way to new integrative and interventional diagnostics or therapeutics approaches to prevent, diagnose and treat pancreatic cancer.
