Objectives:The aim of this study was to explore the diagnostic efficiency of serum exosomal miR-451a as a novel biomarker for pancreatic cancer.Methods:Serum samples were collected prior to treatment. First, we analyzed microRNA (miRNA) profiles in serum exosomes from eight pancreatic cancer patients and eight healthy volunteers. We then validated the usefulness of the selected exosomal miRNAs as biomarkers in another 191 pancreatic cancer patients, 95 pancreatic benign disease (PB) patients, and 90 healthy controls.Results:The expression of miR-451a in serum-derived exosomes from pancreatic cancer patients was significantly upregulated compared with those from PB patients and healthy individuals. Serum exosomal miR-451a showed excellent diagnostic power in identifying pancreatic cancer patients. In addition, exosomal miR-451a showed a significant association with clinical stage and distant metastasis in pancreatic cancer, and the expression level of serum exosomal miR-451a was sensitive to therapy and relapse.Conclusions:Serum exosomal miR-451a might serve as a novel diagnostic marker for pancreatic cancer.
