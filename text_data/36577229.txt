Introduction:Conflicting reports exist about the effect obesity has on adverse postoperative surgical outcomes after distal pancreatectomy (DP). The aim of this study is to explore the role of obesity in terms of morbidity and pancreas-specific complications following DP for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).Methods:All patients who underwent DP at a single institution over 10 y were analyzed (2009-2020). Patients were categorized as nonobese (body mass index [BMI] < 30 kg/m2) and obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2). Independent predictors of adverse postoperative outcomes were calculated using multivariate logistic regression models. Overall survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.Results:Of the 178 patients included, 58 (32.5%) were obese. Clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (CR-POPF) formation rate was significantly higher in the obese group (20.6% versus 7.5%, P value = 0.011). We did not identify any significant difference between obese and nonobese patients in median overall survival (30.2 mon versus 28.9 mon, P value = 0.811). On multivariate binary logistic regression analysis, BMI ≥ 30 was an independent predictor of morbidity (any complication) and CR-POPF formation after DP for PDAC.Conclusions:Obesity is associated with a significantly increased risk for CR-POPF in patients undergoing DP for PDAC. Obesity should be considered as a variable in fistula risk calculators for DP.
