Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common type of pancreatic cancer. Given its inconspicuous and atypical early symptoms and hidden location, most patients have already reached the terminal stage before diagnosis. At present, the diagnosis of PDAC mainly depends on serological and imaging examinations. However, serum tests cannot identify specific tumor locations and each imaging technology has its own defects, bringing great challenges to the early diagnosis of PDAC. Therefore, it is of great significance to find new strategies for the early and accurate diagnosis of PDAC. In recent years, a magneto-optical nanoplatform integrating near infrared fluorescence, photoacoustic, magnetic resonance imaging,etc. has attracted widespread attention, giving full play to the complementary advantages of each imaging modality. Herein, we summarize the recent advances of imaging modalities in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, and then discuss in detail the construction and modification of magneto or/and optical probes for multimodal imaging, and advances in early diagnosis using the combination of various imaging modalities, which can provide potential tools for the early diagnosis or even intraoperative navigation and post-treatment follow-up of PDAC patients.
