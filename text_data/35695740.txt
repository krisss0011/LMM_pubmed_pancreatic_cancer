Objectives:Germline genetic testing is universally recommended for patients with pancreatic cancer to guide therapeutic selection, but tumor molecular profiling (TMP) is not. We aimed to determine the real-world additional diagnostic benefit of TMP after germline testing for detecting therapeutically actionable alterations.Methods:Medical records and genetic test reports were reviewed for all patients who underwent germline testing and TMP at the University of California San Francisco during January 2016-January 2020. The detection rate of actionable alterations with germline testing alone was compared to that with both germline testing and TMP.Results:Among 738 eligible patients, 144 (20%) met study criteria. Germline testing detected 10 actionable alterations in 10 patients. Tumor molecular profiling identified 3 new therapeutic targets among these 10 patients and 45 targets in 41 additional patients, increasing the number of patients with actionable findings from 10 (7%) to 51 (35%). Most actionable alterations (35/58, 60%) involved genes associated with the Homologous Recombination DNA Damage Repair pathway.Conclusions:Tumor molecular profiling after germline testing increased the detection of actionable alterations by 5-fold. Tumor molecular profiling is a necessary complement to germline genetic testing to fully inform therapeutic decision making for all patients with pancreatic cancer.
