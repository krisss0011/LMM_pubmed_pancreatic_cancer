Objective:Stromal barriers, such as the abundant desmoplastic stroma that is characteristic of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), can block the delivery and decrease the tumour-penetrating ability of therapeutics such as tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), which can selectively induce cancer cell apoptosis. This study aimed to develop a TRAIL-based nanotherapy that not only eliminated the extracellular matrix barrier to increase TRAIL delivery into tumours but also blocked antiapoptotic mechanisms to overcome TRAIL resistance in PDAC.Design:Nitric oxide (NO) plays a role in preventing tissue desmoplasia and could thus be delivered to disrupt the stromal barrier and improve TRAIL delivery in PDAC. We applied anin vitro-in vivocombinatorial phage display technique to identify novel peptide ligands to target the desmoplastic stroma in both murine and human orthotopic PDAC. We then constructed a stroma-targeted nanogel modified with phage display-identified tumour stroma-targeting peptides to co-deliver NO and TRAIL to PDAC and examined the anticancer effect in three-dimensional spheroid culturesin vitroand in orthotopic PDAC modelsin vivo.Results:The delivery of NO to the PDAC tumour stroma resulted in reprogramming of activated pancreatic stellate cells, alleviation of tumour desmoplasia and downregulation of antiapoptotic BCL-2 protein expression, thereby facilitating tumour penetration by TRAIL and substantially enhancing the antitumour efficacy of TRAIL therapy.Conclusion:The co-delivery of TRAIL and NO by a stroma-targeted nanogel that remodels the fibrotic tumour microenvironment and suppresses tumour growth has the potential to be translated into a safe and promising treatment for PDAC.
