INTRODUCTION: Naples prognostic score (NPS) based on nutritional and 
inflammatory parameters can predict response to chemotherapy and overall 
survival (OS) in many cancer types. However, its significance in metastatic 
pancreatic cancer (PC) remains unclear. We evaluated the prognostic significance 
of the NPS in patients with metastatic PC receiving first line chemotherapy.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 215 patients with metastatic PC receiving 
first line FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy. NPS's were calculated using pre-chemotherapy 
laboratory data. Patients were divided into three groups according to their 
scores (NPS: 0; 1 & 2; 3 & 4 were grouped as 1, 2 and 3, respectively). The 
association of NPS with clinicopathological features and OS were evaluated.
RESULTS: Median age was 64 years, and median OS was 10.5 months. Hemoglobin 
levels were lower and Ca-19-9 values were higher with increasing NPS. Frequency 
of patients with bone and/or liver metastases, and with greater than 5 
metastatic focus were higher in group 3. A lower NPS was associated with longer 
OS. The median OS in groups 1, 2, and 3 were 19.5, 12, and 8 months, 
respectively, and differed significantly. Univariate analysis revealed effect of 
NPS (3-4) on OS (HR: 2.38, 1.77-3.19). Other prognostic factors affecting OS 
were age, ECOG, liver, bone or lymph node metastases, number of metastatic foci 
(<5 vs >5), de-novo metastatic disease, and serum Ca-19-9 levels. NPS (3-4) was 
identified as an independent prognostic factor negatively affecting OS (HR: 
1.89, 1.34-2.65) in multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSION: NPS may be a useful prognostic marker for the prediction of OS in 
metastatic PC patients receiving systemic chemotherapy.
