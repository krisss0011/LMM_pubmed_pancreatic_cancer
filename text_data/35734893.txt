Increasing evidence has demonstrated the important roles of exosomes during pancreatic cancer development. However, the effects of pancreatic cancer exosomes (PC-exos) on adipocytes remain largely unknown. Here, we used mass-spectrometry-based lipidomics to identify lipids that were changed in adipocytes after exposure to PC-exos, and we found that triglyceride (TG) reduction was the most significant, which might be induced by increased lipolysis because the number of large lipid droplets increased while small ones decreased. Additionally, abdominal adipocytes in mice injected with PC-exos had a relatively smaller size. Mechanistically, we found that genes involved in metabolism and inflammation were up-regulated, among which increase of IL-6 was significant, and we then found IL-6 promoted lipolysis. To our knowledge, this is the first study on the lipidomics changes of adipocytes after PC-exos treatment.
