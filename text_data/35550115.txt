Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is notorious for high mortality due to limited options of appropriate chemotherapy drugs. Here we report that Aurora kinase-A expression is elevated in both human and mouse PDAC samples. MLN8237, an inhibitor of Aurora kinase-A, efficiently reduced the proliferation and motility of PDAC cells in vitro as well as tumor growth in orthotropic xenograft model and genetic pancreatic cancer animal models (p53/LSL/Pdx-Cre mice) in vivo. MLN8237 exhibited tumor inhibitory effect through inhibiting proliferation and migration, and inducing apoptosis and senescence. These results provide the molecular basis for a novel chemotherapy strategy for PDAC patients.
