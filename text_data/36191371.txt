Objective:This study aimed to determine the role of COL17A1 in tumor progression and predict the prognosis of pancreatic cancer (PC).Methods:RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Genotype-Tissue Expression were analyzed using bioinformatics methods. "Limma" package was used to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Prognostic-associated data were further analyzed using univariate Cox regression and verified using the GSE28375 and GSE62452 datasets. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis was integrated to screen for hub genes. In vitro quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and western blotting were used to detect gene expression. The functional attributes of PC cells were verified by wound healing assays, migration and invasion assays, Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK8), and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay.Results:On analyzing PC data, 4637 DEGs were identified. Of these, 2399 genes were upregulated and 2238 were downregulated. Through PPI network analysis, we identified that COL17A1 expression was highly correlated with poor prognosis of patients with PC. Functional attribute assays in the in vitro study showed that COL17A1 knockdown inhibited PC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.Conclusions:According to our results, COL17A1 promotes PC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion mediated by the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway. Thus, COL17A1 could be used as a prognostic marker in PC.
