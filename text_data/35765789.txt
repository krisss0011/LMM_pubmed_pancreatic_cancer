All about the PancreasAbstract.Ultrasound has made tremendous progress with the use of contrast media and elastography, particularly in patients with small, solid pancreatic lesions (SPL) <20mm and cystic tumors (CPL) of any size. In the case of solid and cystic pancreatic lesions, the differential diagnosis must first be evaluated after detection in order to define the indications for radical surgery, strategies for preserving the pancreatic parenchyma or simply for control examinations. Contrast-enhanced transcutaneous (TUS, CEUS) and endoscopic (EUS, CE-EUS) ultrasound and elastography facilitate further characterization of SPL and ZPL. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC) show hypoenhancement in contrast-enhanced ultrasound. The majority of the important differential diagnoses, on the other hand, are multi-enhancing. PDAC are almost always harder than healthy pancreatic parenchyma. In contrast, elastographically soft SPL are - with very few exceptions - benign. This review provides an overview of the use of modern ultrasound techniques to detect and characterize solid and cystic pancreatic lesions.
