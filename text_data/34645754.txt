A 61-year-old man with a history of total gastrectomy for cancer with Roux-en-Y reconstruction showed severe postprandial hypoglycemia accompanied by endogenous hyperinsulinemia. Abdominal ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed no abnormal findings in the pancreas. A selective arterial secretagogue injection test showed the marked induction of serum immunoreactive insulin when calcium was injected into the splenic artery. A pathological analysis following distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy revealed a pancreatic neuroendocrine microadenoma containing insulin-producing cells in the resected pancreas. This case highlights the importance of carefully evaluating refractory and severe hypoglycemia in patients with a history of gastric surgery to exclude insulinoma.
