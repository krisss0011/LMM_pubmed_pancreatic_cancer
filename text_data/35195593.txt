Objectives:Resectability status is considered an important indicator for progression of pancreatic cancer. We verified the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) factors of resectability status by radiological and pathological analysis in patients who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy with combined resection of the SMA.Methods:We enrolled 22 patients who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy with combined resection of the SMA. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to the contact angle between the tumor and the SMA in preoperative computed tomography images (no contact, R-sma; contact within 180 degrees, BR-sma; contact more than 180 degrees, UR-sma). We pathologically evaluated cancer progression toward the SMA.Results:There were 3 patients with R-sma, 12 with BR-sma, and 7 with UR-sma. The median distance (mm) between the cancer and the SMA was 7.0 with R-sma, 1.0 with BR-sma, and 0 with UR-sma (P = 0.0003). Invasion to the superior mesenteric nerve plexus was positive in none with R-sma, 11 with BR-sma, and 7 with UR-sma (P < 0.0001). Invasion to the SMA was positive in none with R-sma and BR-sma, and 7 with UR-sma (P < 0.0001).Conclusions:Superior mesenteric artery factors of resectability status are reliable indicator for cancer progression toward the SMA.
