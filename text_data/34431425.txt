The growth of pancreatic cancer has a high predominance in the world. Different therapeutic methods were unsuccessful due to tumor invasion and rapid metastasis. Plants have natural products that were used as therapeutic agents. Accordingly, the purpose of this research was to assess the cytotoxic effect ofPortulaca Oleraceaagainst PANC-1 cancer cell line. MTT technique and flow cytometry were done to evaluate the cytotoxicity ofP.Oleraceaextracts against PANC-1 cancer cell line. For finding the change of CDK and P53 expression levels, qPCR carries out. The findings of the MTT assay exhibited thatP.Oleraceaextracts had toxicity potential on PANC- one cancer cell line. Also, the results of gene expression showed the high expression of P53 and reduction of CDK gene expression following treatment of cancer cells with plant extracts in. The flow cytometry assay showed apoptosis induced afterP.Oleraceaextract treatment in PANC- one cancer cell line. Also, microscopic observation is in agreement with flow cytometry and MTT assay. Results of the current study indicated thatP.Oleraceaextracts significantly induce apoptosis by regulating P53 and CDK expression, consequently. Therefore,P.Oleraceamay be considered as a novel finding for pancreatic cancer treatment consequently of its cytotoxic and apoptotic activity.
