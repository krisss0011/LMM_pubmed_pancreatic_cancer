Background and Objectives: Cancer patients are at increased short- and long-term risk of cardiac toxicity and mortality. It is well-known that cardiac morbidity and mortality follows a seasonal pattern. Here we address the question of whether heart disease-related fatalities among cancer patients also follow a seasonal pattern.Materials and Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of seasonality of deaths due to heart diseases (n= 503,243) in patients with newly diagnosed cancer reported during the period from 1975 to 2016 in the US's largest cancer registry-the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Seasonality was assessed through a classical cosinor model assuming a single annual peak.Results: We identified a significant seasonal peak in the first half of November. A peak with identical features was for all subgroups of patients defined based on demographic characteristics. This was also the case when analysis was performed on subgroups defined by the type of malignancy. Only patients with acute leukemias, pancreatic cancer and nervous system malignancies did not have a seasonal pattern in heart disease-related fatalities.Conclusion: the rate of heart disease-related fatalities after cancer diagnosis follows a seasonal pattern similar to that observed for the general population, albeit with an earlier peak in November. This suggests that close monitoring of the cardiovascular system in cancer survivors must be particularly active from late autumn and during the entire winter period.
