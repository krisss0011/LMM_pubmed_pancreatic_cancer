The patient was a 71-year-old man with the pancreatic cancer. He underwent subtotal stomach-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy and D2 lymphadenectomy. CT conducted 38 months after the surgery revealed the 10-mm mass at the lower lobe in the left lung. On PET-CT, the mass showed an abnormal uptake. We suspected that the mass was either a lung metastasis or a primary lung cancer. Partial resection of the left lung was performed, and pathological findings led to the diagnosis of lung metastasis originating from the primary pancreatic cancer. Currently at 9 years post-surgery, the patient has not had any recurrence of the metastasis. In this study, we report our case and discuss the literature.
