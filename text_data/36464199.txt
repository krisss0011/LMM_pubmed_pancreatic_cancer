The prevalence of obesity, diabetes mellitus (DM), and pancreatic cancer (PC) has been consistently increasing in the last two decades worldwide. Sharing various influential risk factors in genetics and environmental inducers in pathogenesis, the close correlations of these three diseases have been demonstrated in plenty of clinical studies using multiple parameters among different populations. On the contrary, most measures aimed to manage and treat obesity and DM effectively reduce the risk and prevent PC occurrence, yet certain drugs can inversely promote pancreatic carcinogenesis instead. Most importantly, an elevation of blood glucose with or without a reduction in body weight, along with other potential tools, may provide valuable clues for detecting PC at an early stage in patients with obesity and DM, favoring a timely intervention and prolonging survival. Herein, the epidemiological and etiological correlations among these three diseases and the supporting clinical evidence of their connections are first summarized to favor a better and more thorough understanding of obesity- and DM-related pancreatic carcinogenesis. After comparing the distinct impacts of different weight-lowering and anti-diabetic treatments on the risk of PC, the possible diagnostic implications of hyperglycemia and weight loss in PC screening are also addressed in detail.
