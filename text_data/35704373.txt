The incidence of pancreatic cancer (PC) in Spain has progressively increased over the past 6 decades. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma represents over 80 % of all pancreatic neoplasms. The study by Enrique Gili-Ortiz on pancreatic cancer-related mortality trends in Spain revealed a significant increase in death rates in our country, which may be partly attributed to population ageing and increased smoking, obesity, and diabetes rates. Other known factors, including chronic pancreatitis, seem to play a less significant role from a quantitative perspective.
