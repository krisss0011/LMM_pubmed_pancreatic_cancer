Purpose:Pancreatic cystic lesions (PCLs) include various types of cysts. Accurate preoperative diagnosis is essential to avoid unnecessary surgery on benign cysts. In this study, we aimed to identify the factors associated with misdiagnosis in preoperative endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) imaging and clinicopathological findings for PCLs.Methods:This study included 302 surgically resected patients with PCLs who underwent preoperative EUS. The preoperative EUS findings were re-evaluated and compared with the pathological diagnosis. Additionally, the factors associated with misdiagnosis of PCLs were investigated by multivariate analysis.Results:The preoperative diagnoses of PCLs were intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) in 213 patients (70.5%), mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN) in 33 patients (10.9%), serous neoplasm (SN) in 7 patients (2.3%), cystic degeneration cyst of solid tumor in 46 patients (15.2%), and pancreatic cancer with cystic degeneration in three patients (1.0%). A discrepancy between preoperative and postoperative diagnosis was found in 47 patients (15.6%). Based on the pathological diagnosis, the sensitivity of preoperative EUS imaging was IPMN 97.6% (206/211), MCN 90.0% (18/19), cystic degeneration 87.1% (27/31), and SN 15.4% (2/13). Multivariate analysis revealed that main pancreatic duct (MPD) communication ( - ) (odds ratio (OR), 4.54; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29-15.9), honeycomb-like structure ( +) (OR, 14.7; 95% CI 2.61-83.3), and MPD size â‰¦ 2 mm (OR, 16.3; 95% CI 3.93-67.6) were independently associated with misdiagnosis.Conclusion:For cases in which MCN and cystic degeneration of solid tumor are presumed based on preoperative EUS imaging and cases with PCLs with a honeycomb-like structure, diagnosis with multimodalities or fluid analysis with EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration should be considered.
