Purpose:There has been accumulating evidence for the preventive effect of high physical activity on cancer. However, it is still unclear which level of physical activity is associated with the decreased risk of pancreatic cancer. The purpose of current study is to assess the association between the frequency of vigorous intensity physical activity and the risk of pancreatic cancer.Materials and methods:The nationwide retrospective cohort study was conducted using the National Health Information Database. Study participants were 220,357 Koreans who received health check-up in 2009. They were divided into four groups by the weekly frequency of vigorous intensity physical activity longer than 20 minutes (group 1, no vigorous intensity physical activity (reference); group 2, 1-3 days; group 3, 4-5 days and group 4, 6-7 days). Cox proportional hazard model was used to calculate the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for incident pancreatic cancer (adjusted HRs [95% CI]) according to the weekly frequency of vigorous intensity physical activity.Results:For 4.38 years' follow-up on average, 377 cases of pancreatic cancer developed. Subjects without incident pancreatic cancer had more favorable metabolic condition and higher physical activity than subjects with incident pancreatic cancer. Adjusted HRs and 95% CI indicated that only group 4 was significantly associated with the decreased risk of pancreatic cancer (group 1, reference; group 2, 1.10 [0.86-1.40]; group 3, 0.75 [0.45-1.25] and group 4, 0.47 [0.25-0.89]).Conclusion:In this nationwide representative cohort study, near daily vigorous intensity physical activity showed the preventive effect on pancreatic cancer.
