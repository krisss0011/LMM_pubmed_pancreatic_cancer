Objective:This study aimed to investigate the effect of continuing nursing care team mode on postoperative outpatient chemotherapy patients with pancreatic cancer.Methods:One-hundred patients receiving postoperative outpatient chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer between September 2019 and December 2020 were enrolled in this study and divided into two groups, an intervention group and a control group (n = 50 each), by random number table method or coin tossing method. The patients in the intervention group were followed up using continuing nursing care team mode, while those in the control group were followed up using the traditional telephone follow-up mode. The effects of the two modes on patients' self-care ability, quality of life, anxiety, hospital waiting time, and the nurses' communication ability and self-efficacy were compared and analyzed.Results:The self-care ability and quality of life of the patients in the intervention group were better than those of the control group (p < 0.05), the anxiety score and hospital waiting times were lower than those in the control group (p < 0.05), and the communication ability and general self-efficacy of the nurses were also significantly stronger than those in the control group (p < 0.05).Conclusion:The application of the continuing nursing care team mode for follow-up can improve the self-care ability and quality of life of patients, effectively reduce the anxiety and hospital waiting time of outpatient chemotherapy patients, and improve the nurses' communication ability and general self-efficacy. Therefore, this practice is worthy of clinical popularization.
