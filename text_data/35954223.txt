The dysregulation of microRNAs has recently been associated with cancer development and progression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and cystic pancreatic lesions. In solid pancreatic tumor tissue, the dysregulation of miR-146, miR-196a/b, miR-198, miR-217, miR-409, and miR-490, as well as miR-1290 has been investigated in tumor biopsies of patients with PDAC and was reported to predict cancer presence. However, the value of the predictive biomarkers may further be increased during clinical conditions suggesting cancer development such as hyperinsulinemia or onset of diabetes. In this specific context, the dysregulation of miR-486 and miR-196 in tumors has been observed in the tumor tissue of PDAC patients with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus. Moreover, miR-1256 is dysregulated in pancreatic cancer, possibly due to the interaction with long non-coding RNA molecules that seem to affect cell-cycle control and diabetes manifestation in PDAC patients, and, thus, these three markers may be of special or "sentinel value". In blood samples, Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has also identified a set of microRNAs (miR-20a, miR-31-5p, miR-24, miR-25, miR-99a, miR-185, and miR-191) that seem to differentiate patients with pancreatic cancer remarkably from healthy controls, but limited data exist in this context regarding the prediction of cancer presences and outcomes. In contrast to solid pancreatic tumors, in cystic pancreatic cancer lesions, as well as premalignant lesions (such as intraductal papillary neoplasia (IPMN) or mucinous-cystic adenomatous cysts (MCAC)), the dysregulation of a completely different expression panel of miR-31-5p, miR-483-5p, miR-99a-5p, and miR-375 has been found to be of high clinical value in differentiating benign from malignant lesions. Interestingly, signal transduction pathways associated with miR-dysregulation seem to be entirely different in patients with pancreatic cysts when compared to PDAC. Overall, the determination of these different dysregulation "panels" in solid tumors, pancreatic cysts, obtained via fine-needle aspirate biopsies and/or in blood samples at the onset or during the treatment of pancreatic diseases, seems to be a reasonable candidate approach for predicting cancer presence, cancer development, and even therapy responses.
