Pancreatic colloid carcinoma, also known as mucinous non-cystic carcinoma, is a rare subtype of pancreatic cancer accounting for 1-3% of the pancreatic malignant neoplasms. We herein report a woman who initially presented for acute pancreatitis. Computed tomography showed pancreatic swelling due to acute pancreatitis and a 16-mm mass with an enhanced margin in the pancreatic tail. We performed endoscopic ultrasound fine-needle aspiration. The patient was diagnosed with pancreatic colloid carcinoma, and distal pancreatectomy was performed. This case indicates that pancreatic colloid carcinoma should be considered as a differential diagnosis of pancreatic tumor presenting with acute pancreatitis.
