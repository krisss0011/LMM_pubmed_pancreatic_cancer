Background:Cinobufacini, a sterilized hot water extract of dried toad skin, had significant effect against several human cancers. However, there are few studies reporting the effect of cinobufacini on pancreatic cancer.Purpose:To investigate the effects of cinobufacini on the progress of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and the underlying mechanisms.Methods:Cell counting, EdU incorporation and flow Cytometry were performed to evaluate the effect of cinobufacini on cell cycle and growth. MIA-PaCa2 cells were implanted into the nude mice to determine whether cinobufacini represses PDAC progression in vivo. Luciferase reporter assay, western blotting and qPCR were carried out to measure the activity of NF-κB pathway and the alteration of YEATS2 and TAK1. Ectopic gene expression introduced by plasmids was used to verify the molecular mechanism.Results:Our results showed that cinobufacini induced cell cycle arrest and inhibited the growth of PDAC cell in vitro, and repressed MIA-derived PDAC in vivo. Cinobufacini inhibited the phosphorylation of IKK, IκB and NF-κB p65 in PDAC cells. Furthermore, cinobufacini decreased the abundance of intracellular YEATS2 and total TAK1 protein in a time- and dose dependent manner. Ectopic expression of YEATS2 re-elevated the level of TAK1 and phosphorylated IKKα/β, IκBα and p65 after cinobufacini treatment in PANC-1 cells.Conclusion:Cinobufacini retards the growth and progression of PDAC in vitro and in vivo through YEATS2/TAK1/NF-κB axis.
