BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Racial and socioeconomic disparities in receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy affect patients with pancreatic cancer. However, differences in receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy among patients undergoing resection are not well-understood. A retrospective cross-sectional cohort of patients with resected AJCC Stage I/II pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma was identified from the National Cancer Database (2014-2017). Outcomes included receipt of neoadjuvant versus adjuvant chemotherapy, or receipt of either, defined as multimodality therapy and were assessed by univariate and multivariate analysis.Results:Of 19 588 patients, 5098 (26%) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 9624 (49.1%) received adjuvant chemotherapy only, and 4757 (24.3%) received no chemotherapy. On multivariable analysis, Black patients had lower odds of neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared to White patients (OR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.67-0.97) but no differences in receipt of multimodality therapy (OR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.77-1.03). Patients with Medicaid or no insurance, low educational attainment, or low median income had significantly lower odds of receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy or multimodality therapy.Conclusions:Racial and socioeconomic disparities persist in receipt of neoadjuvant and multimodality therapy in patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma.Discussion:Policy and interventional implementations are needed to bridge the continued socioeconomic and racial disparity gap in pancreatic cancer care.
