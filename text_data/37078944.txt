Objectives:New-onset diabetes mellitus has been shown to be associated with pancreatic cancer (PC) in the general population. Our objective was to leverage real-world data to assess the association of new-onset diabetes (NODM) with malignant transformation in a large longitudinal cohort of pancreatic cyst patients.Methods:A retrospective longitudinal cohort study was conducted using IBM's MarketScan claims databases from 2009 to 2017. From 200 million database subjects, we selected patients with newly diagnosed cysts without prior pancreatic pathology.Results:Of the 137,970 patients with a pancreatic cyst, 14,279 had a new diagnosis. Median follow-up was 41.6 months. Patients with NODM progressed to PC at nearly 3 times the rate of patients without a diabetes history (hazard ratio, 2.80; 95% confidence interval, 2.05-3.83) and at a significantly higher rate than patients with preexisting diabetes (hazard ratio, 1.59; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-2.21). The mean interval between NODM and cancer diagnosis was 7.5 months.Conclusions:Cyst patients who developed NODM progressed to PC at 3 times the rate of nondiabetics and at a greater rate than preexisting diabetics. The diagnosis of NODM preceded cancer detection by several months. These results support the inclusion of diabetes mellitus screening in cyst surveillance algorithms.
