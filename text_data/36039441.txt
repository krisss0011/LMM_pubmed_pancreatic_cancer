Background/aim:Understanding different surgical approaches and anatomical landmarks adjacent to the splenic artery (SpA) is important for safe robotic distal pancreatectomy (RDP). Herein, we propose our standardized RDP techniques, focusing on these issues.Patients and methods:Between April 2021 and April 2022, 19 patients who underwent RDP at our Institution were reviewed. Anatomical patterns of the SpA were classified into three types: Type 1, no pancreatic parenchyma on the root of the SpA; type 2, any pancreatic parenchyma on the root of the SpA; and type 3, dorsal pancreatic artery around the bifurcation of the common hepatic artery and SpA. Next, the surgical strategy for approaching the SPA was determined according to the location of the pancreatic transection line: On the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) or on the left side of the root of the SpA.Results:There were seven cases of type 1, nine cases of type 2, and three cases of type 3. When transecting the pancreas on the SMV, the SpA-first ligation technique was used for type 1 SpA anatomy, and the pancreas-first division technique was applied for types 2 and 3. In patients in whom the pancreas was transected at the left side of the root of the SpA, the SpA-first ligation technique was used.Conclusion:Our standardized surgical strategy based on anatomical landmarks and focusing on the approach to the SpA in RDP is demonstrated. Our strategy should help trainees approach the SpA and perform RDP safely.
