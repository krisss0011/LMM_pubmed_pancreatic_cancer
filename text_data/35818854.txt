Background and objective:The concept of neoadjuvant approach for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) has been evolving with the advancement in therapeutic modalities. In this narrative review, we aimed to discuss the updates and future perspectives on the treatment of LAPC.Methods:We discussed the recent literature and up-to-date evidence along with the future perspectives for the treatment of LAPC using the neoadjuvant approach. Reviewed literatures were searched by systematic search of PubMed and Google Scholar, including articles published in English between January 1st, 2013, and October 31st, 2021.Key content and findings:We aimed to review the efficacy outcomes of modern-era chemotherapy regimens and chemoradiation therapy for LAPC based on the results of up-to-date clinical trials and pivotal observational studies. Moreover, we aimed to discuss the role of conversion surgery and studies on the prediction of resectability after neoadjuvant therapy along with the necessity of adjuvant therapy for patients who have received neoadjuvant systemic treatments. Finally, we have addressed several unanswered questions regarding the optimal management of patients with LAPC and determined the future directions by introducing some ongoing trials.Conclusions:Current chemotherapy and chemoradiation therapy has improved clinical outcomes and the conversion surgery rate in patients with LAPC. Future randomized clinical trials and biomarker studies are needed to provide better evidence that can aid in the selection of optimal treatment modalities for individual patients.
