Objectives:Comorbid psychiatric illness has been associated with worse outcomes after some major surgical procedures. We hypothesized that patients with preexisting mood disorders would have worse postoperative and oncologic outcomes after pancreatic cancer resection.Methods:This retrospective cohort study analyzed Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results patients with resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma. A preexisting mood disorder was classified if a patient was diagnosed and/or treated with medication approved for depression/anxiety within 6 months before surgery.Results:Of 1305 patients, 16% had a preexisting mood disorder. Mood disorders had no impact on hospital length of stay (12.9 vs 13.2 days, P = 0.75), 30-day complications (26% vs 22%, P = 0.31), 30-day readmissions (26% vs 21%, P = 0.1), or mortality (30 days: 3% vs 4%, P = 0.35); only an increased 90-day readmissions rate (42% vs 31%, P = 0.001) was observed. No effect on adjuvant chemotherapy receipt (62.5% vs 69.2%, P = 0.06) or survival (24 months, 43% vs 39%, P = 0.44) was observed.Conclusions:Preexisting mood disorders influenced 90-day readmissions after pancreatic resection, but not other postoperative or oncologic outcomes. These findings suggest that affected patients should be expected to have outcomes similar to patients without mood disorders.
