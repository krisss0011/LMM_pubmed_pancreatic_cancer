Most available molecular data on pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma (PACC) are provided by studies of adult cases. BRAF, RAF1, or RET rearrangements have been described in approximately 30% of cases. To the best of our knowledge, only seven cases with molecular data have been reported in pediatric PACC. We report here the comprehensive study of a pancreatic-type ACC from a 6-year-old patient. We detected an AGAP3::BRAF fusion. This result showing a BRAF rearrangement demonstrates a molecular link between adult and pediatric PACC. Moreover, it identifies AGAP3, a gene located at 7q36.1 that encodes a major component of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor signaling complex, as a partner gene of BRAF. The variability of BRAF partners is consistent with a driver role of BRAF alterations in PACC. The identification of such alterations is noteworthy for considering the use of MEK inhibitors in metastatic cases. We did not detect associated genomic instability. The better outcome of pediatric cases might be related to their stable genomic background.
