Background/purpose:The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic impact of ABO blood type in resected pancreatic cancer (PC), with a focus on adjuvant chemotherapy.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed 510 patients who underwent pancreatectomy for PC between 2006 and 2017. Survival outcomes were investigated according to blood type and adjuvant chemotherapy regimen (S-1, gemcitabine, or no adjuvant chemotherapy).Results:Among the 510 patients, the overall survival (OS) of patients with blood type O was significantly better compared to those with blood type non-O (5-year OS rate, 46.6% vs 30.5%, P = .025). In 241 patients treated with adjuvant S-1, the 5-year OS of patients with blood type O was significantly better than those with blood type non-O (70.7% vs 44.2%, P = .001). Multivariate analysis showed that blood type non-O was an independent prognostic factor for OS in the overall cohort (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.58, P = .002) and in patients treated with adjuvant S-1 (HR: 2.99, P < .001). In patients treated with adjuvant gemcitabine or no adjuvant chemotherapy, there was no significant difference in OS between patients with blood type O and those with blood type non-O.Conclusions:Blood type O predicted favorable survival in patients with resected PC, which was associated with adjuvant S-1.
