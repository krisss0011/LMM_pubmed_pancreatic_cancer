Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm (IPMN) cysts are pre-malignant pancreas 
lesions, and they can progress into pancreatic cancer. Therefore, detecting and 
stratifying their risk level is of ultimate importance for effective treatment 
planning and disease control. However, this is a highly challenging task because 
of the diverse and irregular shape, texture, and size of the IPMN cysts as well 
as the pancreas. In this study, we propose a novel computer-aided diagnosis 
pipeline for IPMN risk classification from multi-contrast MRI scans. Our 
proposed analysis framework includes an efficient volumetric self-adapting 
segmentation strategy for pancreas delineation, followed by a newly designed 
deep learning-based classification scheme with a radiomics-based predictive 
approach. We test our proposed decision-fusion model in multi-center data sets 
of 246 multi-contrast MRI scans and obtain superior performance to the state of 
the art (SOTA) in this field. Our ablation studies demonstrate the significance 
of both radiomics and deep learning modules for achieving the new SOTA 
performance compared to international guidelines and published studies (81.9% vs 
61.3% in accuracy). Our findings have important implications for clinical 
decision-making. In a series of rigorous experiments on multi-center data sets 
(246 MRI scans from five centers), we achieved unprecedented performance (81.9% 
accuracy). The code is available upon publication.
