Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP), which is characterized by pancreatic enlargement and irregular narrowing of the main pancreatic duct, is difficult to differentiate from malignancy. The irregular narrowing of the pancreatic duct, which can be detected via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, is a characteristic feature of AIP; however, distinguishing between localized AIP and pancreatic cancer based on pancreatic duct imaging is difficult. This study overviews the efficacy of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided pancreatic sampling for the histopathological diagnosis of AIP. Recent enhancements in needle biopsy methodologies and technologies have contributed to improvement in the diagnostic efficacy of this technique. The guidance provided in this study for the histological diagnosis of AIP is anticipated to further advance in the histopathological diagnosis of AIP using EUS-guided pancreatic sampling.
