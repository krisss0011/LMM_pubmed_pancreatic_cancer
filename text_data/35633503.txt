Glycoproteins produced by tumor cells are involved in cancer progression, metastasis, and the immune response, and serve as possible therapeutic targets. Considering the dismal outcomes of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) due to its unique tumor microenvironment, which is characterized by low antitumor T-cell infiltration, we hypothesized that tumor-derived glycoproteins may serve as regulating the tumor microenvironment. We used glycoproteomics with tandem mass tag labeling to investigate the culture media of three human PDAC cell lines, and attempted to identify the key secreted proteins from PDAC cells. Among the identified glycoproteins, prosaposin (PSAP) was investigated for its functional contribution to PDAC progression. PSAP is highly expressed in various PDAC cell lines; however, knockdown of intrinsic PSAP expression did not affect the proliferation and migration capacities. Based on the immunohistochemistry of resected human PDAC tissues, high PSAP expression was associated with poor prognosis in patients with PDAC. Notably, tumors with high PSAP expression showed significantly lower CD8+T-cell infiltration than those with low PSAP expression. Furthermore, PSAP stimulation decreased the proportion of CD8+T cells in peripheral blood monocytes. Finally, in an orthotopic transplantation model, the number of CD8+T cells in the PSAP shRNA groups was significantly increased, resulting in a decreased tumor volume compared with that in the control shRNA group. PSAP suppresses CD8+T-cell infiltration, leading to the promotion of PDAC progression. However, further studies are warranted to determine whether this study contributes to the development of a novel immunomodulating therapy for PDAC.
