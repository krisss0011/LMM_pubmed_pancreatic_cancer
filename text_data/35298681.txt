Background:Standard pancreatic resections (SPRs) might have long-term deleterious effects on pancreatic function, without added oncological advantage in low malignant potential (LMP) or benign neoplasms. This study aimed to evaluate outcomes following organ-preserving pancreatic resections (OPPARs) and SPRs.Method:Post hoc analysis of patients undergoing OPPAR or SPR for benign or LMP pancreatic tumors from January 2011 to January 2020 at Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai.Results:Thirty-six and 114 patients were identified in OPPAR and SPR groups respectively. The overall morbidity (58.3% vs 43.9%, p-0.129) was comparable. Major morbidity (41.7% vs 21.9%, p-0.020), post-operative pancreatic fistula (POPF) (63.9% vs 35.1%, p-0.002), and clinically relevant POPF (41.7% vs 20.2%, p-0.010) were significantly higher with OPPAR. Post-operative endocrine insufficiency (14.9% vs 11.1%, p-0.567), exocrine insufficiency (19.3% vs 0%, p-0.004), and requirement of long-term pancreatic enzyme replacement (17.5% vs 0%, p-0.007) were higher in SPRs. Comparing left-sided and right-sided resections in the entire cohort, incidence of endocrine insufficiency was 17.1% vs 11.2% (p-0.299) and that of exocrine insufficiency was 8.6% vs 20% (p-0.048) respectively.Conclusion:OPPAR is associated with high post-operative major morbidity and pancreatic fistula rate but offers long-term benefit due to better preservation of pancreatic function than SPR. The incidence of exocrine insufficiency is higher in right sided as compared to left-sided pancreatic resections.
