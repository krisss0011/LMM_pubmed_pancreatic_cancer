Background & aims:Tumor-initiating cells (TICs) drive pancreatic cancer tumorigenesis, therapeutic resistance, and metastasis. However, TICs are highly plastic and heterogenous, which impede the robust identification and targeted therapy of such a population. The aim of this study is to identify the surface marker and therapeutic target for pancreatic TICs.Methods:We isolated voltage-gated calcium channel α2δ1 subunit (isoform 5)-positive subpopulation from pancreatic cancer cell lines and freshly resected primary tissues by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and evaluated their TIC properties by spheroid formation and tumorigenic assays. Coimmunoprecipitation was used to identify the direct substrate of CaMKⅡδ.Results:We demonstrate that the voltage-gated calcium channel α2δ1 subunit (isoform 5) marks a subpopulation of pancreatic TICs with the highest TIC frequency among the known pancreatic TIC markers tested. Furthermore, α2δ1 is functionally sufficient and indispensable to promote TIC properties by mediating Ca2+influx, which activates CaMKⅡδ to directly phosphorylate PKM2 at T454 that results in subsequent phosphorylation at Y105 to translocate into nucleus, enhancing the stem-like properties. Interestingly, blocking α2δ1 with its specific antibody has remarkably therapeutic effects on pancreatic cancer xenografts by reducing TICs.Conclusions:α2δ1 promotes pancreatic TIC properties through sequential phosphorylation of PKM2 mediated by CaMKⅡδ, and targeting α2δ1 provides a therapeutic strategy against TICs for pancreatic cancer.
