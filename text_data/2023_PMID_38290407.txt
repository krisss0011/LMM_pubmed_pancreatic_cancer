AIMS: Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly metastatic malignant tumor of the 
digestive system. Drug resistance frequently occurs during cancer treatment 
process. This study aimed to explore the link between chemoresistance and tumor 
metastasis in PC and its possible molecular and cellular mechanisms.
METHODS: A Metastasis and Chemoresistance Signature (MCS) scoring system was 
built and validated based on metastasis- and chemoresistance-related genes using 
gene expression data of PC, and the model was applied to single-cell RNA 
sequencing data. The influence of linker histone H1.2 (H1-2) on PC was explored 
through in vitro and in vivo experiments including proliferation, invasion, 
migration, drug sensitivity, rescue experiments and immunohistochemistry, 
emphasizing its regulation with c-MYC signaling pathway.
RESULTS: A novel MCS scoring system accurately predicted PC patient survival and 
was linked to chemoresistance and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in PC 
single-cell RNA sequencing data. H1-2 emerged as a significant prognostic 
factor, with its high expression indicating increased chemoresistance and EMT. 
This upregulation was mediated by c-MYC, which was also found to be highly 
expressed in PC tissues.
CONCLUSION: The MCS scoring system offers insights into PC chemoresistance and 
metastasis potential. Targeting H1-2 could enhance therapeutic strategies and 
improve PC patient outcomes.
