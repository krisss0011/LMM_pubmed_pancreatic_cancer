Endoscopic ultrasound-guided biliary drainage, mainly choledochoduodenostomy, is commonly used as rescue therapy after Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in malignant distal biliary obstruction due to un-resectable pancreatic cancer. An alternative when the cystic duct is patent and choledochoduodenostomy is not feasible is performing an Endoscopic Ultrasound-gallbladder drainage. The advent of the Lumen Apposing Metal Stents (LAMS) has shortened and simplified this procedure. However, many concerns exist about the performance of these procedures with metal stents preoperatively in resectable tumors. The evidence about Endoscopic Ultrasound-gallbladder drainage before surgery of pancreatic cancer is scarce. An emergent Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS)-gallbladder drainage (cholecysto-duodenostomy) was performed due to acute cholangitis in the setting of a resectable pancreatic tumor. Surgery after neoadjuvant therapy was done three months later. A complete resection of tumor was feasible. EUS-guided gallbladder drainage using LAMS does not preclude performing a complete resection of a pancreatic head tumor.
