Cancer cachexia is a metabolic disorder syndrome that causes skeletal muscle loss and progressive physical dysfunction, which is observed in more than half of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Cancer cachexia is considered to be associated with poor prognosis, worsening adverse events, decreased treatment compliance, and decreased treatment efficacy. The ghrelin receptor agonist leads skeletal muscle gain, weight gain, and the improvement of anorexia in patients with cancer cachexia, and has been approved as an anti-cachexia treatment in Japan. Cancer cachexia patients who present with cachexia symptoms such as appetite loss as well as weight loss are able to receive the treatment of the ghrelin receptor agonist, but the evidence for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer is limited. Further research is needed to evaluate the efficacy of the ghrelin receptor agonist for cancer cachexia in pancreatic cancer patients. Inhibition of inflammatory cytokine such as interleukin-1Î± and nutrition and exercise therapy are under development for anti-cachexia therapy.
