Objective:To analyze the survival outcomes and prognostic factors of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for pancreatic adenocarcinoma liver metastasis (PALM).Methods:Between January 2010 and July 2021, 20 patients (13 males) with an average age of 58.9 ± 11.7 years who underwent RFA for PALM were included. The mean maximum diameter of PALMs was 2.6 ± 1.1 cm (1.0-6.0 cm). Survival curves were built using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the log-rank test. Multivariable analyses were performed by using the Cox proportional hazards model.Results:Twenty patients with 29 PALMs underwent 23 RFA sessions. Technical efficacy was achieved in 28 PALMs (28/29, 96.6%). The mean overall survival (OS) after RFA was 14.6 months and the 1-, 2-year survival rates were 39.5%, 18.1%, respectively. With multivariate analysis, abnormal serum levels of CA199 (p= 0.023) and extrahepatic metastasis before RFA (p= 0.038) were identified as independent prognostic factors for OS in patients with PALM. Additionally, the mean progression-free survival (PFS) after RFA was 11.5 months and 1-, 2- year survival rates were 26.0%, 17.3%, respectively. With multivariate analysis, abnormal serum levels of CA199 (p= 0.016) and extrahepatic metastasis before RFA (p= 0.043) were also identified as independent prognostic factors for PFS in patients with PALM.Conclusion:RFA is a safe and effective treatment for patients with PALM, especially in patients with normal serum level of CA199 or the patients without extrahepatic metastases before RFA.
