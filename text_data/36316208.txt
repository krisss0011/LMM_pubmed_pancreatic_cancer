The case report is about a 68-years-old man who developed a weight loss and diabetes mellitus as early symptoms of pancreatic cancer several months before the diagnosis. Unfortunately, the diagnosis was made too late, at the stage of generalized disease, when symptomatic treatment was the only possible way. The aim of the article is to warn about this possible way of pancreatic cancer manifestation, because only the diagnosis determined in time, when the tumor is localized, allows its resection - the only curative treatment method. For this reason, it is necessary to consider the presence of pancreatic cancer in the case of an atypical manifestation of diabetes.
