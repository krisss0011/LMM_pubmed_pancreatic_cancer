The tumor microbiome is increasingly implicated in cancer progression and resistance to chemotherapy. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), high intratumoral loads ofFusobacterium nucleatumcorrelate with shorter survival in patients. Here, we investigated the potential mechanisms underlying this association. We found thatF. nucleatuminfection induced both normal pancreatic epithelial cells and PDAC cells to secrete increased amounts of the cytokines GM-CSF, CXCL1, IL-8, and MIP-3Î±. These cytokines increased proliferation, migration, and invasive cell motility in both infected and noninfected PDAC cells but not in noncancerous pancreatic epithelial cells, suggesting autocrine and paracrine signaling to PDAC cells. This phenomenon occurred in response toFusobacteriuminfection regardless of the strain and in the absence of immune and other stromal cells. Blocking GM-CSF signaling markedly limited proliferative gains after infection. Thus,F. nucleatuminfection in the pancreas elicits cytokine secretion from both normal and cancerous cells that promotes phenotypes in PDAC cells associated with tumor progression. The findings support the importance of exploring host-microbe interactions in pancreatic cancer to guide future therapeutic interventions.
