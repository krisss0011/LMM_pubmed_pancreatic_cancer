Introduction:Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest solid organ cancers. In the absence of specific warning symptoms pancreatic cancer is diagnosed notoriously late. Current systemic chemotherapy regimens extend survival by a mere few months. With the advances in genetic, proteomic, and immunological profiling there is strong rationale to test kinase inhibitors to improve outcome.Areas covered:This review article provides a comprehensive summary of approved treatments and past, present, and future developments of kinase inhibitors in pancreatic cancer. Emerging roles of protein kinase inhibitors are discussed in the context of the unique stroma, the lack of high-prevalence therapeutic targets and rapid emergence of acquired resistance, novel immuno-oncology kinase targets, and recent medicinal chemistry advances.Expert opinion:Due to the to-date frequent failure of protein kinase inhibitors indiscriminately administered to unselected pancreatic cancer patients, there is a shift toward the development of these agents in molecularly defined subgroups which are more likely to respond. The development of accurate biomarkers to select patients who are the best candidates based on a detailed understanding of mechanism of action, pro-survival roles, and mediation of resistance of targeted kinases will be critical for the future development of protein kinase inhibitors in this disease.
