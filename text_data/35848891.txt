The arachidonic acid cascade is a major inflammatory pathway that produces prostaglandin E2(PGE2). Although inhibition of 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) is reported to lead to PGE2 accumulation, the role of 15-PGDH expression in the tumor microenvironment remains unclear. We utilized Panc02 murine pancreatic cancer cells for orthotopic transplantation into wild-type and 15-pgdh+/-mice and found that 15-pgdh depletion in the tumor microenvironment leads to enhanced tumorigenesis accompanied by an increase in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and the promotion of fibrosis. The fibrotic tumor microenvironment is widely considered to be hypovascular; however, we found that the angiogenesis level is maintained in 15-pgdh+/-mice, and these changes were also observed in a genetically engineered PDAC mouse model. Further confirmation revealed that fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) is secreted by pancreatic cancer cells after PGE2 stimulation, consequently promoting CAF proliferation and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) expression in the tumor microenvironment. Finally, in 15-pgdh+/-Acta2-TK mice, depletion of fibroblasts inhibited angiogenesis and cancer cell viability in orthotopically transplanted tumors. These findings highlighted the role of 15-pgdh downregulation in enhancing PGE2 accumulation in the pancreatic tumor microenvironment and in subsequently maintaining the angiogenesis level in fibrotic tumors along with CAF expansion.
