Background:The overall survival for patients with resectable PDAC following curative surgical resection hasn't been improved significantly, as a considerable proportion of patients develop recurrence within a year. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a predictive model to assess recurrence risk in patients with PDAC after upfront surgery by using preoperative clinical data and CT characteristics.Methods:The predictive model was developed based on a retrospective set of 141 pancreatic cancer patients after surgery. A separate set of 77 patients was used to validate model. Between January 2017 and December 2019, all patients underwent multidetector pancreatic CT and upfront surgery. Univariable and multivariate Cox regression was used to determine the risk factors related to recurrence and then establish a nomogram to estimate the 1-year recurrence probability. The Harrell C-index was employed in evaluating the discrimination and calibration of the model.Results:A total of 218 patients in this retrospective cohort. A recurrence model in nomogram form was developed with predictors including tumor size (hazard ratio [HR], 1.277; 95% CI 1.098, 1.495; P = 0.002), tumor density in the portal vein phase (HR, 0.598; 95% CI 0.424, 0.844; P = 0.003), peripancreatic infiltration (HR, 4.151; 95% CI 2.077, 8.298; P < 0.001), suspicious metastatic lymph node (HR, 2.561; 95% CI 1.653, 3.967; P < 0.001), Neutrophils/Lymphocytes ratio (HR, 1.111; 95% CI 1.016, 1.215; P = 0.020). The predictive nomogram had good discrimination capability with these predictors with an area under curve at 1 year of 0.84 (95%CI 0.77, 0.91) in the development set and 0.82 (95% CI 0.72, 0.92) and 0.84 (95% CI 0.74, 0.94) in the validation set for two radiologists reading respectively.Conclusions:The model developed based on preoperative clinical data and CT characteristics of resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients, which can helpfully estimate the recurrence-free survival. It may be a useful tool for clinician to select optimal candidates for upfront surgery or neoadjuvant therapy.
