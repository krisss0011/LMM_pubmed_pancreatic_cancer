Purpose:The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and effectiveness of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) of the pancreatic body by assessing the overall survival of patients and evaluating the effects of the procedure in the clinical and radiological follow-up.Materials and methods:Patients with unresectable LAPC after failed chemoradiotherapy for at least six months were retrospectively included. Percutaneous RFA was performed after a preliminary ultrasound (US) feasibility evaluation. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and CA 19.9 sampling were performed before and 24 hours and 30 days after the procedure to evaluate the effects of the ablation. Patients were followed-up after discharge considering the two main endpoints: procedure-related complications and death.Results:35 patients were included, 5 were excluded. All patients underwent RFA with no procedure-related complications reported. The mean size of tumors was 49 mm before treatment. The mean dimension of the ablated necrotic zone was 32 mm, with a mean extension of 65 % compared to the whole tumor size. Tumor density was statistically reduced one day after the procedure (p < 0.001). The mean CA 19.9 levels before and 24 hours and 30 days after the procedure were 285.8 U/mL, 635.2 U/mL, and 336.0 U/mL, respectively, with a decrease or stability at the 30-day evaluation in 80 % of cases. The mean survival was 310 (65-718) days.Conclusion:Percutaneous RFA of LAPC is a feasible technique in patients who cannot undergo surgery, with great debulking effects and a very low complication rate.
