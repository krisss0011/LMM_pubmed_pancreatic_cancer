Kinesin family member 4A (KIF4A), located in the human chromosome band Xq13.1, is aberrantly overexpressed in various cancers. Our study intended to assess the expression of KIF4A in insulinoma and to gain new insights into the molecular mechanisms of this rare disease. First, KIF4A was significantly recruited in pancreatic endocrine cells relative to other cell types. A significant correlation existed between the overexpression of KIF4A and the poor survival of pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients. As revealed by CCK-8, TUNEL assay, flow cytometry, wound healing, Matrigel-transwell, senescence-associated Î²-galactosidase staining, ELISA, and subcutaneous tumor formation analysis in nude mice, knocking down KIF4A significantly inhibited the growth and metastasis of insulinoma cells in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, we observed that KIF4A promoter sequences had reduced H3K27me3 modifications, and decline in enhancer of zeste homolog-2 (EZH2) expression promoted KIF4A expression by reducing the modification, thus leading to insulinoma. Moreover, EZH2 knockdown-induced insulinoma cell proliferation was dependent on KIF4A overexpression since KIF4A knockdown eradicated shEZH2-induced proliferation of insulinoma cells. In summary, KIF4A was identified as a possible therapeutic target for insulinoma.
