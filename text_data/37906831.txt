Lipase hypersecretion syndrome (LHS) is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome, associated with acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas (ACCP) in 10% to 15% of patients. Clinically, LHS manifests itself with the appearance of subcutaneous fibrocystic nodules, associated with trophic changes in the overlying skin, such as ulcers or fistulas that are difficult to manage, mainly affecting the lower extremities. Additionally, lipolysis near the joints and in the intraosseous adipose tissue can cause bilateral arthralgias, especially of the knees and ankles. We report a 57-year-old man, with a history of insulin resistance and allergic rhinitis, who presented in June 2019 with multiple subcutaneous nodules in the lower extremities, predominantly in both ankles, associated with arthralgia in that region. Additionally, a CT scan of the abdomen revealed a significant abdominal mass, measuring approximately 17 cm and in contact with the body and tail of the pancreas, pathologically compatible with an ACCP. Treatment with capecitabine was started with a favorable progression. The patient currently presents a small left lateral retro malleolar fistula, which, given the analyzes, studies and reviewed literature is concluded to be a lesion in the context of LHS.
