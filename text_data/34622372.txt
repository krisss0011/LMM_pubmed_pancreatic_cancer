Objective:The aim of this study was to clarify the minimum number of examined lymph nodes (MNELNs) required to ensure the quality of lymph node detection and its impact on long-term survival in distal pancreatectomy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.Methods:Clinicopathological characteristics and survival data of patients with resectable pancreatic cancer who underwent distal pancreatectomy between 2004 and 2017 were collected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. The associations between the number of examined lymph nodes (ELNs) and number of positive lymph nodes (PLNs), stage migration, and overall survival were investigated through adjusted multivariate models with locally weighted scatterplot smoothing smoothing fitting curves and estimation of the structural breakpoints. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and X-tile software were used to identify the ideal cut-off value for ELNs.Results:In total, 2610 consecutive patients who underwent distal pancreatectomy between 2004 and 2017 were included in this study. The optimal ELN count according to the associations between the number of ELNs and number of PLNs, odds ratio for stage migration, or hazard ratio for overall survival were 19, 17, and 19, respectively. Furthermore, the optimal division of ELN count for maximum overall survival was divided into three populations (ELN ≤ 8, ELN 9-18, ELN ≥ 19) based on X-tile software.Conclusion:A minimal count of 19 lymph nodes was demanded to guarantee the quality of lymph node examination in patients with distal pancreatectomy. Long-term survival could be delimited by MNELNs. A sufficient number of ELNs could improve the accuracy of cancer staging and reflect a better overall survival.
