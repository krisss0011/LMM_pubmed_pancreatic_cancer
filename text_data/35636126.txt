A highly efficient domino [4 + 2] annulation process was employed to construct a novel indolizine chemical scaffold. Biological investigation led us to identify 6w as a potent anticancer agent. 6w significantly inhibited cell viability in BxPC3 pancreatic cancer, MCF7 breast cancer, and PC3 prostate cancer cell lines with IC50values of 0.47 ± 0.04, 1.82 ± 0.08 and 2.68 ± 0.08 µM, respectively. Remarkably, 6w showed a weak effect on cell viability of nontumorigenic human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT compared to the above three types of cancer cells. 6w most potently inhibited cell viability of BxPC3 cells, and 6w also potently reduced cell migration and induced apoptosis in BxPC3 cells through activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that 6w can be used for the development of potential anticancer drugs for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
