Objective:To determine the frequency of depression or anxiety preceding a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer (PC). Further, to examine the association of PC-associated depression or anxiety with treatment compliance and survival.Methods:856 patients with PC from a single institution were identified using International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes. For each case, two non-cancer age- and sex-matched controls were included. Dates of depression or anxiety diagnosis identified using ICD codes were compared to the date of PC diagnosis. The medical record was queried to further explore psychiatric symptoms. Multivariable analyses were performed to examine if prediagnosis depression or anxiety was associated with receipt of treatment or survival.Results:A greater proportion of patients with PC experienced depression or anxiety in the year preceding diagnosis than the overall frequency in controls (4.6% vs. 2.6%, p = 0.005) based on ICD codes. Patients with PC exhibited signs of prodromal depression or anxiety based on ICD codes, clinical documentation of psychiatric symptoms, or initiation of new psychiatric medications more often than controls (20.7% vs. 6.7%, p < 0.001). Prediagnosis depression or anxiety was associated with a reduced likelihood of receiving chemotherapy (OR = 0.58, p = 0.04). There was an associated decrease in overall survival among patients with metastatic disease who experienced depression or anxiety before PC diagnosis (HR = 1.32, p = 0.04).Conclusions:The frequency of depression or anxiety among patients with PC was higher than the general population. Prediagnosis psychiatric symptoms were associated with reduced chemotherapy utilization and worse overall survival. Thus, timely identification and treatment of these symptoms may improve outcomes.
