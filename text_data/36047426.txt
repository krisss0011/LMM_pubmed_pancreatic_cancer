Aim:Contrast-enhanced harmonic endoscopic ultrasound (CEH-EUS) parameters may be used to predict prognosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET). The aim of this study was to investigate the association between several perfusion parameters on CEH-EUS performed before treatment and survival outcome in patients with PDAC or pNET.Material and methods:Thirty patients with PDAC or pNET who underwent CEH-EUS and EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) were included. Quantitative analysis of tumor vascularity was performed using time-intensity curve (TIC) analysis-derived parameters, obtained from processing CEH-EUS recordings with a commercially available software (VueBox). Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine associations with survival outcome.Results:Median overall survival (OS) for PDAC patients was 9.61 months (95% CI: 0.1-38.7) while the median OS for pNET patients was 15.81 months (95% CI: 5.8-24.75. In a multivariate model for OS, a lower peak enhancement (HR=1.76, p=0.02) and a lower wash-in area under the curve (HR=1.06, p=0.001) were associated with worse survival outcome for patients with PDAC.Conclusions:CEH-EUS parameters may be used as a surrogate to predict PDAC aggressiveness and survival before treatment. After validation by large-scale studies, CEH-EUS perfusion parameters have the potential to be used in pretreatment risk stratification of patients with PDAC and in evidence-based clinical decision support.
