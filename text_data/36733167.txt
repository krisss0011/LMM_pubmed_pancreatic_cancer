We hereby report a case in which a patient with multiple lung metastases of pancreatic cancer continued chemotherapy and maintained good performance status(PS)for 48 months after recurrence. But her disease progressed rapidly after withdrawal of chemotherapy, resulting in her death in a short period of time. The patient was a 66-year-old woman who underwent a substomach preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic head cancer at the age of 60 years. She was diagnosed as fT3N1M0, fStage â…¡B. During postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy S-1, multiple lung metastases were noted on CT scan 2 years after surgery. Thereafter, she was treated with gemcitabine(GEM)alone, GEM plus nab-paclitaxel(GnP), nal-CPT-11 plus 5-FU plus Leucovorin, and FOLFIRINOX for 48 months sequentially. Each of which achieved a best overall response SD or better. However, Trousseau syndrome developed following community-acquired pneumonia during chemotherapy withdrawal due to myelosuppression. The disease progressed rapidly and resulted in her death 50 months after relapse. The results suggest that chemotherapy may have contributed significantly to disease control in this case.
