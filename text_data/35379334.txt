Background:Pancreatic cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer mortality and one of the most lethal malignant neoplasms worldwide. It is known for its local tumor extension to the liver; other common sites include the lung, distant lymph nodes, and bone. Brain metastases are extremely rare and represent less than 0.6% of all brain metastases.Case report:We report the case of a 66-year-old Caucasian female known to have adenocarcinoma of the tail of the pancreas treated with chemotherapy. During follow-up, thoracoabdominal computed tomography scans did not reveal any residual tumor or any metastasis. Moreover, tumor markers were within normal limits. She presented to the emergency department of our institution following an episode of a generalized tonic-clonic seizure 5 years following the initial diagnosis. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed an expansive left frontal intraaxial lesion compatible with high-grade glioma. The patient underwent surgical treatment. Histological examination revealed pancreatic metastasis.Conclusions:Thought to be rare, metachronous cerebral pancreatic metastasis should be kept in mind in patients with pancreatic cancer. Early diagnosis and complete surgical resection play a key role in the survival of these patients.
