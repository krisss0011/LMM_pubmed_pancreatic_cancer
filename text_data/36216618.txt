Background:The purpose of this study was to evaluate the rates of local recurrence and margin positivity in patients with borderline resectable pancreatic cancer after pancreatectomy with or without irreversible electroporation with margin accentuation.Methods:Prospective data for preoperative stages IIB (borderline resectable) and III were evaluated, with 75 patients undergoing pancreatectomy with irreversible electroporation with margin accentuation compared to 71 patients who underwent pancreatectomy alone from March 2010 to November 2020.Results:Both irreversible electroporation with margin accentuation and pancreatectomy-alone groups were similar for body mass index, Charleston comorbidity index, and sex. The irreversible electroporation with margin accentuation group had significantly greater preoperative stage III (irreversible electroporation 83% vs pancreatectomy alone 51%; P = .0001), with similar tumor location (head 64% vs 72%) and tumor size (median 2.9 vs 2.8). Neoadjuvant/induction chemotherapy and prior radiation therapy was similar in both groups (irreversible electroporation with margin accentuation 89% vs 72%). Surgical therapy included a greater percentage of pancreaticoduodenectomy in the pancreatectomy-alone group. Despite greater stage and greater percentage of margin positivity (irreversible electroporation with margin accentuation 27% vs 20%; P = not significant), rates of local recurrence were similar. The mean disease-free interval for local recurrence from time of diagnosis was similar (irreversible electroporation with margin accentuation 15.8 vs 16.5 pancreatectomy alone; P = not significant) and time of treatment (irreversible electroporation with margin accentuation 9.4 vs 10.5 months; P = not significant). Overall survival was improved with the irreversible electroporation with margin accentuation group, with a mean of 34.2 months versus 27.9 months in the pancreatectomy-alone group.Conclusion:Irreversible electroporation with margin accentuation is safe and effective in stages IIB and III pancreatic adenocarcinomas that are technically resectable. Despite higher margin positivity rates, the time to local recurrence and the effects of recurrence were the same in the pancreatectomy-alone group.
