Celastrol is a promising antitumor drug candidate, but the poor water solubility and cytotoxicity limit its clinical application. Herein, we synthesized a Celastrol (Cel)-chitosan oligosaccharide (CSO) conjugate (Cel-CSO) for drug delivery. Celastrol was conjugated to a CSO backbone via amide bond formation, which was verified by infrared spectrum (IR) analyses. The Cel-CSO contained âˆ¼10 wt% of Celastrol showed excellent aqueous solubility (18.6 mg/mL) in comparation with the parent Celastrol. Cel-CSO significantly inhibited tumor growth, induced apoptosis, and effectively suppressed tumor metastasis in human pancreatic cancer cells (BxPC-3). While the cytotoxicity of Cel-CSO in hepatic cells (HL7702) was lower than that of the free Celastrol. Cel-CSO enhanced the anticancer efficacy, promoted the circulation time of Celastrol, and reduced the subacute toxicity, which indicated that CSO can be a promising Celastrol delivery system for pancreatic cancer therapy.
