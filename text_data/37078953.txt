Objectives:To evaluate the efficacy and safety of cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cell therapy in pancreatic cancer.Methods:An orthotopic murine model of pancreatic cancer and adjuvant therapy-mimicking xenograft murine model that underwent splenectomy was created. Eighty mice were randomized into four groups: the control, gemcitabine alone, CIK alone, and CIK with gemcitabine groups. The tumor growth was monitored using bioluminescence imaging once weekly.Results:In the orthotopic murine model, the treatment groups showed a significantly longer survival than the control group (median: not reached vs 125.0 days; 95% confidence interval, 119.87-130.13; P = 0.04); however, the overall survival did not differ significantly among the treatment groups (P = 0.779). The metastatic recurrence rate and overall survival were also not significantly different among the groups in the adjuvant therapy-mimicking xenograft murine model (P = 0.497). However, the CIK and gemcitabine combination suppressed the metastatic recurrence effectively, with recurrence-free survival being significantly longer in the CIK with gemcitabine group than in the control group (median, 54 days; 95% confidence interval, 25.00-102.00; P = 0.013).Conclusions:The combination of CIK and gemcitabine suppressed systemic metastatic recurrence, with promising efficacy and good tolerability in an adjuvant setting of pancreatic cancer.
