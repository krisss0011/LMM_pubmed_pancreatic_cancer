Introduction:Exercise can lower the risk of developing pancreatic cancer and has the potential to improve physical fitness and quality of life in patients with the disease. Yet, the effects of exercise training during pancreatic cancer treatment remain poorly characterized. This hampers the development of evidence-based disease-specific exercise recommendations.Purpose:The purpose of this review was to describe and interpret the effect of exercise on physiological, QoL, and cancer-specific outcomes reported in clinical trials among pancreatic cancer patients during treatment.Methods:We conducted a scoping review of the literature according to the framework proposed by Arksey and O'Malley. Articles published prior to December 2021 were retrieved from PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus. We only included studies that prescribed structured cardiorespiratory and/or resistance exercise in pancreatic cancer patients undergoing treatment.Results:A total of 662 references were retrieved, of which 24 are included in the review. Twelve articles were randomized controlled trials and 12 were single-arm trials. Overlap in the trials from which data were reported occurred in 16 articles. Moderate intensity exercise was most commonly prescribed, reported feasible for most patients, with potential to enhance physical fitness and QoL. However, exercise adherence and beneficial effects may diminish with disease progression. Limited evidence suggests exercise may benefit cancer-specific outcomes.Conclusion:The results of this review indicate that exercise is feasible during pancreatic cancer treatment. Exercise can also improve physical fitness and QoL. However, its beneficial effects may fall with advanced disease and more rigorous research is needed to develop precise exercise protocols for this population.
