Distal pancreatectomy with En-bloc celiac axis resection (DP-CAR) is a challenging procedure that has yielded certain clinical efficacy in the treatment of locally advanced pancreatic body/tail cancer, especially in patients with invasion of abdominal vessels. However, the clinical efficacy and safety of DP-CAR remain controversial. The study aimed to systematically review efficacy and safety of DP-CAR in the treatment of locally advanced pancreatic body/tail cancer. We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases from inception to 1 October 2020. Two studiers independently accomplished the study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment. Initially, of 1032 studies were searched, among which 11 high quality studies including 1072 patients were finally identified. The pooled results showed that DP-CAR versus Distal pancreatectomy (DP), the rate of R0 resection (RR = 0.76; 95%CI: 0.66 to 0.88; p = 0.0002) and 3-year survival (RR = 0.65; 95%CI: 0.43 to 0.98; p = 0.04) was lower, postoperative mortality (RR = 2.48; 95%CI: 1.02 to 6.03; p = 0.04) was higher, the operation time (MD = 104.67; 95%CI: 84.70 to 124.64; p < 0.001) and hospital stay (MD = 3.94, 95% CI 1.35 to 6.53; p = 0.003) were longer. There was no statistical difference between the DP-CAR and DP group in 1-year, 2-year survival rate (RR = 0.84; 95%CI: 0.57 to 1.23; p = 0.37) (RR = 0.70; 95%CI: 0.45 to 1.10; p = 0.12). In conclusion, compared with DP, DP-CAR has worse efficacy and prognosis survival and is more dangerous, but it can obtain better survival benefit and quality of life than palliative treatment. We suggest that DP-CAR can be carefully attempted for effective margin-negative resection. However, surgeons and patients need to know its potential perioperative risk.
