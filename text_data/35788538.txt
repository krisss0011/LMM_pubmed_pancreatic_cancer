Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) affecting the pancreas are a heterogeneous group of side effects that cause damage to pancreatic cells. Various mechanisms such as hypersensitization, sphincter of Oddi constriction, direct cytotoxic and metabolic effects on pancreatic cells, and dose-dependent idiosyncrasy lead to intrapancreatic activation of pancreatic enzymes resulting in drug-induced acute pancreatitis. Several medications have been linked with the development of pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer may result from proinflammatory, proliferative, and antiapoptotic effects. Diabetogenic effect of drugs, which is understood as impairment of insulin secretion, may occur due to direct destruction of β cells, systemic toxicity affecting pancreatic islets and cell membrane glucose transporters, induction of Th1-type autoimmune response, and impairment of voltage-gated calcium channels in β cells, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and insulin signaling. A better understanding of ADRs that affect the pancreas may contribute to improving the awareness of clinicians and patients and reducing potential harmful side effects of implemented therapies.
