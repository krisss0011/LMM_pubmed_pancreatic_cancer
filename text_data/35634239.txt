Background:Although HOXB9 induces tumor proliferation and chemoresistance in several cancer cells, little is known in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In the present study, increased expression of HOXB9 in PDAC was associated with the induction of angiogenic factors and poor overall survival through the TGFβ pathway. Taken together, these results suggested that HOXB9 expression in PDAC could be a surrogate marker in clinical treatment.Methods:In vitro, angiogenic factors, TGFβ signature, Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) marker, and chemoresistance were examined in PDAC cell lines by HOXB9 knockdown system. And the reverse effect was confirmed by using TGFβ1 recombinant. Furthermore, in clinical specimens, the correlation between HOXB9 expression and TGFβ signature was analyzed, and the relationship with clinical outcomes were investigated.Results:HOXB9 expression regulated the expression of TGFβ1 signature, angiogenic factors, and EMT markersin vitro, and TGFβ1 recombinant made the reverse effect of these results. And HOXB9 expression regulated the resistance to chemotherapy (Gemcitabine and nab-Paclitaxel) and stem cell population. Moreover, increased HOXB9 expression was significantly associated with poor disease-free survival the prognosis for overall survival. And, a significant positive correlation was observed between HOXB9 expression and several TGFβ signatures in clinical specimens.Conclusions:In conclusion, HOXB9 expression could mediate angiogenesis, EMT, and cancer stemness through the TGFβ pathway, thereby resulting in chemoresistance and poor overall outcomes in patients with pancreatic cancer. Our results suggested that HOXB9 may clinically serve as a novel surrogate biomarker.
