Background:Although a substantial increase in the survival of patients with other cancers has been observed in recent decades, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the deadliest diseases. No effective screening approach exists.Methods:Differential exosomal long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) isolated from the serum of patients with PDAC and healthy individuals were profiled to screen for potential markers in liquid biopsies. The functions of LINC00623 in PDAC cell proliferation, migration and invasion were confirmed through in vivo and in vitro assays. RNA pulldown, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays and rescue experiments were performed to explore the molecular mechanisms of the LINC00623/NAT10 signaling axis in PDAC progression.Results:A novel lncRNA, LINC00623, was identified, and its diagnostic value was confirmed, as it could discriminate patients with PDAC from patients with benign pancreatic neoplasms and healthy individuals. Moreover, LINC00623 was shown to promote the tumorigenicity and migratory capacity of PDAC cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, LINC00623 bound to N-acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10) and blocked its ubiquitination-dependent degradation by recruiting the deubiquitinase USP39. As a key regulator of N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C) modification of mRNA, NAT10 was demonstrated to maintain the stability of oncogenic mRNAs and promote their translation efficiency through ac4C modification.Conclusions:Our data revealed the role of LINC00623/NAT10 signaling axis in PDAC progression, showing that it is a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for PDAC.
