Mucinous cystadenocarcinoma (MCAC) with malignant ascites is rare. We report a case of a 28-year-old woman who presented with epigastric pain. The ascites in the Douglas fossa was identified at a nearby gynecology clinic. Computed tomography showed a multiloculated cystic lesion (9.5 Ã— 6.4 cm) in the tail of the pancreas, which was diagnosed as mucinous cystic neoplasm on imaging. Staging laparoscopy was performed, and rapid cytology of ascites revealed adenocarcinoma, leading to a diagnosis of unresectable MCAC. Subsequently, combination chemotherapy with gemcitabine plus S-1 was initiated. Although there were no remarkable changes in the imaging findings, the peritoneal dissemination node was not consistently recognized in any of the imaging findings, and distal pancreatectomy was performed. A peritoneal dissemination node was not observed in the laparotomy findings, but the peritoneal lavage cytology was positive. The postoperative pathological result was non-invasive MCAC, and the ascites was suspected to be caused by cyst rupture. The patient has been recurrence-free, including the reappearance of ascites, for > 8 years after adjuvant therapy with S-1. Although careful follow-up will be required in the future, the very good prognosis in this case suggests that MCAC with malignant ascites without obvious peritoneal dissemination should be considered for surgical resection.
