Interactions between different cell types in the tumor microenvironment (TME) affect tumor growth. Tumor-associated fibroblasts produce C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 13 (CXCL13) which recruits B cells to the TME. B-cells in the TME differentiate into regulatory B cells (Bregs) (IL-10+CD1d+CD5+CD138+CD19+). We highlight these Breg cells as a new important factor in the modulation of the immunosuppressive TME in different desmoplastic murine tumor models. In addition, CXCL13 also stimulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of the tumor cells. The tumorigenic roles of CXCL13 led us to explore an innovative anti-cancer strategy based on delivering plasmid DNA encoding a CXCL13 trap to reduce Bregs differentiation and normalize EMT, thereby suppressing tumor growth. CXCL13 trap suppressed tumor growth in pancreatic cancer, BRAF-mutant melanoma, and triple-negative breast cancer. In this study, following treatment, the affected tumor remained dormant resulting in prolonged progression-free survival of the host.
