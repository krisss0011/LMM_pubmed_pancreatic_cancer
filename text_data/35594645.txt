Background:Centralisation of cancer surgery is a commonly applied healthcare strategy worldwide. This study aimed to detail the design of centralisation policies, to shed light on the implications of such policies in real practice and to describe the different perspectives taken to deal with difficulties that emerged, taking pancreatic cancer as an example of a complex cancer disease requiring surgery.Methodology:A scoping review was conducted using the MEDLINE database. We systematically searched for eligible studies published between January 2000 and December 2018.Results:In the 33 included studies, centralisation of pancreatic cancer surgery was implemented through three different models: designated hospitals, definition of minimum volumes per provider, and/or recommendations included in protocols and national guidelines. The presence of highly advanced technology and infrastructures, the availability of extensive service coverage and advanced care processes based on expert multidisciplinary teams, and higher caseloads were identified as key components of centralisation policy.Conclusions:Centralisation models for pancreatic cancer surgery showed that having expert centres where the care process is comprehensively guided is a foundational policy approach. External quality assessment and the accreditation of centres and professionals performing complex surgical procedures are levers that may positively impact the effectiveness of the measure. POLICY SUMMARY: while we found different experiences and three models of centralisation, all of them were guided by the will to positively impact on pancreatic cancer patients' access to expert care. Clinical research might be able to make progress in the coming years and perhaps contribute to reversing a critical situation of high mortality and growing incidence. However, policymakers must optimise health system responses considering current resources, as suggested by the recommendations proposed in the framework of the EU initiative Bratislava Statement for pancreatic cancer care.
