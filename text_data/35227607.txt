Purpose:Pancreatic cancer (PC) risk is increased in families, but PC risk and risk perception have been understudied when both parents have cancer.Methods:An unbiased method defining cancer triads (proband with PC and both parents with cancer) in a prospective registry estimated risk of PC to probands' siblings in triad group 1 (no parent with PC), group 2 (1 parent with PC), and group 3 (both parents with PC). We estimated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) using a Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) reference. We also estimated the risk when triad probands carried germline pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in any of the 6 PC-associated genes (ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CDKN2A, MLH1, and TP53). PC risk perception/concern was surveyed in siblings and controls.Results:Risk of PC was higher (SIR = 3.5; 95% CI = 2.2-5.2) in 933 at-risk siblings from 297 triads. Risk increased by triad group: 2.8 (95% CI = 1.5-4.5); 4.5 (95% CI = 1.6-9.7); and 21.2 (95% CI = 4.3-62.0). SIR in variant-negative triads was 3.0 (95% CI = 1.6-5.0), whereas SIR in variant-positive triads was 10.0 (95% CI = 3.2-23.4). Siblings' perceived risk/concern of developing PC increased by triad group.Conclusion:Sibling risks were 2.8- to 21.2-fold higher than that of the general population. Positive variant status increased the risk in triads. Increasing number of PC cases in a triad was associated with increased concern and perceived PC risk.
