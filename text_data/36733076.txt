A 73-year-old man underwent distal pancreatectomy for invasive pancreatic ductal carcinoma in 2018. He showed stenosis of sigmoid colon due to recurrence of pancreatic cancer and received transverse colostomy in 2020. One year after initiation of gemcitabine monotherapy, he complained of abdominal pain. CT images and colonoscopy revealed accumulation of mucus in sigmoid colon due to stenotic lesions. Because conservative treatment using antibiotics was not effective, we performed sigmoidectomy. Histological examination revealed that tubular adenocarcinoma located mainly in the muscularis propria invaded into the colonic mucosa. Immunohistochemical analysis showed positive staining for CK7, and negative for CK20. We diagnosed sigmoid colon metastases of pancreatic cancer.
