Background/objectives:Sarcopenia in pancreatic cancer may increase the risk of chemotherapy-related toxicity and post-operative morbidity. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to quantify the prevalence of sarcopenia in early stage pancreatic cancer.Methods:Relevant studies were identified using Ovid Medline and Elsevier Embase. Pooled estimates of prevalence rates (percentages) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were computed using a random-effects model to allow for heterogeneity between studies.Results:The majority of the 33 studies (n = 5,593 patients) included in this meta-analysis utilized computed tomography (CT)-derived measures for body composition assessment in patients undergoing pancreatic resection. Reported prevalence of sarcopenia varied between 14 and 74%, and the pooled prevalence was 39% (95% CI: 38-40%) Heterogeneity was considerable, however, (I2 = 93%) and did not improve significantly when controlling for assessment method, and use of pre-defined cut-offs for sarcopenia, limiting potential to evaluate the true impact of sarcopenia.Conclusion:The ready availability of sequential CT offers a valuable opportunity for body composition assessment, but the quality of assessment and interpretation must improve before the impact of body composition on treatment-related outcomes and survival can be assessed. We suggest recommendations for the assessment of body composition for the design of future studies.
