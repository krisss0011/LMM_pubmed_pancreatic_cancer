A lot of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are expressed in human cells in a number of transcripts of different lengths and composition of exons. In case of cancer-associated lncRNAs, an actual task is to determine their specific isoforms, since each transcript can perform its own function in carcinogenesis and might have a unique expression profile in various types of tumors. For the first time, we analyzed the expression of CASC8 lncRNA in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell lines and found an abundant isoform that was previously considered as the minor one in this type of cancer. We also revealed extremely high expression levels of all CASC8 transcripts in MIA PaCa-2 cells and, conversely, the lack of this lncRNA in PANC-1. This allows to use them as convenient models for further in vitro studies.
