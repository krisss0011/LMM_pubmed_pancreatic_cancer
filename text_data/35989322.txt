Background:No previous studies have examined the possible relationship between intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) and the developmental ductal variations of the pancreas, such as an ansa pancreatica and a meandering main pancreatic duct (MMPD).Methods:This retrospective cross-sectional study enrolled 214 patients, 108 with IPMN disease and 106 subjects from a community at the tertiary care unit. The main pancreatic duct (MPD) was evaluated in the head of the pancreas by its course, which were non-MMPD: descending, vertical, and sigmoid, or MMPD including loop types, reverse-Z subtypes, and an N-shape, which was identified for the first time in this study. IPMN patients were also evaluated for worrisome features (WF) or high-risk stigmata (HRS), and the extent of IPMN cysts.Results:Among IPMN patients, 18.4% had MMPD, which we observed in only 3.0% of the control group (P < 0.001). Patients with MMPD were more likely to belong to the IPMN group compared with non-MMPD patients [odds ratio (OR) 6.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.2-24.9]. Compared with a descending shape MPD, IPMN patients with an N-shaped MPD were more likely to have a cystic mural nodule (OR 5.9, 95% CI 1.02-36.0). The presence of ansa pancreatica associated with more extent IPMN disease (OR 12.8, 95% CI 2.6-127.7).Conclusions:IPMN patients exhibited an MMPD more often than control patients. Ansa pancreatica associated with multiple cysts. Furthermore, an N-shape in IPMN patients associated with cystic mural nodules, suggesting that this shape serves as a risk factor for more severe IPMN.
