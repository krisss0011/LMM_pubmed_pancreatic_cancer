Background and aims:The purpose of this study was to assess prognosis with different intratumoral vascularity on contrast-enhanced endoscopic harmonic ultrasonography (CH-EUS) in pancreatic cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.Methods:Patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer who underwent CH-EUS before first-line gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (GEM and nab-PTX) therapy were classified into four groups according to vascularity on the early and late phases of contrast enhancement: "Group A″, poor on both phases; "Group B″, rich and poor on the early and late phases, respectively; "Group C″, poor and rich on the early and late phases; "Group D″, rich on both phases. Subgroups were compared in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). We also assessed whether the results with CH-EUS correlate with those of contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT).Results:On CH-EUS, 57, 64, 0, and 24 patients were classified into Groups A, B, C, and D, respectively. The median PFS of patients in groups A, B, and D was 3.9, 7.6, and 10.8 months, respectively, and the median OS were 9.5, 13.1, and 18.6 months, respectively. Both PFS and OS were longest in Group D (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). The results of CE-CT were consistent with those of CH-EUS, and there was a correlation between CE-CT and CH-EUS.Conclusions:Evaluation of intratumoral vascularity by CH-EUS may be useful for predicting the efficacy of chemotherapy in patients with pancreatic cancer. A better response to GEM and nab-PTX can be expected in patients showing rich vascularity at both the early and late phases.
