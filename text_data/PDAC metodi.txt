ABSTRACT
Background  Cancer-  associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the 
tumor microenvironment (TME) contribute to an impaired 
functionality of na
tural killer (NK) cells that have emerged 
as a promising therapeutic modality. The interaction between CAFs and NK cells within the TME exerts major inhibitory effects on immune responses, indicating CAF-
 
targeted therapies as potential targets for effective NK-  
mediated cancer killing.Methods
 To overcome CAF-  induced NK dysfunction,
 we 
selected an antifibrotic drug, nintedanib, for synergistic therapeutic combination. To evaluate synergistic therapeutic efficacy, we established an in vitro 3D Capan2/patient-
 derived CAF spheroid model or in vivo mixed 
Capan2/CAF tumor xenograft model.
 The molecular 
mechanism of NK-  mediated synergistic thera
peutic 
combination with nintedanib was revealed through in vitro experiments. In vivo therapeutic combination efficacy was subsequently evaluated. Additionally, the expression score of target proteins was measured in patient-
 derived tumor 
sections by the immunohistochemical method.Results
 Nintedanib blocked the platelet-  derived growth 
factor receptor 
β (PDGFRβ) signaling pathway and 
diminished the activation and growth of CAFs, markedly reducing CAF-
 secreted IL-  6. Moreover
, coadministration 
of nintedanib improved the mesothelin (MSLN) targeting chimeric antigen receptor-
 NK- mediated tumor killing 
abilities in CAF/tumor spheroids or a xenograft model.
 
The synergistic combination resulted in intense NK infiltration in vivo. Nintedanib alone exerted no effects, whereas blockade of IL-
 6 trans-  signaling ameliorated the 
function of NK cells.
 The combination of the expression of 
MSLN and the PDGFRβ+- CAF population area, a potential 
prognostic/thera
peutic marker, was associated with 
inferior clinical outcomes.Conclusion
 Our strateg
y against PDGFRβ+- CAF-  
containing pancreatic cancer allo
ws improvements in the 
therapy of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
BACKGROUND
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a devastating lethal malignancy with limited available therapeutic options.
1 PDAC features 
a massive desmoplastic stroma with a mixture of cancer cells, cancer-  associated fibro-
blasts (CAFs), extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, endothelial cells, and immune WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC
 ⇒NK cells have emerged as a promising therapeutic 
modality for cancer immunotherapy, as they play a key role in recognizing and killing various types of cancers cells in the first-
 line defense. Despite the 
benefits in harnessing NK cells for cancer trea
t-
ment, cancer-  associated fibroblasts (CAFs)in the 
tumor microenvironment contribute to the impaired functionality 
of NK cells. Particularly, CAF-  secreted 
soluble mediators interfere with NK-  mediated tu
-
mor killing, leading to a poor therapeutic response against cancers. While numerous combinations of CAF-
 targeting a
gents with immunotherapies have 
been developed until now, however, there are still challenges for overcoming the CAF-
 mediated im
-
munosuppressive effects on NK cells.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
 ⇒Wediscovered that in PDGFRβ+ CAFs, high amounts 
of IL-  6 were secreted via PDGFRβ
-mediated sig-
nal transduction; consequently, paracrine IL-  6 
attenua
ted the NKcytotoxic function through inhi-
bition of pSTAT3-  mediated activa
ting receptors. 
Furthermore, we revealed that nintedanib inhibited CAF-
 derived IL-  6, rescued NK function,
 and showed 
significantly enhanced tumor killing efficacyin vitro and in vivo.
HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, 
PRACTICE OR POLICY
 ⇒Based on our work, the combination of expression 
of MSLN and the PDGFRβ+ population, as well as 
the combination of expression of MSLN and the IL-
 6+population, wereinvolved in unfavorable clin-
ical outcomes with poor overall survival in PDAC. Therefore, our novel combination of MSLN-
 targeted 
CAR-  NK and nintedanibcould provide a promising 
therapeutic option for the trea
tment of patients with 
PDAC tumors. on December 29, 2023 by guest. Protected by copyright. http://jitc.bmj.com/ J Immunother Cancer: first published as 10.1136/jitc-2022-006130 on 27 February 2023.

cells.2 3 Along with ECM remodeling, tumor stiffness, and 
chemoresistance, CAFs are major immunosuppressive 
players contributing to tumor progression and metas-tasis.
4 5 CAFs are highly involved in immune evasion by 
promoting the secretion of various immunosuppressive molecules such as cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors
6–8 and CAFs influence the infiltration, phenotype, 
and function of immune cells within the tumor micro-environment (TME) directly or indirectly.
9 10 CAFs in 
PDAC are a heterogeneous stromal population, sorted into three major distinct subtypes with different roles in tumor progression and immunity
11–13; myofibrotic CAFs 
(myCAFs), inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs), and antigen presenting CAFs (apCAFs).
14 15 Among them, myCAFs 
exhibit a matrix-
 producing contractile phenotype with 
high expression of alpha-
 smooth muscle actin (
α-SMA) 
and low expression of interleukin (IL)-
 6, 
whereas iCAFs 
show elevated expression of IL-
 6 along with an immuno
-
modulating secretome. Despite the distinct CAF subtypes with different molecular markers, myCAFs and iCAFs are dynamically interconvertible according to their loca-tion and microenvironment cues.
16 Apart from classical 
myCAFs and iCAFs, apCAFs show antigen-
 presenting 
capacities.
Natural 
killer (NK) cells are cytotoxic effector cells 
that are able to diminish damaged, virus-
 infected, or 
malignant cells, independent of antigen processing and presentation.
17 18 NK cells play critical roles in tumor 
immunosurveillance, triggering antimetastatic func-tions through multiple killing mechanisms. Moreover, allogeneic NK cells, which are critically beneficial to the manufacturing process, allow their clinically scalable ‘off-
 the-
 shelf
’ production without an additional gene 
editing process.19 20 Despite the benefits in harnessing 
NK cells for solid cancer treatment, CAF-
 secreted 
soluble mediators such as IL-
 6, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), 
indoleamine-
 pyrrole 2,3-
 dioxygenase (IDO), matrix 
metalloproteinases, 
and transforming growth factor-β 
(TGF-β) interfere with NK-
 mediated tumor killing, 
exerting poor therapeutic response against cancers.21 22 
For instance, CAF-
 driven PGE2 paracrinally suppresses 
the expression of NK activating receptors, NKp44, NKp30, and NKG2D, resulting in the functional impair -
ment of NK cells.
21 In a TGF-β-dependent manner, high 
levels of CAF-
 secreted IL-
 6 promote PDAC metastasis 
via ST
AT3 activation and induction of NK dysfunction.23 
Thus, the direct or indirect interaction between CAFs and NK cells within the TME exerts major inhibitory effects on immune responses, indicating CAF-
 targeted therapies 
as potential targets for effective cancer treatment.
Anti-
 CAF therapies have been accessed by augmenting 
antitumor immunity
, including many approaches that 
target classical CAF markers, intracellular signaling components, and chemokine ligand-
 receptor axis.24 
Primarily, the direct depletion of a CAF subset has been attempted by targeting specific surface markers in various ways. For instance, genetic depletion of fibroblast-
 activation protein (F
AP) exhibited reduced tumor progression, causing rapid hypoxic necrosis of both cancer and stromal cells, and TME modulation.
25 
Likewise, elimination of FAP+ CAFs by DNA vaccination 
or FAP-
 reactive chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-
 T cells 
was accompanied by increased infiltration 
of CD8+ T 
cells within the TME, improving anticancer efficacy.26–28 
Besides CAF-
 depleting approaches, recent studies have 
explored the effects of combinations of drugs targeting CAF activation pathways or CAF-
 derived molecules.29 
For example, administration of AMD3100, a chemo-kine receptor antagonist targeting the CXCL12-
 CXCR4 
axis diminished F
AP+ CAF-  mediated immunosuppres -
sion via the induction of rapid T cell accumulation and acted synergistically with anti-
 PD-
 L1 immunotherapy
.29 
Accordingly, anti-
 CAF therapies influence 
the infiltra-
tion of cytotoxic immune cells with therapeutic benefits, ultimately dictating the success of immunotherapies. Despite the development of numerous combinations of CAF-
 targeting agents with immunotherapies, there are 
still challenges for overcoming CAF-
 mediated immuno
-
suppressive effects on NK cells. Therefore, in this study, we investigated a promising therapeutic combination to improve NK-
 mediated cytotoxicity through the effective 
depletion of CAFs.
METHODS
In
 vivo studies
All animal care and experiments were performed according to the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of KIST (KIST-
 2020-
 049). 
For in vivo experiments, Capan2-
 Luc cells at a density 
of 2×106 cells or a mixture of Capan2-  Luc cells and CAF 
cells at a 2:1 ratio were subcutaneously injected 
into 
each mouse. When tumors reached an average volume of 100 mm
3, mice were randomly divided into six groups 
and treated under various conditions. Tumor-
 bearing 
mice were administrated three times with 1×107 CAR-  NK 
cells 
or 2
 mg/kg 
nintedanib or both per mice. CAR-
 NK 
cells or nintedanib were intravenously or orally adminis
-
trated, respectively. Tumor sizes were measured regularly using a caliper, and tumor volumes were calculated as length×(width)
2×0.5. To visualize Capan2-  Luc tumor cells, 
in vivo luciferase images in isoflurane-
 anesthetized mice 
were obtained by intravenous injection of a substrate solu
-
tion (Promega) using an IVIS spectrum imaging system (Perkin-
 Elmer
, Norwalk, Connecticut, USA). Tumors and 
other normal organs of mice were scarified and paraffin-
 
embedded blocks were prepared for further experiment.
For histological obser
vation, H&E staining was 
performed in deparaffinized sections according to general procedures. Formalin-
 fixed, paraffin-
 embedded 
tissue sections were immunohistochemically stained for anti-
 IL-
 6 (1:800, cat no. ab6672, abcam), anti-
 mesothelin 
(MSLN) 
(1:80, clone 5B2, cat no. MA511918, Invit-

Clinicopathological characteristics of patients
Each patient had a follow-
 up 
period of at least 5 years, and 
medical records were retrospectively reviewed for clinico-pathological characteristics including age, sex, operation method and pathological findings (tumor size, tumor differentiation, T stage, and N stage). Survival analysis using the Kaplan-
 Meier method with the log-
 rank test was 
per

RESULTS
Nintedanib, an antifibrotic drug that preferentially targets PDGFRβ, inhibited the proliferation of patient-derived PDAC CAFsTo select an antifibrotic drug as a promising candidate for combinatorial treatment in NK-
 mediated immu
-
notherapy, we tested three chemical drugs that can attenuate pulmonary fibrosis: nintedanib, SOM230, and metformin.
30 FDA-  approved nintedanib is a triple-  
angiokinase 
inhibitor that blocks the tyrosine kinase 
activities of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), and PDGFR.
31 32 SOM230, a somatostatin analog, binds 
somatostatin receptors and inhibits collagen deposi-tion via reduced expression of profibrotic mediators such as TGF-β and connective tissue growth factor.
33 34 
Metformin used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes is a potent adenosine monophosphate-
 activated protein 
kinase (AMPK) activator that also reduces TGF-
β-induced 
fibrosis.35 36 Accordingly, to test their antifibrotic function, 
we evaluated the viability of patient-
 derived PDAC CAFs 
in the presence of nintedanib, SOM230, and metformin, respectively
, in a dose-
 dependent manner (
figure
 
1A). 
We tested each of the five types of CAFs isolated from fresh PDAC specimens (online supplemental figure S1 and table S1). Intriguingly, we observed that treatment with nintedanib led to a reduced growth of CAFs with half inhibitory concentration (IC) 
50 values ranging from 
9.76 to 40.84
 µM, 
depending on the CAF subtype. Like-
wise, we found that treatment with nintedanib resulted in a gradual decrease in the expression of classical CAF markers, such as FAP and α-SMA, and was associated with an increment in cell death (figure
 
1B–D). To unveil the 
molecular targets of nintedanib in patient-
 derived 
PDAC 
CAFs, we evaluated the phosphorylation status of three putative targets, including PDGFRβ, VEGFR2, and FGFR1 in the presence of nintedanib (figure
 
1E). We detected 
that nintedanib mainly inhibited the PDGFRβ-medi-ated signaling pathway in CAFs with strong reduction of pPDGFRβ expression (figure
 
1E). We confirmed that 
treatment of nintedanib inhibited PDGF ligand-
 induced 
CAF proliferation (
figure
 
1F). Furthermore, PDGFβ 
knock-
 out (K.O) CAFs had a minor effect on cellular cell 
death under nintedanib treatment (
figure
 
1G,H).
Nintedanib preferentially inhibited the proliferation of CAFs compared with that of cancer cells via PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signal pathwaysTo test the inhibitory effect of nintedanib on cancer cells, we treated PDAC cancer cells, including MIA PaCa-
 2 and 
Capan2, with nintedanib in a dose-
 dependent manner 
(
figure
 
2A). Interestingly, we observed that nintedanib 
showed moderated inhibition of the viability of cancer cells compared with that of CAFs (figures
 
1A and 2A). More-
over, we detected that two major PDGF-
 mediated PI3K 
and MAP kinase signaling pathways were strongly inhib
-
ited in CAFs but not in Capan2 cancer cells, suggesting the prominent inhibitory effects of nintedanib on CAFs (figure
 
2B). We also found that nintedanib-
 treated CAFs 
exhibited 
a dose-
 dependent 
decrease in the phosphory-
lation of both AKT and ERK. We further confirmed the prominent inhibitory effects of nintedanib in CAFs in a Capan2-
 CAF coculture spheroid system using live cell 
imaging (
figure
 
2C). When we produced cancer spher -
oids without CAFs using four different PDAC cell lines (Capan2, AsPC-
 1, P
ANC-
 1, and MIA PaCa-
 2), we detected 
that Capan2 cells formed regular and round-
 shaped

co- cultures in the presence of nintedanib, as indicated 
by 
the relative signal intensity (figure
 2D
). We further 
investigated whether the fluorescence signal reduction 
in CAFs under nintedanib treatment was associated with cell death of CAFs by measurement of annexin V influx in the dead cells (figure
 
2E). An increase in the annexin 
V signal inversely correlated with a decrease in the RFP signal from CAFs.
Consistent with our observations using live cell 
imaging, next-
 generation sequencing (NGS) revealed
 
that the CAF group (nintedanib-
 treated CAFs vs
 
mock-
 treated CAFs) had 902 differentially expressed
 
genes (DEGs) with a fold change (FC)≥ 2
 
and p<0.05, 
whereas the cancer group (nintedanib-
 treated
 
Capan2 vs mock-
 treated 
Capan2) had 192 DEGs 
(figure
 2F
). In particular, we found that the DEGs 
in the CAF group, which were involved in cell cycle, DNA repair, and cell death, were significantly down-regulated compared with those in the cancer group, indicating the prominent effect of nintedanib on CAFs (figure
 
2G). Additionally, we revealed that 
CAFs had a stronger expression of PDGFRβ  than of 
Capan2, showing the preferential inhibitory effect of nintedanib on CAFs (figure
 
2H and online supple-
mental figure S3).
Nintedanib ameliorated NK-mediated cytotoxicity with 
elevated expression of activating receptors against cancerGiven the CAF-
 depleting 
effects of nintedanib, we eval-
uated whether NK-
 mediated killing efficacy under treat
-
ment of nintedanib would be improved in a cancer-
 CAF 
mixed spheroid coculture. Using a 3D coculture system, we investigated the direct cytotoxic activity of NK 
cells (figure
 3A,B
). Interestingly, we observed that 
at an effector (E) to target (T) ratio of 0.5:1, the time-
 
course experiments showed a robust NK-
 driven cancer 
killing 
effect when combined with nintedanib treatment 
(figure
 
3A). We also confirmed the inhibitory effects on 
CAFs in the presence of nintedanib (figure
 
3B). Without 
NK92 cells, there was no cancer killing, even in the presence of nintedanib (figure
 
3C). Moreover, the total 
number of NK cells did not change after NK-
 mediated 
killing (online supplemental figure S4). Mono or double spheroids were used as a control (
figure
 
3D–F and online 
supplemental figure S4). We also measured annexin V influx in the dead cells of GFP-
 Capan2 (online supple
-
mental figure S4).
Next, we found that nintedanib alone did not affect 
the NK cell activities because of no differences in the expression of natural cytotoxicity receptors such as NKp30, NKp44, and NKp46 and the activating marker CD69 in NK92 cells (figure
 
3G and online supplemental 
figure S5). We reason that NK cells had a low expres-sion of PDGFRβ, leading to a lower inhibitory signal of nintedanib in NK cells (online supplemental figure S6). However, nintedanib influenced NK92 cells in the 3D cocultured cells. We noticed that NK cell-
 activating recep
-
tors were significantly upregulated on NK92 cells in the presence of nintedanib beyond exerting their cytotoxic function (figure 
 3H
 and online supplemental figure S5). 
Similarly, we found that peripheral blood mononuclear cell-
 derived NK (PBNK) cells exhibited an enhanced 
NK cytotoxic function and activation in the presence of nintedanib 
(figure
 3I,J
 and online supplemental figure 
S7).
Conditioned media from nintedanib-treated CAFs rescued 
functional impairment of NK cells via a significant reduction of CAF-secreted IL-6To reveal the underlying mechanism of the effect of nintedanib on the NK-
 promoting 
function in the 
NK-
 spheroid 
cocultures only, we assessed the impact of 
nintedanib-
 treated conditioned media (CM) on PBNK 
cells alone. W
e observed that the expression of activating 
receptors, such as DNAX accessory molecule (DNAM-
 1, 
CD226), NKp30, NKp44, NKp46, and NKG2D was elevated on nintedanib-
 treated CM (
figure
 4A
). Consequently, 
the impaired NK function was rescued with enhanced NK-
 mediated cytolysis (
figure
 
4B). Next, we analyzed the 
CAF-
 released secretome relative to CAF-
 mediated immu
-
noregulatory functions. We found that CAFs released large amounts of cytokines and growth factors in the control, whereas treatment with nintedanib particularly inhib-ited the release of cytokines, such as IL-
 6 and IL-
 8, and 
growth factors, such as PDGF receptor/ligands (online supplemental figure S8) and 
figure
 
4C,D). Among them, 
we observed a strong reduction in CAF-
 released 
IL-
 6 
in 
the presence of nintedanib, inferring the potential role of IL-
 6 in NK dysfunction (
figure
 
4C). Consistent with the 
reduced secretion of IL-
 6, the level of both IL-
 6 mRNA 
and protein was significantly decreased in response to treatment 
with nintedanib in CAFs (figure
 4E,F
). We also 
found that PDGF ligands, such as PDGF-
 AB and PDGF-
 BB 
that bind to PDGFR
β, induced the secretion of IL-
 6 in 
CAFs, 
confirming the molecular target of nintedanib 
(figure
 
4G).
Next, we examined the relation between the CAF-
 derived 
production of IL-
 6 and NK cell dysfunction, and tested the 
impact of IL-
 6 in cancer or NK cells. W
e stably generated 
NanoLuc luciferase-
 expressing Capan2 (Capan2-
 Luc) 
cells for a luminescence-
 based tumor killing assay
. 
Despite no differences in the viability of Capan2-
 Luc cells 
alone, the exogenously IL-
 6-
 pretreated NK cells impeded 
their tumor killing efficacies (
figure
 
5A–C). We further 
confirmed that blockade of IL-
 6 using anti-
 IL-
 6 antibody 
in nintedanib-
 treated CM in NK cells prior to coculture 
significantly enhanced the expression of NK activating receptors, such as NKp30, NKp46, NKG2D and DNAM-
 1 
(
figure
 
5D). Thus, we concluded that CAF-
 derived IL-
 6 
trans-
 signaling attenuated the activation of NK cells. W
e 
further identified that direct treatment of IL-
 6 in PBNK 
induced activation of ST
AT3, rather than AKT and ERK 
(figure
 
5E), whereas the addition of anti-
 IL-
 6 antibody 
led to inhibition of pST
AT3 (figure
 
5E). Additionally, 
anti-
 IL-
 6 antibody-
 treated CM or nintedanib-
 treated CM 
inhibited 
activation of STAT3 signaling on PBNK cells  on December 29, 2023 by guest. Protected by copyright. http://jitc.bmj.com/ J Immunother Cancer: first published as 10.1136/jitc-2022-006130 on 27 February 2023. Downloaded from 7

(figure  5F). To confirm the effect of IL-  6 on NK cells, 
we evaluated the expression of IL-
 6 receptors, including 
IL-
 
6Rα (CD126) and gp130 (CD130), on NK cells respon-
sible for IL-
 6 
signaling transduction (online supplemental 
figure S9).37 IL- 6 binds to membrane-  bound IL-  6R α or 
soluble IL-
 
6Rα, and subsequently binds to the signal 
transduction receptor subunit gp130, triggering IL-
 6-
 
induced signaling activation.38 Based on flow cytometry 
analysis, gp130 was ubiquitously expressed on NK, cancer, 
and CAFs; however, expression of IL-
 6R
α was limited to a 
small population of NK cells (online supplemental figure S9). Notably, it is necessary to measure soluble IL-
 6R
α 
from cell culture media, being generated using alterna-tive RNA splicing or proteolytic cleavage. Taken together, the suppression of CAF-
 derived IL-
 6 via treatment with 
nintedanib might rescue the impairment of NK cytotoxic function by elevating the expression of NK activating receptors 
following the suppression of STAT3 signaling. 
Next, we tested the impact of IL-
 6 signaling on Jurkat T 
cells for broad therapeutic application of IL-
 6 blockade 
(
figure
 
5G). Notably, CAF-
 derived CM induced CD69 as 
an activation marker on Jurkat T cells, while nintedanib-
 
treated 
CM inhibited CD69 activation. Further investiga-
tions are required to determine the clinical impacts of IL-
 6 blockers on primar
y T cells.
Nintedanib triggered the synergistic cytotoxicity of MSLN-targeted CAR-NK against MSLN-positive PDACTo maximize the synergistically therapeutic combination of nintedanib against PDAC, we first generated CAR-
 NK 
cells 
targeting MSLN-
 positive 
Capan2 cancer cells. For 
synergistic therapeutic combination of CAR-
 NK, we 
chose MSLN as a promising tumor antigen. MSLN is highly 
expressed in several solid neoplasmas, including 
pancreatic cancer, and its selective expression on malig-nant cells indicates a promising biomarker for targeted therapy.
39 40 First, we confirmed that only low expression 
of MSLN was observed in CAFs by flow cytometry anal-ysis (online supplemental figure S10). For targeting the MSLN tumor antigen, we introduced a 4-
 1BB (CD137; 
TNFRSF9)-
 dependent second generation of CAR 
construct carr
ying murine SS1 scFv into NK92 cells.40 41 
We then validated the MSLN-
 dependent tumor killing 
efficacy 
of CAR-
 NK 
cells using FACS and live cell imaging 
(online supplemental figure S11). To optimize the in vitro NK-
 mediated cytotoxic function, we added nintedanib 
in 
the coculture of MSLN-
 targeted 
CAR-
 NK 
and spher -
oids (2:1; figure
 
6A,B). As expected, treatment with 
nintedanib significantly induced the CAR-
 NK-
 mediated 
cytotoxic function in vitro. Prior to therapeutic studies, we generated an in vivo tumor xenograft model, in which luciferase-
 overexpressing Capan2 cells were subcutane
-
ously injected in the presence or absence of CAFs (online supplemental figure S12). Due to the limited availability of the orthotopically implanted cancer-
 bearing mice model, 
we generated a cancer:CAF mixed xenograft tumor via subcutaneous 
injection of cancer/CAF mixture cells to 
investigate the effect of CAFs in vivo.42 We observed that the Capan2-
 Luc:CAF-
 mixed xenograft tumor exhibited 
higher 
proliferation compared with the Capan2 alone 
xenograft tumor, implying the tumor-
 promoting effects 
of CAFs. Consistent with the obser
vation in our in vitro 
functional tests, combinatory treatment with nintedanib achieved synergistic cytotoxic effects of CAR-
 NK in 
Capan2-
 Luc:CAF-
 mixed xenograft mice (
figure
 
6C–F 
and online supplemental figure S13). Notably, we found that treatment of CAR-
 NK 
without nintedanib did not 
suppress tumor growth in vivo, preserving the dysfunc-tion of CAR-
 NK in CAF-
 rich solid tumors (
figure
 
6D,E). 
However, 34 days after treatment, combination-
 treated 
tumors seemed to recur; however
, the optimal tumor 
reduction in the combinatory treatment group was confirmed (figure
 
6D,E). Thus, combinatory-
 treated 
tumors were excised for further investigation in ex vivo experiments when optimal tumor reduction was reached. W
e noticed that nintedanib-
 treated groups had signifi
-
cantly reduced CAF populations in H&E-
 stained tumor 
sections, 
which positively correlated with the expression of 
PDGFRβ (online supplemental figure S13). In addition, tumor-
 infiltrating CAR-
 NK cells were highly increased in 
the nintedanib-
 treated tumor sections, resulting in the 
acquired loss of the expression of MSLN due to CAR-
 
NK-
 mediated tumor killing (
figure
 
6F and online supple-
mental figure S13). Next, we evaluated off-
 target toxicity 
through obser
vation of histological changes in dissected 
normal organs or measurement of various blood param-eters, all of which showed no significant differences between groups (online supplemental figure S14).
Next, we examined PBNK-
 derived CAR (CAR-
 PBNK)-
 
mediated cancer killing using patient-
 derived or cancer 
cell line-
 derived 
organoids that are suitable for clinical 
study of CAR-
 NK. 
To mimic the patient TME within organ-
oids, we established patient (Og-
 AMC-
 363)- 
or cancer 
cell line (AsPC1_XO)-
 derived organoid/CAF co-
 culture 
systems by adding patient-
 derived CAFs (online supple
-
mental figure S15). We assessed CAR-
 PBNK-
 mediated 
cancer 
killing on nintedanib treatment using a mCherry-
 
expressing patient-
 derived organoid/CAF co-
 culture 
system 
(figure
 6G
). Consistent with the observations in 
the in vivo experiment, nintedanib treatment reinforced CAR-
 PBNK-
 mediated cancer killing in the organoid/CAF 
co-
 culture 
system. To further confirm the therapeutic 
effect on IL-
 6 signaling inhibition for NK-
 based immu
-
notherapy, we investigated the efficacy of CAR-
 PBNK 
cells with 
co-
 treatment 
of IL-
 6R blocking 
antibody (tocili-
zumab), which binds to the soluble and transmembrane form of IL-
 6Rs.43 To test the potential of an alternative 
combination IL-
 6R blocking antibody (tocilizumab) treat
-
ment for synergistic CAR-
 NK-
 mediated cancer killing, 
tocilizumab was co-
 incubated with CAR-
 PBNK cells in the 
organoid/CAF co-
 culture system (online supplemental 
figure 
S16). Remarkably, the combinatory treatment with 
tocilizumab exhibited a significant increase in CAR-
 NK-
 
mediated killing. Thus, NK-
 based immunotherapy with 
IL-
 6 blockade suggests a promising therapeutic strategy 
for effective cancer treatment. on December 29, 2023 by guest. Protected by copyright. http://jitc.bmj.com/ J Immunother Cancer: first published as 10.1136/jitc-2022-006130 on 27 February 2023. Downloaded from 11

The expression of MSLN positively correlated with the 
PDGFRβ-positive population area, while the combination of the expression of MSLN and PDGFRβ
+ CAFs was associated 
with poor clinical outcomesWe investigated the potential associations between MSLN and PDGFRβ for a potential combinatorial immuno-therapy. We performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining to score the expression of MSLN and PDGFRβ in normal and PDAC tumor sections, respectively (online supplemental figure S17 and figure
 
7A). Based on IHC 
staining, we evaluated the association of MSLN and PDGFRβ with clinical outcomes in patients with PDAC (figure
 
7B and online supplemental tables S2,S3).
We found that the MSLN-
 high 
group of tumors was 
significantly associated with inferior overall survival (OS). However, neither the PDGFRβ-high group nor the combination-
 high 
group was associated with prom-
ising survival outcomes. We observed similar survival rates when we used public transcriptomic data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; online supplemental figure S18). Nintedanib directly inhibited phosphoryla-tion of PDGFRβ, resulting in cell death in CAFs. Thus, we speculated that the PDGFRβ-positive area within the TME might be associated with poor survival outcomes rather than the expression degree of PDGFRβ. Subsequently, we analyzed the percentage of the PDGFRβ-positive popula-tion area occupied within the TME, but not based on the intensity of the expression of PDGFRβ (figure
 
7C). We 
detected that PDGFRβ PA varied widely from 0.57% to 32.67% between 43 patient-
 derived 
tumor sections, and 
was classified into a low or high group according to the area percentage (%; figure
 
7C and online supplemental 
table S3). Importantly, we found that the combination of the expression of MSLN and PDGFRβ PA exhibited a significantly lower OS with unfavorable clinical outcomes (figure
 7D
). According to our observation (figure
 4C
) 
of strong secretion of IL-
 6 from PDGFR
β-positive CAFs, 
we further tested the clinical association of IL-
 6 or the 
combination of MSLN and IL-
 6 in patient-
 derived tumor 
sections. Interestingly
, based on the PA of IL-
 6, IL-
 6 P
A 
alone and the combination of IL-
 6 
PA with MSLN within 
the TME were positively associated with poor survival (figure
 
7E–G). TCGA data also showed that IL-
 6 at the 
RNA level was significantly associated with poor sur
vival 
outcomes (online supplemental figure S18).
We further performed IHC staining on patient-
 derived 
tumor 
sections diagnosed with liver and gastric cancer 
(online supplemental figure S19). Interestingly, both MSLN and PDGFRβ were strongly detected on gastric tumor sections (online supplemental figure S19). Thus, this combination can serve as a potential prognostic or therapeutic marker for the treatment of PDAC or other solid tumors (online supplemental figure S20).
DISCUSSION
PDGF-
 PDGFR axis signals are implicated in the prog
-
ress of diverse diseases. PDGFs, as a family of four cysteine-
 
knot-
 
type growth factors (PDGF-
 
A, PDGF-
 
B, 
PDGF-
 C, and PDGF-
 D) are potent mitogens that control 
the proliferation and sur vival of cancer cells and fibro-
blasts.44 45 Isoforms of PDGF bind to two receptors, 
PDGFRα and PDGFRβ, inducing different homodi-meric and heterodimeric complexes, which in turn exert multiple downstream signaling.
45 46 Autocrine PDGF-  
induced signaling is activated in certain type of carci
-
nomas, such as gliomas, sarcoma and leukemia, whereas paracrine activation of cancer-
 derived PDGFs triggers 
the recruitment of stromal cells, such as fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells.
46 Notably, cancer-  secreted 
PDGF-
 BB 
contributes to stromal resistance by protecting 
fibroblasts from hydrogen peroxide-
 dependent cell 
damage.47 Furthermore, the degree of CAF infiltration 
has been strongly correlated with the strength of PDGF-
 
PDGFR axis-
 mediated signal transduction.48 Thus, the 
PDGF-
 PDGFR axis is an important regulator in TME 
modulation, ser
ving as a promising therapeutic target 
for cancer treatment. In this study, we demonstrated that nintedanib, as an antifibrotic drug, significantly inhib-ited the expression of pPDGFRβ in PDAC-
 derived CAFs 
via the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways. T
reatment with nintedanib led to a strong reduction in 
the secretion of IL-
 6, consequently causing cell death. 
Moreover
, PDGF-
 AB 
or PDGF-
 BB 
induced the secretion 
of IL-
 6 in CAFs. In addition, nintedanib exhibited mild 
inhibitor
y effects on Capan2 cancer or NK cells alone. 
The differential effect of nintedanib according to cell type might be related to the level of expression of PDGFBRβ. Resting or IL-
 2-
 activated 
human NK cells express neither 
PDGFRα nor PDGFRβ. Indeed, on our IL-
 2 and IL-
 15-
 
supplemented 
culture conditions, the surface expres-
sion of PDGFRβ was barely detectable in NK92 and PBNK cells. However, a recent study showed that IL-
 15-
 
stimulated NK cells specifically induced the expression of PDGFR
β, contributing to long-
 term NK sur
vival, which, 
however, did not affect the function of NK cells.49 Taken 
together, further investigations regarding the expression of PDGFRβ in NK cells are needed for the development of effective cancer treatments through PDGFRβ-targeted CAFs.
In our study, we revealed that the expression of MSLN 
was positively correlated with the proportion of PDGFRβ
+ 
CAFs, and associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes. Reportedly, MSLN, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-
 
anchored cell sur
face glycoprotein is highly detectable 
in pancreatic cancers and various other tumors, while its expression is limited to normal mesothelial cells of the pleura, peritoneum, and pericardium.
40 The high expres-
sion of MSLN in tumors has been associated with poor clinical outcomes and shown to be involved in tumor cell proliferation, migration, and metastasis.
50 However, the 
expression of MSLN in human PDAC remains contro-versial, in that two studies revealed an association with unfavorable clinical outcomes.
51 However, another study 
showed no correlation with cancer aggressiveness.39 In 
our study, 12 of 43 tumor sections had strong expression  on December 29, 2023 by guest. Protected by copyright. http://jitc.bmj.com/ J Immunother Cancer: first published as 10.1136/jitc-2022-006130 on 27 February 2023. Downloaded from 13

outcomes and poor overall survival (OS). (A) Based on IHC staining intensity, the expression score of MSLN and PDGFRβ

of MSLN (score 3), and showed a significant association 
between MSLN positivity and reduced OS. In contrast, there was no relationship between the expression of PDGFRβ and clinical outcomes. Rather than PDGFRβ intensity scores, the combination of the degree of the PDGFRβ
+ PA and the expression of MSLN clearly exhib-
ited inferior clinical outcomes, serving as a potential target of therapeutic interest.
In summary, we identified the novel combinatory 
immunotherapeutics of MSLN-
 targeted CAR-
 NK 
and nintedanib, which inhibited the proliferation of PDGFR
β+ CAFs, eventually leading to enhanced CAR-  NK 
cell infiltration, activation, and killing efficacy
. Depletion 
of PDGFRβ+ CAFs by treatment with nintedanib led to a 
significant reduction in CAF-
 secreted 
IL-
 6 
through the 
ERK and AKT multiple signal pathways; in which para-crine IL-
 6 led to the abrogation of the NK cell-
 mediated 
cytotoxic function. 
Intriguingly, the IL-
 6-
 induced activa
-
tion of STAT3 might function as an oncogenic pathway in NK cells, resulting in the reduced expression of NK activating receptors. Taken together, our therapeutic approach of combining MSLN-
 targeted CAR-
 NK and 
nintedanib 
might improve patient outcomes especially in 
stroma-
 rich cancers by efficiently modulating the TME.

Isolation and characterization of CAFs from human tumor tissues.  
Fresh tumor tissues were obtained from surgical specimens of patients diagnosed with PDAC, 
which were immediately soaked in RPMI640 media (Sigma-Aldrich Corp, St. Louis, 
MO, USA), and transferred to the laboratory within 30 min. Tumor tissues were rinsed with 
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in a clean bench, minced into < 2 mm3 fragments, and 
digested with 0.1 % (W/V) collagenase type 1 (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) at 37°C for 
20 min. The resulting fragments were centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min, washed with PBS, 
plated onto DMEM media (11965-092, Gibco) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) 
(10270-098, Gibco) and 1% penicillin/ streptomycin (15140-122, Gibco), and allowed to 
adhere.1 After incubation of cultured cells with the anti-human EpCAM-FITC antibody 
(clone 9C4, Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA), EpCAM negative cells were sorted using the 
BD FACS Canto™ II system  (BD Biosciences, SJ, California, USA), followed by culturing, 
while fibroblasts were maintained in DMEM media containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/ 
streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2. For the characterization of 
CAFs, FACS analysis was performed with the following antibodies; anti-human EpCAM-
FITC (Clone 9C4, Biolegend), anti-human FAP-PE (Clone 427819, R&D Systems, 
Minneapolis, MN, USA), anti-human ɑ-SMA- APC (Clone 1A4, R&D Systems), anti-human 
IL6-PE/Cyanine7 (clone MQ2-13A5, Biolegend ), anti-human CD126 (IL6R )-PE (clone 
UV4 , Biolegend), anti-human CD130 (gp130)-APC (clone 2E1B02, Biolegend), anti-human

incubation with antibodies.   
 
Cell culture  
Capan2 and MIA PaCa- 2 were cultured in McCoy’s 5A medium (Welgene, Daegu, Korea) 
and Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM, Welgene), respectively, supplemented 
with 10 % FBS (Welgene) and 1 % antibiotic antimycotic solution (Welgene). Patient-
derived CAF cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Welgene) supplemented with 10 % 
FBS (Welgene) and 1 % antibiotic antimycotic solution (Welgene). NK92 cells were 
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, USA). NK92 cells were 
grown in minimum essential medium (MEM) α (Gibco) supplemented with 20 % FBS 
(Gibco), 10 × MEM vitamin solution (Gibco), 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Gibco), 1 % 
penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco), and rh IL-2 (R&D systems; 200 IU/mL) at 37 °C under a 
humidified atmosphere with 5 % CO 2. Frozen PBMCs, which were purchased from Lonza 
Inc. (Walkersville, MD, USA), were used for PBNK expansion. PBNK cells were expanded 
with 100 Gy-irradiated K562 feeder cells for 2-3 weeks according to our previous protocol.2 
In this study, membrane-bound IL-18/21-overexpressiong K562 feeder cells were used.3  
 
Selection of anti-fibrotic drugs 
Nintedanib (S1010, Selleck chemicals LLC, Houston, TX, USA), SOM230 (24092, Cayman 
Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and Metformin (PHR1084, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) were

Capan2 and M IA PaCa2 cancer cells under the same conditions. Percentage of cell 
proliferation on CAFs in response to different treatment conditions was evaluated using the 
EZ-Cytox cell viability assay kit (DoGenBio, Seoul, Korea) 72 h post treatment according to 
the manufacturer’s instructions. 10 ng/ml of PDGF -AA and/or PDGF-BB (PeproTech, USA) 
were treated to evaluate viability in the presence or absence of nintedanib. Additionally, the 
morphology of CAFs under treatment with nintedanib was visualized by optical microscopy 
(Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).  
 
Western blot analysis  
Cell lysates containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) were 
electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE gels and separated proteins were then transferred to 
nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5 % skimmed milk in Tris-buffered 
saline (TBS-T, 0.1 % Tween-20) for 1 h at 25 °C, and then incubated with the primary 
antibodies against FAP (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), a-SMA (Proteintech, Rosemont, IL, USA), 
pPDGFR β (CST, Danvers, MA, USA), PDGFR β (CST), pVEGFR2 (CST), VEGFR2 (CST), 
pFGFR1 (CST), FGFR1 (CST), pAKT (CST), AKT (CST), pERK (CST), ERK (CST), IL-6 
(abcam), cleaved Caspase-3 (CST), β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA), and 
HSP90 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed and then 
incubated with horse radish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated, species-specific secondary 
antibody at 25 °C, and then rewashed. For protein detection, HRP signals were visualized 
using ChemiDoc (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), followed by detection using the 
chemiluminescence method (Bio-Rad). Full western blots are shown in online supplemental 
figure S21and S22.

For generation of PDGFR β K.O CAFs, 400 pmol of each PDGFR β-targeting sgRNAs were 
mixed with 24.4 pmol of spCas9 (IDT, USA) for 20min at room temperature to make Cas9 
RNP solution. CAF cells treated with Cas9 RNP solution (online supplemental table S5) were 
electroporated at 1700 V for 20ms and one pulse using a Neon Electroporator (Invitrogen, 
USA). For viability tests , K.O cells were treated with 3 μM of nintedanib in the presence or 
absence of 10 ng/ml of PDGF ligand AB and BB for 72 h at 37 °C. Viability was analyz ed 
using an EZ-Cytox cell viability assay k it according to the manufacturer`s instructions.  
 
Measurement of annexin V influx  
RFP-CAF cells or GFP-Capan2 cells were seeded in µ-slide 8 well (ibidi, USA). Next day, 
cells were washed with PBS buffer and then nintedanib was incubated at the indicated 
concentration. To analy ze the apoptotic efficacy, RFP-CAF cells were stained with annexin 
V-BUV395 (BD) and visualiz ed using a LionheartFX automated live cell microscope 
(BioTek, Bad Friedrichshall, Germany) at 24h post-treatment. GFP-Capan2 cells were 
stained with annexin V-APC (Biolegend), and then flow cytometry was performed on a 
Cytoflex (Beckman Coulter) and data were analyzed using FlowJo (BD). 
  
Harvesting conditioned media from CAF  
CAF cells were cultured with or without nintedanib for 72 h at 37 °C under a humidified 
atmosphere with 5 % CO 2. Then, conditioned media were harvested by removing cells.

of nintedanib for 6 h. Then, cells were harvested and washed with PBS buffer. Cells were 
stained with CD69-APC (FN50) antibody. The CD69 expression was assessed by 
flowcytometry. 
 
Formation of tumor-CAF coculture spheroids  
Capan2 cells and CAF cells were seeded at a ratio of 1:1 in 96-well Black/Clear Round 
Bottom Ultra-Low Attachment Spheroid Microplates (Corning, NY, USA) and centrifuged at 
1350 rpm for 3 min. Cells were then incubated for 24 h at 37 °C under a humidified 
atmosphere with 5 % CO 2. For evaluation of NK-mediated killing, NK92 or PBNK cells were 
subsequently incubated at the indicated E:T ratios after formation of tumor-CAF spheroids.  
 
Live cell imaging  
For visualization, GFP- and RFP-carrying lentiviruses were transduced in Capan2 and CAFs, 
respectively. Then, Capan2-CAF spheroids were cocultured with NK92 cells in the presence 
or absence of nintedanib. Each mono spheroid (Capan2 or CAF only, respectively) and 
double co-culture (CAF spheroid-NK92 or Capan2 spheroid-NK92, respectively) were tested 
as controls. Real-time fluorescence images were obtained at 37 °C under a humidified 
atmosphere with 5 % CO 2, using a LionheartFX automated live cell microscope. For time-
dependent NK-mediated killing, images were captured at 4 h intervals for 48 h. Image 
processing and relative intensity or area calculation were performed using the Gen5 Software 
(BioTeck).

 doi: 10.1136/jitc-2022-006130:e006130. 11 2023;J Immunother Cancer, et al. Lee YEFor transcriptomic analysis, CAF and Capan2 were treated with 3 µM nintedanib or not, 
respectively. At 72 h post treatment, total RNA was extracted from each indicated group of 
cells. The whole transcriptome sequencing and data analysis were performed by E-Biogen 
Inc. (Seoul, Korea). DEGs were analyzed using the FC value of 2 and a p-value of < 0.05.  
 
NK functional studies  
To conduct flow cytometric analysis, NK92 or PBNK cells were incubated in the presence or 
absence of nintedanib either in in-vitro  spheroid coculture system or alone. After harvest at 
24 or 48 h, cells were stained in PBS containing 0.5 % BSA and 0.05 % azide. For 
intracellular staining, cells were fixed and permeabilized using cytofix/cytoperm (BD 
Biosciences). Dead cells were excluded by staining with the LIVE/DEAD Fixable Dead 
Viability Dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cleveland, OH, USA). The antibodies used in this 
study were purchased from Biolegend: NKp30-PerCP/Cy5.5 (P30-15), NKp44-APC (P44-8), 
NKp46- PE/Dazzle™ 594 (9E2), CD69 -PE/Cy7 (FN50), DNAM-1- Brilliant Violet 421™ 
(11A8), and Perforin-PE (dG9). NKG2C-Alexa Fluor® 700 (134591) was purchased from 
R&D Systems. Flow cytometry was performed on a Cytoflex (Beckman Coulter) and data 
were analyzed using FlowJo (BD). To test the flow cytometry-based cancer killing efficac y, 
propodium iodide- (PI, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) or 7-aminoaactinomycin D- (7-AAD, 
Biolegend) stained dead cells were analyzed in the NK-excluded population.   
     For assessment of NK-mediated cytotoxicity, NanoLuc luciferase-expressing Capan2 
cells were co-cultured with PBNK or CAR-NK cells under treatment conditions that included 
nintedanib, IL-6, and anti- IL-6 antibody for 24 h. After washing, a cytotoxicity assay was 
performed using the Nano-Glo® Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).

 doi: 10.1136/jitc-2022-006130:e006130. 11 2023;J Immunother Cancer, et al. Lee YEFor construction of a second generation CAR-expressing plasmid, each DNA fragment 
encoding the SFFV promoter and CAR including SS1 scFv was synthesized from 
Cosmo Genetech (Seoul, Korea), respectively. The GFP-expressing DNA fragment was 
obtained from PCR amplification using specific primers. Three DNA fragments were inserted 
into an EcoR1/EcoRV (NEB, USA)-cut pCDH lentivirus vector (Addgene, Cambridge, MA, 
USA, #72266) using the NEBuilder HiFi DNA assembly kit (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA).  
     For the generation of genetically engineered NK cells, CAR expressing shuttle ve ctor, 
psPAX2 packaging vector, and Baboon envelope vector were transfected on HEK293T cells4. 
Lentiviral supernatants were collected at 24 and 48 h, and then the virus was concentrated 
using the Lenti-X concentrator (TaKaRa, Tokyo, Japan). NK92 cells were transduced with 
MOI 100 of MSLN-CAR lentivirus. MSLN-CAR-expressing NK92 were sorted by a MA900 
Cell Sorter (SONY, Toyko, Japan).  
    
Human cytokine and growth factor arrays  
For human cytokine and growth factor arrays, CAF cells were treated in the presence or 
absence of 3 µM nintedanib, and then, their conditioned media were harvested after 48 or 72 
h. Analysis of human cytokines and growth factors was performed using the Human Cytokine 
array C3 (RayBiotech, Atlanta, GA, USA) and Human Growth factor array C1 (Raybiotech), 
respectively, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Membranes were detected using 
ChemiDoc.  
 
Quantitative real-time (qRT) PCR  
CAF cells were incubated in the presence or absence of nintedanib, and then total RNA was 
extracted using an RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and reverse-transcribed

System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using SYBR Green Master Mix 
(Roche). Specific amplicons were obtained using specific target primers. Primers used in 
qRT-PCR are listed in online supplemental table S4.  
 
Analysis of hematological toxicity 
Blood of mice was taken from the abdominal vein. This procedure was performed in 
triplicate. For chemical analysis, 500 μL  of blood was centrifuged for 15 min at 3000 rpm 
and 4 °C, and the plasma was carefully transferred to collection tubes. The levels of aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total protein (TP), blood urea 
nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine (Cr) were analyzed using the Advia 120 Hematology analyzer 
(Bayer Healthcare, Myerstown, PA, USA).5 
 
Establishment and characterization of human PDAC organoid   
To generation of luciferase-expressing organoids, a AsPC1 cell line containing the luciferase 
gene (AsPC1_luc cell line) was subcutaneously transplanted into nude mice, and then, the 
organoid was generated using tumor tissue from mice xenografts. The generated organoid 
was named ASPC1_XO. For establishment of a fluorescence tagged PDAC organoid, a 
patient-derived organoid (Og-AMC-363) was electroporated using the Neon™ 
electroporation system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.6 Briefly, 
Og-AMC-363 was electroporated with pLentiGuide-puro-mCherry (Addgene, #117986) and 
selected by puromycin-containing (1 ug/ml) media. The selected organoids were sorted 
following expression of mcherry by FACS Aria (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA) and 
seeded in BME. To determine the characterization of the generated organoids, they were 
examined by histology (H&E) and morphology (bright field image).7 mCherry expression of

(WES) analysis was performed. ASPC1_XO was treated with luciferin (BioVison, No.7902-1, 
Milpitas, CA, USA), and the luminescence signal was determined using a VICTOR3™ 
instrument (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA ). 
 
CAR -PBNK-mediated killing, based on a PDAC organoid/CAFs co-culture system  
To generate the co-culture model based on organoids, PDAC organoid with CAFs and PBNK 
(or CAR- PBNK) were cultured at a 1:1:4 ratio (PDAC organoid; 5x103cells/100ul, CAFs; 
5x103 cells/100ul, PBNK: 2x104 cells/100ul).8 The mixture was suspended in PDAC 
organoid culture media containing IL-2 (200 IU/ml) and seeded on a 96-well plate, under 
various conditions including nintedanib and anti- IL-6R blocking antibody (MedChemExpress, 
USA) for 48 h. Bright field- or fluorescence images were obtained using Eclipse Ts2 (Nikon 
Instruments, Tokyo, Japan) at 10x magnification. To evaluate CAR-PBNK efficacy on the 
co-culture model based on PDAC organoids, the viability of ASPC1_XO and Og-AMC-363 
was determined by luminescence and fluorescence, respectively. In brief, relative 
luminescence unit (RFU) of the luciferin-treated ASPC1_XO was measured using 
VICTOR3™ (PerkinElmer). The fluorescence of Og -AMC-363 was imaged by an IVIS® 
instrument (PerkinElmer). The ROI of images was analyzed using the Living Image® 4.7.2 
software and calculated after subtracting the background signal.9 To analyze the CAR- PBNK 
efficacy, the luminescence or fluorescence signals of the residual organoids were measured 
under different conditions based on the ROIs or RFU.

survival analysis, the 177 patient cohort from the PanCancer dataset was divided into two 
groups depending on the level of expression of MSLN, PDGFRβ  and IL-6.10  
 
Statistical analysis 
All data represent the mean and standard error of the mean from at least three independent 
experiments. Survival analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test was 
performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21.0 (IBM 
Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). The p-value was derived from one-way ANOVA followed by 
multiple comparison tests using the GraphPad prism 9 software (San Diego, CA, USA). A P-
value <0.05(*), <0.01 (**), < 0.001(***), or < 0.0001(***) was considered statistically 
significant. NS indicates not significant.
