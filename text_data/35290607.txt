Pancreatic ductal metaplasia (PDM) is the transformation of potentially various types of cells in the pancreas into ductal or ductal-like cells, which eventually replace the existing differentiated somatic cell type(s). PDM is usually triggered by and manifests its ability to adapt to environmental stimuli and genetic insults. The development of PDM to atypical hyperplasia or dysplasia is an important risk factor for pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). Recent studies using genetically engineered mouse models, cell lineage tracing, single-cell sequencing and others have unraveled novel cellular and molecular insights in PDM formation and evolution. Those novel findings help better understand the cellular origins and functional significance of PDM and its regulation at cellular and molecular levels. Given that PDM represents the earliest pathological changes in PDA initiation and development, translational studies are beginning to define PDM-associated cell and molecular biomarkers that can be used to screen and detect early PDA and to enable its effective intervention, thereby truly and significantly reducing the dreadful mortality rate of PDA. This review will describe recent advances in the understanding of PDM biology with a focus on its underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms, and in biomarker discovery with clinical implications for the management of pancreatic regeneration and tumorigenesis.
