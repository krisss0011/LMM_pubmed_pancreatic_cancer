Pancreatic cancer is a malignant tumor with very poor prognosis. In the past decade, the surgical technique has made significant progress, but it has not brought desired effect in improving the survival outcome of pancreatic cancer patients. With the development of the concept of cancer treatment and the emergence of precision medicine, the surgical centered multidisciplinary treatment and collaborative diagnosis and treatment mode has gradually become the mainstream. Accurate preoperative assessment of pancreatic cancer has become a breakthrough for further improving the prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer. From the perspective of precise assessment, this paper mainly summarized the status and progress on the following four aspects: the preoperative diagnosis and staging, the resectability evaluation, the neoadjuvant therapy strategy and efficacy evaluation of neoadjuvant therapy in pancreatic cancer, and also discussed the shortcomings and challenges in the field of precise assessment, finally in order to make the preoperative assessment of pancreatic cancer more precise and standard, and to provide useful reference for future research work.
