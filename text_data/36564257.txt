Rationale and objectives:Sarcopenia is defined as skeletal muscle loss and can be assessed by cross-sectional imaging. Our aim was to establish the effect of sarcopenia on relevant outcomes in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in curative and palliative settings based on a large patient sample.Materials and methods:MEDLINE library, EMBASE and SCOPUS databases were screened for the associations between sarcopenia and mortality in patients with PDAC up to March 2022. The primary endpoint of the systematic review was the hazard ratio of Sarcopenia on survival. 22 studies were included into the present analysis.Results:The included 22 studies comprised 3958 patients. The prevalence of sarcopenia was 38.7%. Sarcopenia was associated with a higher prevalence in the palliative setting (OR 53.23, CI 39.00-67.45, p<0.001) compared to the curative setting (OR 36.73, CI 27.81-45.65, p<0.001). Sarcopenia was associated with worse OS in the univariable (HR 1.79, CI 1.41-2.28, p<0.001) and multivariable analysis (HR 1.62, CI 1.27-2.07, p<0.001) in the curative setting. For the palliative setting the pooled hazards ratio showed that sarcopenia was associated with overall survival (HR 1.56, CI 1.21-2.02, p<0.001) as well as in multivariable analysis (HR 1.77, CI 1.39-2.26, p<0.001). Sarcopenia was not associated with a higher rate of post-operative complications in univariable analysis (OR 1.10, CI 0.70-1.72, p = 0.69).Conclusion:Sarcopenia occurs in 38.7% of patients with pancreatic cancer, significantly more in the palliative setting. Sarcopenia is associated with overall survival in both settings. The assessment of sarcopenia is therefore relevant for personalized oncology. Sarcopenia is not associated with postoperative complications.
