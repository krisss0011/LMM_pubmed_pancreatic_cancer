We aimed to examine the psychosocial well-being in the pancreas cancer patient-caregiver dyad, and determine patient and caregiver characteristics that predict caregiver distress. This was a cross-sectional, observational study. Demographics and caregiving characteristics were gathered from patients and caregivers. Caregivers completed validated instruments investigating anxiety, depression, perceived stress and caregiver burden. Over a period of eleven months, 128 patient-caregiver dyads were enrolled. Patient and caregiver distress scores were not associated with patient clinical disease burden. Patient distress was a significant predictor of concurrent caregiver distress, anxiety, depression, and perceived burden. Younger caregivers were also associated with higher caregiver anxiety and perceived burden. Additionally, number of caregiving activities and caregiver overall health status were predictors of concurrent caregiver depression and perceived stress. Certain pancreatic cancer patient and caregiver variables may negatively impact the well-being of caregivers. Future efforts should focus on development and implementation of comprehensive caregiver support programs for those at risk for psychosocial distress.
