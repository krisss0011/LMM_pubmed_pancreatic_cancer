Obstructive jaundice is a major symptom of pancreatic head cancer, and although its amelioration is required before scheduling chemotherapy, the decision to perform biliary drainage for resectable pancreatic cancer has remained controversial. In recent years, the effectiveness of neoadjuvant therapy for pancreatic cancer has been reported. Preoperative biliary drainage has become increasingly necessary, making the choice of stent an important one; thus, the longer the waiting period extends through neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the more durable stents - such as self-expandable metallic stents, rather than plastic stents - would be desired as an option. Still, there is insufficient evidence regarding surgical outcomes and long-term prognosis, and further confirmatory studies are needed. Through this review, we aim to provide an update on the characteristics of biliary stents and preoperative biliary drainage for potentially resectable pancreatic cancer.
