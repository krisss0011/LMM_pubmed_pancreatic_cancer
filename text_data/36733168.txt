We report a case of resectable pancreas tail cancer treated with 2 courses of neoadjuvant therapy which is gemcitabine and S-1 therapy, and pathological diagnosis of the resected specimen revealed pathological complete response. A 56-year- old woman was referred to our hospital because she had back pain after eating for 5 months and her previous abdominal ultrasonography revealed an enlarged pancreatic tail. The tumor size was reduced from 30 mm to 12 mm, and the chemotherapy response was judged to be partial response. The patient underwent distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy, and D2 lymph node dissection. Intraoperative findings showed a pancreatic tail with a depression and surface erythema, thus we also diagnosed the patient as having pancreatic capsular invasion(S1). Postoperative histopathological examination revealed a 10Ã—10 mm area of pancreatic parenchyma, which was replaced by fibrous tissue, with no evidence of active cancer cells. The patient was discharged from the hospital on the 14th after surgery.
