In this phase I dose-escalation trial, we assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Bermekimab in combination with Nanoliposomal Irinotecan (Nal-Iri) and 5-Fluorouracil/Folinic Acid (5-FU/FA). Secondarily, we investigate effects on weight, lean body mass, quality-of-life, the gut microbiome composition, inflammatory biomarkers, progression-free survival, and overall survival. This was a single-arm, open-label adaptive Bayesian dose-escalation study of Bermekimab combined with Nal-Iri and 5FU/FA in patients with advanced or locally advanced PDAC who failed gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. 22 patients enrolled between 2017 and 2019. 3 of 21 patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities attributable to the chemotherapy backbone. 58% (10/17) of patients exhibited weight stability. Physical performance status was preserved among all subjects. Patients reported improvements in quality-of-life metrics via QLQ-PAN26 questioner (-3.6, p = 0.18) and functional well-being (1.78, p = 0.02). Subjects exhibited a decrease in inflammatory cytokines, notably, vascular endothelial growth factor (-0.86, p = 0.017) with Bermekimab. Bermekimab treatment was associated with an increased abundance of gut health-promoting bacterial genera Akkermansia, with 3.82 Log2-fold change from baseline. In sum, Bermekimab is safe to be used in conjunction with Nal-Iri and 5-FU/FA chemotherapy. This benign toxicological profile warrants further Phase I/II investigation of Bermekimab in combinatorial strategies, and the impact of anti-IL-1Î± antibodies on the gut microbiome.Clinical trials registration:NCT0320772405/07/2017.
