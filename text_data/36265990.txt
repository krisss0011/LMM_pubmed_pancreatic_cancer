Imaging and endoscopy play several important roles in the diagnosis and management of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Computed tomography (CT) and endoscopic ultrasound play complimentary roles in the initial diagnosis and pathologic confirmation of PDAC. Endoscopy can also be used to manage biliary obstruction and gastrointestinal complications. MRI and fluorodeoxyglucose-PET-CT are typically used as problem-solving tools for complex cases. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery are often selected based on imaging findings related to vascular involvement by tumors and invasion of adjacent structures. Posttreatment surveillance imaging is used to monitor for complications, local recurrence, and systemic metastasis.
