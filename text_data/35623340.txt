In this issue of Cancer Cell, Huang et al. identify the origin and function of a subset of pancreatic cancer-associated fibroblasts. This work further highlights the power of lineage-tracing models for dissecting the tumor microenvironment in pancreatic cancer and provides new knowledge toward the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
