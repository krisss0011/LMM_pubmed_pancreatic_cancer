Purpose:We evaluated how race and socioeconomic factors impact access to high-volume surgical centers, treatment initiation, and postoperative care for pancreatic cancer in a state with robust safety net insurance coverage and healthcare infrastructure.Methods:The New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System was analyzed. Patients with pancreatic cancer resected from 2007 to 2017 were identified by ICD and CPT codes. Primary outcomes included surgery at low-volume facilities (< 20 pancreatectomies/year), time to therapy initiation, and time to postoperative surveillance imaging (within 60-180 days after surgery).Results:In total, 3312 patients underwent pancreatectomy across 124 facilities. Median age was 67 years (IQR 59, 75) and 55% of patients were male. Most (72.7%) had surgery at high-volume centers. On multivariable analysis, odds ratios for surgery at low-volume centers were increased for Black race (2.21 (95% CI 1.69-2.88)), Asian race (1.64 (95% CI 1.09-2.43)), Hispanic ethnicity (1.68 (95% CI 1.24-2.28)), Medicaid insurance (2.52 (95% CI 1.79-3.56)), no insurance (2.24 (95% CI 1.38-3.61)), lowest income quartile (3.31 (95% CI 2.14-5.32)), and rural zip code (2.49 (95% CI 1.69-3.65)). Patients treated at low-volume centers waited longer to initiate treatment (hazard ratio (HR) 0.91 (95% CI 0.81-1.01)). Black patients underwent the least surveillance imaging (50.4%; p < 0.0001), while Asian (HR 2.04, 95% CI 1.40-2.98)) and Hispanic patients (HR 1.36 (95% CI 1.00-1.84)) were more likely to have surveillance imaging.Conclusions:Race independently affected access to high-volume facilities and surveillance imaging. When considered in light of other accumulating evidence, future efforts might investigate the perceptions and logistical considerations noted by providers and patients alike to identify the etiology of these disparities and then institute corrective measures.
