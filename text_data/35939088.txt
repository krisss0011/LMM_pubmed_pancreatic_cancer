Background:Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is a highly fatal malignancy. The aim was to identify preoperative factors for early mortality in up-front resectable patients following pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) and develop an early mortality risk score.Methods:Patients registered in the Swedish National Registry for Pancreatic and Periampullary Cancer were included. Relevant preoperative factors (n = 21) were investigated. Early mortality was defined as death within 12 months after surgery. Based on the identified risk factor odds ratios (ORs), the Score Predicting Early Mortality (SPEM) was developed.Results:In total, 2183 PDs were performed, and 926 patients met the study criteria. The mean age was 68 (SD ± 8.8) years, and 48% were female. A total of 233 (24%) patients died within 12 months. In the multivariable analyses, age &gt; 75 years (OR 1.7; 95% CI 1.1-2.4; p = 0.008), CRP ≥ 15 mg/L (OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.3-3.1; p = 0.001), CA 19-9 &gt; 500 U/mL (OR 1.8; 95% CI 1.0-3.2; p = 0.040), diabetes mellitus (OR 1.40; 95% CI 1.00-2.1; p = 0.042), and active smoking (OR 1.47; 95%CI 1.00-2.00; p = 0.050) were found to be independent risk factors for early mortality.Conclusion:Five independent preoperative risk factors for early mortality following PD were identified and together formed SPEM. The score might be a useful tool in establishing individualized treatment plans.
