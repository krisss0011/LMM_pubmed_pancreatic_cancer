Genetic and epigenetic alterations play central roles in shaping the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) to evade immune surveillance. The previous study shows that SETD2-H3K36me3 loss promotes KRAS-induced pancreatic tumorigenesis. However, little is known about its role in remodeling the TME and immune evasion. Here, it is shown that SETD2 deficiency can reprogram neutrophils to an immunosuppressive phenotype, thereby promoting immune escape during pancreatic tumor progression. By comprehensive profiling of the intratumoral immune cells, neutrophils are identified as the subset with the most significant changes upon Setd2 loss. Setd2-deficient pancreatic tumor cells directly enhance neutrophil recruitment and reprogramming, thereby inhibiting the cytotoxicity of CD8+T cells to foster tumor progression. Mechanistically, it is revealed that Setd2-H3K36me3 loss leads to ectopic gain of H3K27me3 to downregulate Cxadr expression, which boosts the PI3K-AKT pathway and excessive expression of CXCL1 and GM-CSF, thereby promoting neutrophil recruitment and reprogramming toward an immunosuppressive phenotype. The study provides mechanistic insights into how tumor cell-intrinsic Setd2 deficiency strengthens the immune escape during pancreatic tumorigenesis, which may offer potential therapeutic implications for pancreatic cancer patients with SETD2 deficiency.
