Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest malignancies and is currently the third leading cause of cancer death. The aggressiveness of PDAC stems from late diagnosis, early metastasis, and poor efficacy of current chemotherapies. Thus, there is an urgent need for effective biomarkers for early detection of PDAC and development of new therapeutic strategies. It has long been known that cellular glycosylation is dysregulated in pancreatic cancer cells, however, tumor-associated glycans and their cognate glycosylating enzymes have received insufficient attention as potential clinical targets. Aberrant glycosylation affects a broad range of pathways that underpin tumor initiation, metastatic progression, and resistance to cancer treatment. One of the prevalent alterations in the cancer glycome is an enrichment in a select group of sialylated glycans including sialylated, branched N-glycans, sialyl Lewis antigens, and sialylated forms of truncated O-glycans such as the sialyl Tn antigen. These modifications affect the activity of numerous cell surface receptors, which collectively impart malignant characteristics typified by enhanced cell proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis-resistance. Additionally, sialic acids on tumor cells engage inhibitory Siglec receptors on immune cells to dampen anti-tumor immunity, further promoting cancer progression. The goal of this review is to summarize the predominant changes in sialylation occurring in pancreatic cancer, the biological functions of sialylated glycoproteins in cancer pathogenesis, and the emerging strategies for targeting sialoglycans and Siglec receptors in cancer therapeutics.
