Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) and pancreatic cancer (PC) are two different diseases. Their diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis are different, and it is difficult to differentiate them. This study aimed to explore the role of steroid treatment response combined with serological mark in distinguishing type-1 AIP from PC. Clinical data were collected and compared from 50 cases of AIP (group 1) and 100 cases of PC (group 2). The diagnostic value of serum IgG4, CA19-9, globulin, and eosinophil cell (EC) were evaluated. The response of steroid treatment of 28 patients with atypical imaging in group 1 was analyzed. After 2 weeks, the patients were classified as positive and negative steroid response according to the manifestations and/or the radiological changes. The positive response cases (n = 20) were confirmed as AIP, whereas negative ones (n = 8) were finally diagnosed as PC after complete resection. Serum globulin, IgG4, and EC levels in group 1 were significantly higher than those in group 2 (P < .01), and CA19-9 levels were distinctly lower in group 1 (P < .01). The level of serum IgG4 was related to the accuracy of diagnosis of AIP on the basis of the result of logistic regression analysis. Two-weeks steroid therapy response combined with serum IgG4 levels contribute to the differential diagnosis AIP and PC. However, regular and long-term follow-up were important for the differential diagnosis. There was an urgent need to explore the specific markers that distinguish these 2 entities.
