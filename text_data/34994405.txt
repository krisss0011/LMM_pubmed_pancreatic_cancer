Introduction:Following resection of pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma (PACC) distant recurrence remains high. We utilized the national cancer database (NCDB) to evaluate the role of systemic therapy in early-stage resected PACC.Methods:We queried the NCDB registry from 2004 to 2015 for patients with pathologic stage I-IIB PACC. For each stage, patients who underwent surgery alone (SA) were compared to patients who received systemic and/or radiation therapy in addition to surgery (surgery + therapy [S + T]).Results:A total of 271 patients (101 pI, 81 pIIA, and 89 pIIB) were analyzed. Of all clinically node positive patients (n = 41), the majority (n = 32, 78%) had node-positive disease at resection (pIIB). SA was performed in 112 patients (41.3%), whereas 159 (58.7%) patients received S + T. There was no difference in overall survival (OS) between S + T and SA with respect to pI or pIIA disease. In pIIB disease, S + T was associated with improved OS compared to SA (34.9 vs. 16.9 months, p = 0.031). Single-agent chemotherapy was associated with improved OS for pIIB disease when compared to SA (hazard ratio: 0.38, 95% confidence interval: 0.16, 0.83).Conclusion:In resectable PACC, the survival benefit of adjuvant therapy is limited to pathologic stage IIB disease. This benefit is evident even in patients treated with single-agent chemotherapy.
