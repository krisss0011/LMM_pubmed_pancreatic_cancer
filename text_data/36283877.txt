BACKGROUND ＆ AIMS: Optimizing treatments balancing prognosis and therapeutic invasiveness is important in the management of pancreatic cancer (PC) owing to global ageing. This study aimed to verify the different utility of biomarkers by patients' age. MATERIALS ＆ METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective cohort analysis involving 160 patients who undertook pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) for PC. After comparing clinicopathological factors and survival after PD between aged (≥70 y/o) and young (＜70 y/o) patients, we compared neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), controlling nutrition (CONUT) score, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 as well as clinicopathological factors between long and short survivors in each group. We also performed Kaplan-Meyer analysis between patients stratified by biomarkers. RESULTS: Overall survival (OS) was significantly worse in aged patients (p = 0.002). In aged patients, CEA was significantly higher in short survivors. In young patients, CONUT score and CA19-9 were higher in short survivors. Kaplan-Meyer analysis showed that NLR and CEA stratified OS in aged patients, whereas CONUT score and CA19-9 could stratify OS in young patients. CONCLUSION: Our current results suggest that these biomarkers had different impact on survivals according to the patients' age.
