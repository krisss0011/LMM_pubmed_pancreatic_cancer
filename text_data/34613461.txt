Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with microsatellite instability (MSI)/defective mismatch repair (dMMR) is the only subtype of pancreatic cancer with potential response to immunotherapy. Here, we report the histo-molecular characterization of MSI/dMMR PDAC with immunohistochemistry, MSI-based PCR, and next-generation sequencing. Five paradigmatic cases have been identified. The main results include the first report in pancreatic cancer of MSI/dMMR intra-tumor heterogeneity, the presence of microsatellite-stable metastases from MSI/dMMR primary and recurrent B2M gene inactivation, which may confer resistance to immunotherapy. In addition to the classic PDAC drivers, ARID1A was the most common mutated gene in the cohort. Intra-tumor heterogeneity, B2M inactivation, and metastatic sites should be carefully considered in MSI/dMMR PDAC, which should also be investigated in routine diagnostic practice with specific molecular analysis. The chromatin remodeler ARID1A represents another potential driver gene in this context.
