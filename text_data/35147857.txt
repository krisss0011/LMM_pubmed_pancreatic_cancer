Minimally invasive pancreatectomy has increased worldwide over the last decade. Despite refinement in the technique, laparoscopic pancreatoduodenectomy (LPD) is still technically challenging and the standardization of the technique might increase its implementation and oncological outcomes and decrease postoperative complications, as well. Giving our experience, which was shown in the PADULAP trial and after refinement of the technique, we present here a standardized technique of LPD including technical steps, tips and videos for pancreatic head adenocarcinoma.
