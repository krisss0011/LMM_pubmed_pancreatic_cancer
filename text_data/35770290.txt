Pancreatic cancer is only rarely associated with myopathy. We present a case of a 69-year-old male with recently diagnosed pancreatic cancer, who presented himself with a paraneoplastic myositis of both legs. MRI and EMG contributed to this diagnosis. Treatment was started with high dose corticosteroids followed by urgent laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy. Postoperatively there was a rapid normalisation of the creatinine kinase levels with gradual increase of the muscle strength. The anatomopathology of the biopsy specimen showed a large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. Paraneoplastic myositis associated with pancreatic cancer may be treated successfully with cancer specific treatment.
