Background:Return to Intended Oncologic Treatment (RIOT) has been proposed as a quality metric in the care of cancer patients. We sought to define factors associated with inability to RIOT in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients.Methods:The NCDB was queried for patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy for pathologic stage IB, IIA, or IIB PDAC from 2010 to 2016. Multivariable binary logistic regression models identified factors associated with failure to RIOT, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox multivariable regression models demonstrated the impact of failure to RIOT on survival.Results:Increasing age (p < .001), Hispanic race (p = .002), pathological stage IB (p = .004) and IIA (p = .001) as compared to IIB, increasing hospital stay (p < .001), and open surgical approach (p = .024) were associated with increased risk of inability to RIOT. Male sex (p < .001), Charlson-Deyo scores of 0 (p < .001) and 1 (p = .001) as compared to >2, negative surgical margins (p = .048), receiving care at academic institutions (p = .001), and increasing institutional case volume (p = .001) were associated with improved odds of RIOT.Conclusions:Patient features can impact RIOT and should be considered when designing multi-modality treatment strategies.
