Pancreatic cancer is a malignancy of rising incidence, especially in developed countries due to causes such as sedentary lifestyles, tobacco smoking and ultraprocessed high fat and high sugar diets, amongst others. It is in fact the 7th cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and, in the following years, it is expected to climb upwards to 2nd position, after lung cancer. This is because it may have an asymptomatic course, and when it becomes evident it is in advanced stages, accompanied by metastasis generally. For this reason, survival rates are so low and, even in the few successful cases there is a high possibility of recurrence. Identifying new molecular biomarkers is arising as a highly useful tool for pancreatic cancer clinical management, although much research and work remain to be done in this field. Thus, the present study aims to analyze a series of molecules (IRS-4, Rb1, Ki-67 y COX-2) as candidates for prognosis and survival by immunohistochemistry techniques. Additionally, a 60-month longitudinal surveillance program was conducted, associated with diverse clinical parameters. Kaplan-Meier curves estimating the time of survival according to tumoral expression of those molecules denoted a low cumulative survival rate. Importantly, we observed that high levels of IRS-4 were significantly associated with a bad prognosis of the disease, increasing 160 times the mortality risk. In this way, our research showed a relevant value of these biomarkers in pancreatic cancer patients' survival, opening a pathway for future research areas designed to inhibit these components.
