Pancreatic cancer is one of the most common malignancies with very poor prognosis due to its broad resistance to chemotherapy. ARID1A, a subunit of SWI/SNF complex, is involved in pancreatic carcinogenesis through epigenetic silencing of oncogenes. In this study, we aimed to explore whether ARID1A was implicated in the gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cancer patients via regulating RRM2. We examined the effect of ARID1A depletion on the gemcitabine sensitivity in pancreatic cancer cells and explored the role of RRM2 in ARID1A-mediated pancreatic cancer cells chemosensitivity to gemcitabine. We found that Knockout of ARID1A led to gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cancer cells, effect of which could be reversed by RRM2, a gemcitabine resistance related gene. ARID1A decreased the transcription of RRM2, and directly bound to the promoter of RRM2. Moreover, expression of RRM2 was negatively correlated with ARID1A in pancreatic cancer tissues. Thus, ARID1A-mediated RRM2 epigenetic suppression is crucial for enhancement of pancreatic cancer chemosensitivity to gemcitabine, and ARID1A could be used as a biomarker to guide the gemcitabine chemotherapy of pancreatic cancer.
