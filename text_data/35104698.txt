Novel functions and involvement of circFARSA have not been reported in pancreatic cancer; in addition, its inhibitor screening has not yet been conducted. The purpose of this study was to (1) verify circFARSA as a novel anti-cancer target for pancreatic cancer and (2) to prepare a novel anti-pancreatic cancer agent targeting circFARSA. In this study, we designed and synthesized a small interfering RNA (siRNA, named siRNA-circFARSA), which specifically inhibits circFARSA expression. Using liposomes and porous silicon nanoparticles (pSiNPs) as siRNA delivery system, we prepared liposome-siRNA-circFARSA and pSiNP-PEI-siRNA-circFARSA and investigated their anti-cancer mechanism by quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting. Cell proliferation curves and transwell migration assays were performed to investigate the effect of siRNAs proliferation and migration capabilities of cancer cells. Patient-derived tumor xenograft mouse models were used to investigate the anti-cancer effects in vivo. The data showed that both liposome-siRNA-circFARSA and pSiNP-PEI-siRNA-circFARSA (Si: 0.7 µg/mL) significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. However, the biological safety and in vivo anti-cancer effects of pSiNP-PEI-siRNA-circFARSA (Si: 22.4 µg/mL) were higher than those of liposome-siRNA-circFARSA. The results showed that siRNA-circFARSA could inhibit the expression of circFARSA and then BCL-2 protein expression, thereby leading to pancreatic cancer cell apoptosis after transportation into pancreatic cancer cells. Therefore, this study provides tools for pancreatic cancer treatment in the future, as it (1) verified circFARSA as a novel target for pancreatic cancer treatment, and (2) prepared a novel anti-pancreatic cancer agent (pSiNP-PEI-siRNA-circFARSA).
