Pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) have gained substantial attention because they represent one of the only radiographically identifiable precursors of invasive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Although most of these neoplasms have low-grade dysplasia and will remain indolent, a subset of IPMNs will progress to invasive cancer. The role of the immune system in the progression of IPMNs is unclear, but understanding its role could reveal the mechanism of neoplastic progression and targets for immunotherapy to inhibit progression or treat invasive disease. The available evidence supports a shift in the immune composition of IPMNs during neoplastic progression. Although low-grade lesions contain a high proportion of effector T cells, high-grade IPMNs, and IPMNs with an associated invasive carcinoma lose the T-cell infiltrate and are characterised by a predominance of immunosuppressive elements. Several possible therapeutic strategies emerge from this analysis that are unique to IPMNs and its microbiome.
