The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is responsible for recycling of IgG antibodies and albumin throughout the body. This mechanism has been exploited for pharmaceutic delivery across an array of diseases to either enhance or diminish this function. Monoclonal antibodies and albumin-bound nanoparticles are examples of FcRn-dependent anti-cancer therapeutics. Despite its importance in drug delivery, little is known about FcRn expression in circulating immune cells. Through time-of-flight mass cytometry (CyTOF) we were able to characterize FcRn expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) populations of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients and non-cancer donors. Furthermore, we were able to replicate these findings in an orthotopic murine model of PDAC. Altogether, we found that in both patients and mice with PDAC, FcRn was elevated in migratory and resident classical dendritic cell type 2 (cDC2) as well as monocytic and granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) populations compared to tumor-free controls. Furthermore, PBMCs from PDAC patients had elevated monocyte, dendritic cells and MDSCs relative to non-cancer donor PBMCs. Future investigations into FcRn activity may further elucidate possible mechanisms of poor efficacy of antibody immunotherapies in patients with PDAC.
