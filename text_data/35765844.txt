Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a cancer of the digestive system, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) accounts for approximately 90% of all PC cases. Exosomes derived from PDAC (PDAC-exosomes) promote PDAC development and metastasis. Exosomes are nanoscale vesicles secreted by most cells, which can carry biologically active molecules and mediate communication and cargo transportation among cells. Recent studies have focused on transforming exosomes into good drug delivery systems (DDSs) to improve the clinical treatment of PDAC. This review considers PDAC as the main research object to introduce the role of PDAC-exosomes in PDAC development and metastasis. This review focuses on the following two themes: (a) the great potential of PDAC-exosomes as new diagnostic markers for PDAC, and (b) the transformation of exosomes into potential DDSs.
