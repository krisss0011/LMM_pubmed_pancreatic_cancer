PEGPH20, a human recombinant hyaluronidase, has been proposed as a coadjutant to pancreatic cancer chemotherapy. In early trials, patients reported increased widespread muscle pain as the main adverse reaction to PEGPH20. To understand how PEGPH20 caused musculoskeletal pain, we systemically administered PEGPH20 to male mice and measured voluntary wheel activity and pain-related behaviors. These were paired withex vivoelectrophysiology of primary sensory neurons, whole DRG real-time PCR, and immunohistochemistry of hindpaw muscle. PEGPH20 induced significantly lower wheel running, compared with vehicle-treated animals, and decreased mechanical withdrawal thresholds 5 d after PEGPH20 injections. Chemo-sensory muscle afferents showed increased responses to noxious chemical stimulation of their receptive fields (RFs) in the PEGPH20-treated group. This was correlated with upregulation of the NGF receptor TrkA, the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) channel and ATP-sensitive channel P2X3 in the DRG. Immunohistochemistry of hindpaw muscles revealed damage to the muscle architecture and extensive infiltration of the tissue by cells of the myelomonocytic lineage 3 d after PEGPH20 injection. Peripheral macrophage ablation in macrophage Fas-induced apoptosis (MaFIA) mice, however, did not prevent the decreased voluntary activity and instead caused even lower levels of running. These results suggest that disruption of hyaluronic acid (HA) within the muscle extracellular matrix (ECM) sensitizes chemo-nociceptive muscle afferents possibly leading to altered pain-like behaviors. Ablation experiments suggest macrophages are necessary for adequate recovery of voluntary activity after HA disruption. These data support a role for HA and macrophages in tissue integrity and muscle pain development in patients taking PEGPH20.
