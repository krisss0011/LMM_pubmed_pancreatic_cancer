Objective:To report on clinical outcomes and toxicity in older (age â‰¥ 70 years) patients with localized pancreatic cancer treated with upfront chemotherapy followed by stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) with or without surgery.Methods:Endpoints included overall survival (OS), local progression-free survival (LPFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), progression-free survival (PFS), and toxicity.Results:A total of 57 older patients were included in the study. Median OS was 19.6 months, with six-month, one-year, and two-year OS rates of 83.4, 66.5, and 42.4%. On MVA, resection status (HR: 0.30, 95% CI 0.12-0.91,p= 0.031) was associated with OS. Patients with surgically resected tumors had improved median OS (29.1 vs. 7.0 months,p< 0.001). On MVA, resection status (HR: 0.40, 95% CI 0.17-0.93,p= 0.034) was also associated with PFS. Patients with surgically resected tumors had improved median PFS (12.9 vs. 1.6 months,p< 0.001). There were 3/57 cases (5.3%) of late grade 3 radiation toxicity and 2/38 cases (5.3%) of Clavien-Dindo grade 3b toxicity in those who underwent resection.Conclusion:Multimodality therapy involving SBRT is safe and feasible in older patients with localized pancreatic cancer. Surgical resection was associated with improved clinical outcomes. As such, older patients who complete chemotherapy should not be excluded from aggressive local therapy when possible.
