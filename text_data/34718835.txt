Background:This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) on patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.Methods:A literature search was performed in PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane databases, in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. The Odds Ratio, Weighted Mean Difference, and 95% Confidence Interval were evaluated by means of the Random-Effects model.Results:Nineteen articles met the inclusion criteria, incorporating 939 patients. This study reveals that patients in the HIFU group presented increased median overall survival (OS), along with higher OS at 6 and 12 months after treatment compared with the control group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, patients treated with HIFU in conjunction with chemotherapy presented reduced levels of pain (p < 0.05) compared to the traditional treatment group. In addition, HIFU contributed to significant tumor responsiveness, in terms of CA19-9 reduction (p < 0.05). Finally, HIFU was a considerably safe treatment modality with a low incidence of complications.Conclusion:These outcomes suggest that HIFU is a feasible and safe treatment modality for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer and provides enhanced outcomes regarding survival and quality of life. Given the lack of a significant number of randomized clinical trials, this meta-analysis represents the best currently available evidence. New randomized trials assessing HIFU are necessary to further evaluate their outcomes.
