Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the deadliest of the common cancers. A major hallmark of PDAC is an abundant and dense fibrotic stroma, the result of a disproportionate deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the main mediators of PDAC desmoplasia. CAFs represent a heterogenous group of activated fibroblasts with different origins and activation mechanisms. microRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs with critical activity during tumour development and resistance to chemotherapy. Increasing evidence has revealed that miRNAs play a relevant role in the differentiation of normal fibroblasts into CAFs in PDAC. In this review, we discuss recent findings on the role of miRNAs in the activation of CAFs during the progression of PDAC and its response to therapy, as well as the potential role that PDAC-derived exosomal miRNAs may play in the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and formation of liver metastasis. Since targeting of CAF activation may be a viable strategy for PDAC therapy, and miRNAs have emerged as potential therapeutic targets, understanding the biology underpinning miRNA-mediated tumour cell-CAF interactions is an important component in guiding rational approaches to treating this deadly disease.
