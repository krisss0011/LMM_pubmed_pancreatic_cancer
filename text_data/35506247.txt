Pancreatic cancer, a complex disease, emerges as a severe health problem worldwide and it exhibits a poor prognosis and high mortality. Risk factors associated with sporadic pancreatic cancer remain poorly understood, even less is known about disease prognosis due to its rapid progression. The PANcreatic Disease ReseArch (PANDoRA) consortium, of which the authors are members, was established to coordinate the efforts of different research groups to uncover new genetic factors for pancreatic cancer risk, response to treatment, and patient survival. PANDoRA consortium has contributed to the identification of several low-penetrance risk loci for the disease both by candidate variants approach and genome-wide association studies, including those in cell-cycle and DNA damage response, telomere homeostasis, SCL and ABC transporters, ABO locus variability, mitochondrial metabolism and it participated on collaborative genome-wide association study approach and implementation of a search for functional-based pancreatic cancer risk loci and long noncoding RNAs. Complex studies covering genetic, environmental and microenvironmental factors in the pancreatic cancer onset, progression and its prognosis are warranted.
