Background:Radical antegrade modular pancreatosplenectomy (RAMPS) was developed to enhance curability in patients with left-sided pancreatic cancer. However, no evidence is available regarding the prognostic superiority of RAMPS compared with conventional distal pancreatectomy (cDP). Here, we aimed to assess the oncological benefit of RAMPS by comparing surgical outcomes between patients who underwent cDP and RAMPS with propensity score (PS) adjustment.Methods:Clinical data of 174 patients undergoing cDP and RAMPS between 2009 and 2016 at two high-volume centers were analyzed with PS matching. Recurrence-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), and local recurrence rates were compared between patients who underwent cDP and RAMPS.Results:The cDP and RAMPS groups were successfully matched with baseline characteristics. No differences were found in the 3-year RFS and OS rates between the two groups (3-year RFS: cDP 46% vs RAMPS 40%, p = 0.451, 3-year OS: cDP 57% vs RAMPS 53%, p = 0.692). However, the 3-year local recurrence rate was lower in the RAMPS (10%) than that in the cDP group (34%) (hazard ratio 0.275, 95% confidence interval 0.090-0.842, p = 0.02).Conclusion:RAMPS is oncologically superior to conventional procedure in achieving local control of the disease in patients with left-sided pancreatic cancer.
