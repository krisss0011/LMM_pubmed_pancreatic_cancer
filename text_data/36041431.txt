Objective. Intrafraction motion is a major concern for the safety and effectiveness of high dose stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in the upper abdomen. In this study, the impact of the intrafraction motion on the delivered dose was assessed in a patient group that underwent MR-guided radiotherapy for upper abdominal malignancies with an abdominal corset.Approach. Fast online 2D cine MRI was used to extract tumor motion during beam-on time. These tumor motion profiles were combined with linac log files to reconstruct the delivered dose in 89 fractions of MR-guided SBRT in twenty patients. Aside the measured tumor motion, motion profiles were also simulated for a wide range of respiratory amplitudes and drifts, and their subsequent dosimetric impact was calculated in every fraction.Main results. The average (SD)D99%of the gross tumor volume (GTV), relative to the plannedD99%, was 0.98 (0.03). The average (SD) relativeD0.5ccof the duodenum, small bowel and stomach was 0.99 (0.03), 1.00 (0.03), and 0.97 (0.05), respectively. No correlation of respiratory amplitude with dosimetric impact was observed. Fractions with larger baseline drifts generally led to a larger uncertainty of dosimetric impact on the GTV and organs at risk (OAR). The simulations yielded that the delivered dose is highly dependent on the direction of on baseline drift. Especially in anatomies where the OARs are closely abutting the GTV, even modestLRorAPdrifts can lead to substantial deviations from the planned dose.Significance. The vast majority of the fractions was only modestly impacted by intrafraction motion, increasing our confidence that MR-guided SBRT with abdominal compression can be safely executed for patients with abdominal tumors, without the use of gating or tracking strategies.
