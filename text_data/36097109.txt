Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most malignant tumors and has an abysmal prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate of only 11%. At present, the main clinical dilemmas in PC are the lack of biomarkers and the unsatisfactory therapeutic effects. The treatments for and outcomes of PC have improved, but remain unsatisfactory. Exosomes are nanosized extracellular vesicles, and an increasing number of studies have found that exosomes play an essential role in tumor pathology. In this review, we describe the process of exosome biogenesis, as well as exosome extraction methods and identification strategies, and we then explain in detail the roles and mechanisms of exosomes in invasion, metastasis, chemoresistance and immunosuppression in PC. Finally, we summarize the clinical applications of exosomes. Our observations indicate that exosomes represent a novel direction in the clinical treatment of PC.
