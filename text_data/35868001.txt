Serous cystadenoma of the pancreas is a type of pancreatic cystic neoplasm frequently found in clinical practice. Serous cystadenoma of the pancreas can have a varied morphological presentation on imaging examinations. Therefore, it is sometimes very challenging to differentiate serous cystadenoma of the pancreas from pancreatic malignancy. In this study, we present a case of serous cystadenoma of the pancreas showing focally elevated radiotracer uptake on 68 Ga-FAPI PET/CT. Considering potential future clinical use of 68 Ga-FAPI PET/CT in malignancy, awareness of the false-positive findings is important for the differential diagnosis and management of these lesions.
