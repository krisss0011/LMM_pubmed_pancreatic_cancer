Diet is an important modifiable lifestyle factor, but epidemiological studies evaluating the association between dietary patterns and pancreatic cancer (PC) have reported inconsistent findings. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of several dietary choices on the risk of PC among newly diagnosed Jordanian patients. A case-control study was conducted at major teaching and general hospitals, including a Jordanian oncology center. The study included 101 patients with incident pancreatic cancer and 314 controls. Data was collected using interview-based questionnaires. Dietary intake was estimated using a validated Arabic and reproducible food-frequency questionnaire. Dietary patterns were derived using Principal Component Analysis. Multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate the association between dietary patterns and PC. Four dietary patterns were identified. The "Traditional" dietary pattern, which presented a diet rich in fresh fruits, vegetables, milk, yogurt, and lentils, was associated with a significant decrease in the odds of PC (OR = 0.42, 95% CI = 0.21-0.84) for the third quartile compared to first one. The "High-fruit" dietary pattern, which was loaded with strawberry, melon, watermelon, and other fruits, significantly reduced the odds of PC (OR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.19-0.75) for the second quartile compared to the first one. The "Soup" dietary pattern was mainly composed of vermicelli soup, vegetable soup, lentil soup, and mushroom soup, which decreased the odds of PC (OR = 0.18, 95% CI = 0.07-0.38). There was no relation between PC and the "Western" dietary pattern, loaded with beer, wine, roasted lamb, meat, chicken sandwich, beefsteak, and fried fish. The "Traditional," "High-fruit," and "Soup" dietary patterns were associated with reduced risk of PC among Jordanians.
