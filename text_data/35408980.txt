Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) constitutes a leading cause of cancer death globally. Its mortality remains unaltered despite the considerable scientific progress made in the fields of diagnostics and treatment. Exosomes comprise of small extracellular vesicles secreted by nearly all cells; their cargo contains a vast array of biomolecules, such as proteins and microRNAs. It is currently established that their role as messengers is central to a plethora of both physiologic and pathologic processes. Accumulating data have shed light on their contributions to carcinogenesis, metastasis, and immunological response. Meanwhile, the advancement of personalized targeted therapies into everyday clinical practice necessitates the development of cost-efficient treatment approaches. The role of exosomes is currently being extensively investigated towards this direction. This review aims to summarize the current pre-clinical and clinical evidence regarding the effects of exosomal applications in the timely diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic management of pancreatic cancer.
