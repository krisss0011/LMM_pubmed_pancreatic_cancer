Mirogabalin, a selective voltage-gated calcium channel α2δ ligand, improves peripheral neuropathic pain; however, its effects on patients with cancers including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remain unknown. We analyzed the effects of mirogabalin on a KPPC ( LSL-KrasG12D/+; Trp53flox/flox; Pdx-1cre/+ ) mouse model of PDAC. Six-week-old KPPC mice received oral mirogabalin (10 mg/kg/day) (n = 10) or vehicle water (n = 14) until the humane end point. Cancer-associated pain was evaluated using the scores of hunching and mouse grimace scale (MGS). Tumor status and plasma cytokine levels were determined using histopathological analysis and cytokine array, respectively. The effects of mirogabalin on the proliferative ability of PDAC cell lines were determined. The scores of the hunching and MGS improved after mirogabalin administration with a decrease in the plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and interferon-γ. Although no significant difference in the survival rate was observed, mirogabalin significantly increased pancreatic tumor size and proliferative index of Ki-67 and cyclins. Local arginase-1 + M2-like tumor-associated macrophages and CD31 + tumor blood vessels increased after mirogabalin administration. By contrast, the number of α-smooth muscle actin + cancer-associated fibroblasts, desmoplastic stroma, and CD8 + T cells decreased. Local myeloperoxidase + tumor-associated neutrophils and CD45R + B cells were unaltered. Mirogabalin enhanced the proliferative ability of PDAC cell lines with the upregulation of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases; however, it inhibited the potential of pancreatic stellate cells in vitro. Therefore, our results suggest that mirogabalin improves cancer-associated pain but enhances the proliferative potential of PDAC in vitro and in vivo.
