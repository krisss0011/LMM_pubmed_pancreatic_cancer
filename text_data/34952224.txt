Pancreatic cancer (PC) is an aggressive disease characterized by high mortality. Diagnosis at advanced stage, resistance, and recurrence are major hurdles for PC therapy and contribute to poor survival rate. Mutations in tumor-promoting kinases and epigenetic dysregulation in tumor suppressor genes are hallmarks of PC and can be used for diagnosis and therapy. In this review, we highlight dysregulated genes associated with epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation and histone acetylation, involved in PC progression and resistance. We also explore epigenetic drugs currently in clinical trials. Combining epigenetic drugs and targeted therapies might represent a promising approach for PC.
