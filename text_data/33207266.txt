Pancreatic cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer death in the world due to the lack of early symptoms, metastasis occurrence and chemoresistance. Therefore, early diagnosis by detection of biomarkers, blockade of metastasis, and overcoming chemoresistance are the effective strategies to improve the survival of pancreatic cancer patients. Accumulating evidence has revealed that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and circular RNAs (circRNAs) play essential roles in modulating chemosensitivity in pancreatic cancer. In this review article, we will summarize the role of lncRNAs in drug resistance of pancreatic cancer cells, including HOTTIP, HOTAIR, PVT1, linc-ROR, GAS5, UCA1, DYNC2H1-4, MEG3, TUG1, HOST2, HCP5, SLC7A11-AS1 and CASC2. We also highlight the function of circRNAs, such as circHIPK3 and circ_0000284, in regulation of drug sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells. Moreover, we describe a number of compounds, including curcumin, genistein, resveratrol, quercetin, and salinomycin, which may modulate the expression of lncRNAs and enhance chemosensitivity in pancreatic cancers. Therefore, targeting specific lncRNAs and cicrRNAs could contribute to reverse chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer cells. We hope this review might stimulate the studies of lncRNAs and cicrRNAs, and develop the new therapeutic strategy via modulating these noncoding RNAs to promote chemosensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells.
