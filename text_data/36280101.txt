Background & aims:Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive disease, for which it is crucial to promptly detect actionable and prognostic alterations to drive specific therapeutic decisions, regardless of tumor resectability status. Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is of key importance for PDAC diagnosis and can contribute significantly to tumor molecular profiling.Methods:Comprehensive genomic profile by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on 2 independent PDAC patient cohorts. Cohort 1 consisted of 77 patients with resectable PDAC for whom the histologic sample at the time of resection was available; for 56 patients cytologic specimens at the time of diagnosis also were obtained by EUS-FNA. Cohort 2 consisted of 20 patients with unresectable PDAC, for whom only the EUS-FNA cytologic sample was available.Results:In cohort 1, a complete concordant mutational profile between the cytologic sample at diagnosis and the corresponding histologic specimen after surgery was observed in 88% of the cases, proving the ability to detect potential clinically relevant alterations in cytologic samples by NGS analysis. Notably, clinically actionable mutations were identified in 20% of patients. In cohort 2, comprehensive mutational profiling was obtained successfully for all samples. Consistent with the findings of cohort 1, KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A, and SMAD4 were the most altered genes. Most importantly, 15% of the patients harbored actionable mutations.Conclusions:Our findings show the feasibility of an NGS approach using both surgical specimens and cytologic samples. The model proposed in this study can be included successfully in the clinical setting for comprehensive molecular profiling of all PDAC patients irrespective of their surgical eligibility.
