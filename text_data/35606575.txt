Background:Portal vein/superior mesenteric vein (PV/SMV) resection during distal pancreatectomy (DP) is often associated with technical difficulties due to the close anatomic relationship between pancreatic head and PV/SMV. In this paper, we present our operative technique and short-term outcomes of DP combined with venous resection (DP-VR) for left-sided pancreatic cancer (PC).Methods:We reviewed 368 consecutive cases of DP for PC from January 2013 to December 2018 in our institution, and identified 41 patients (11.1%) who had undergone DP-VR. The remaining 327 DP patients (88.9%) were matched to DP-VR using propensity scores in the proportion of 1:2. Demographics, intraoperative details, postoperative complications and the pathological results were compared between the two groups.Results:Out of the 41 DP-VR cases, in 14 (34.1%) venous resection with primary closure was performed, while the remaining 27 (65.9%) underwent end-to-end anastomosis without graft. A propensity-score-matched analysis revealed that DP-VR caused an increased risk of postoperative bleeding (17.1% vs. 3.7%, P = 0.016) and delayed gastric emptying (9.8% vs. 1.2%, P = 0.042) compared to standard DP. Overall morbidity (46.3% vs. 36.6%, P = 0.332), postoperative pancreatic fistula (31.7% vs. 26.8%, P = 0.672), R0 resection (58.5% vs. 67.1%, P = 0.223), 30-day reoperation (2.4% vs. 3.7%, P = 0.719), and 90-day mortality (0% vs. 2.5%, P = 0.550) were comparable between the two groups. In postoperative computed tomographic scans of 34 patients (82.9%) at a 90-day follow-up, PV/SMV stenosis was suggested in two patients (5.9%).Conclusion:Despite the higher rates of postoperative bleeding, DP-VR was found to be a feasible and safe surgery with acceptable postoperative morbidity and mortality compared to standard DP for left-sided pancreatic cancer.
