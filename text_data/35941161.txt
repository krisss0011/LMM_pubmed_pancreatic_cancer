Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) constitute important cells of the pancreatic microenvironment and their close interaction with cancer cells is important in pancreatic cancer. It is currently not known whether PSCs accumulate genetic alterations that contribute to tumor biology. Our aim was to analyze genetic alterations in cancer associated PSCs. PSC DNA was matched to DNA isolated from pancreatic cancer patients' blood (n = 5) and analyzed by Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). Bioinformatic analysis was performed using the GATK software and pathogenicity prediction scores. Sanger sequencing was carried out to verify specific genetic alterations in a larger panel of PSCs (n = 50). NGS and GATK analysis identified on average 26 single nucleotide variants in PSC DNA as compared to the matched blood DNA that could be visualized with the Integrative Genomics Viewer. The absence of PDAC driver mutations (KRAS, p53, p16/INK4a, SMAD4) confirmed that PSC isolations were not contaminated with cancer cells. After filtering the variants, using different pathogenicity scores, ten genes were identified (SERPINB2, CNTNAP4, DENND4B, DPP4, FGFBP2, MIGA2, POLE, SNRNP40, TOP2B, and ZDHHC18) in single samples and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. As a proof of concept, functional analysis using control and SERPINB2 knock-out fibroblasts revealed functional effects on growth, migration, and collagen contraction. In conclusion, PSC DNA exhibit a substantial amount of single nucleotide variants that might have functional effects potentially contributing to tumor aggressiveness.
