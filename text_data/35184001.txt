Incidence of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is increasing over the last years, while patients prognosis remains grim. Recently germline BRCA1 and 2 pathogenic variants (gBRCA1-2) have emerged as risk factors for PDAC development, as well as new predictors of response to specific therapeutic interventions. However, data on gBRCA1-2 incidence in PDAC are currently sparse and limited to selected categories of patients, as for positive cancer history cases, for patients affected only by early or late stages of disease and mainly from the North-American population, thus generating incomplete information about the gBRCA1/2 epidemiology. In Western Countries gBRCA1-2 incidence ranges between 4.5% and 8% in unselected PDAC patients, raising up to 26% in cohorts with positive family cancer history. To date a limited number of studies from Asian countries are available, reporting a 10% as highest incidence of gBRCA1-2 in familiar PDAC, claiming at least in part a role of ethnicity in the gBRCA1-2 incidence and in other genes potentially implicated in the therapeutic decisions. Drawing a better defined map for the incidence of gBRCA1-2 and other germline pathogenic variants of DNA Damage Response genes (gDDR) might help assessing the therapeutic strategies for mutated patients according to the geographic areas. These informations may enhance the chance to predict efficacy and toxicity of selected chemotherapy regimens, fostering the development and implementation of the pharmaco-ethnicity knowledge in the routine-clinical practice, and increasing the awareness of the potential incorrect generalization of trials results outside of the geographic area where they are conducted.
