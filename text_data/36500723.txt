The pancreas is a glandular organ with endocrine and exocrine functions necessary for the maintenance of blood glucose homeostasis and secretion of digestive enzymes. Pancreatitis is characterized by inflammation of the pancreas leading to temporary or permanent pancreatic dysfunction. Inflammation and fibrosis caused by chronic pancreatitis exacerbate malignant transformation and significantly increase the risk of developing pancreatic cancer, the world's most aggressive cancer with a 5-year survival rate less than 10%. Berberine (BBR) is a naturally occurring plant-derived polyphenol present in a variety of herbal remedies used in traditional medicine to treat ulcers, infections, jaundice, and inflammation. The current review summarizes the existing in vitro and in vivo evidence on the effects of BBR against pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer with a focus on the signalling mechanisms underlying the effects of BBR.
