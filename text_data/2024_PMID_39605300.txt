Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a highly lethal malignancy that 
currently lacks effective clinical treatments. Eliminating stem cell-like cancer 
cells is an extremely promising but challenging strategy for treating ICC. A 
recently developed synthetic retinoid, sulfarotene, abrogates proliferation, and 
induces apoptosis of tumor-repopulating cells (TRCs) that exhibit stem cell-like 
properties, yet its effect and underlying mechanisms remain elusive in ICC. It 
is found that although 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin, pemigatinib, and gemcitabine 
all inhibit ICC-TRCs, sulfarotene demonstrates superior efficacy. Sulfarotene 
induces retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARɑ) translocation from the cytoplasm to 
the nucleus, suppressing P-selectin expression at the transcriptional level. 
Moreover, it directly interacts with fucosyltransferase 8 (FUT8), inhibiting the 
core fucosylation of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL1). These actions 
collectively inhibit ICC-TRCs via destroying PSGL1-regulated cytoskeleton. The 
findings provide a strategy of inhibiting P-selectin/PSGL1 interaction and 
altering PSGL1 glycosylation pattern to compromise the cytoskeletal integrity 
and eliminate ICC-TRCs.
