Desmoplasia is a hallmark feature of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) 
that contributes significantly to treatment resistance. Approaches to enhance 
drug delivery into fibrotic PDAC tumors continue to be an important unmet need. 
In this study, we have engineered a tumor-colonizing E. coli-based agent that 
expresses both collagenase and hyaluronidase as a strategy to reduce desmoplasia 
and enhance the intratumoral perfusion of anticancer agents. Overall, we 
observed that the tandem expression of both these enzymes by tumor-colonizing E. 
coli resulted in the reduced presence of intratumoral collagen and hyaluronan, 
which likely contributed to the enhanced chemotherapeutic efficacy observed when 
used in combination. These results highlight the importance of combination 
treatments involving the depletion of desmoplastic components in PDAC before or 
during treatment.
