As one of the most common types of pancreatic cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is highly invasive and lethal. This study aims to develop biomarkers and targets for the diagnosis and treatment of PDAC. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened via GEO2R, protein network was constructed through STRING and Cytoscape. Functional enrichment analysis was performed, followed by survival analysis and expression validation. A total of 115 DEGs were identified, including 108 upregulated and 7 downregulated genes. After enrichment, survival analysis, one potential gene, Cyclin B1 (CCNB1), was selected for further expression verification at the mRNA and protein level. Taker together, CCNB1 may act as a potential biomarker which provided new idea for elucidation of the pathogenesis of PDAC.
