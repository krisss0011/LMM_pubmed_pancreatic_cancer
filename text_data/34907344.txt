The tumor suppressive transcription factor p53 is frequently inactivated in cancer cells by missense mutations that cluster in the DNA binding domain. 30% hit mutational hotspot residues, resulting in a complete loss of transcriptional activity and mutant p53-driven chemotherapy resistance. Of the remaining 70% of non-hotspot mutants, many are partial loss-of-function (partial-LOF) mutants with residual transcriptional activity. The therapeutic consequences of a partial-LOF have remained largely elusive. Using a p53 mutation engineered to reduce DNA binding, we demonstrate that partial-LOF is sufficient to enhance oncogene-driven tumorigenesis in mouse models of lung and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and acute myeloid leukemia. Interestingly, mouse and human tumors with partial-LOF mutations showed mutant p53 protein accumulation similar as known for hotspot mutants. Different from the chemotherapy resistance caused by p53-loss, the partial-LOF mutant sensitized to an apoptotic chemotherapy response and led to a survival benefit. Mechanistically, the pro-apoptotic transcriptional activity of mouse and human partial-LOF mutants was rescued at high mutant protein levels, suggesting that accumulation of partial-LOF mutants enables the observed apoptotic chemotherapy response. p53 non-hotspot mutants with partial-LOF, therefore, represent tumorigenic p53 mutations that need to be distinguished from other mutations because of their beneficial impact on survival in a therapy context.
