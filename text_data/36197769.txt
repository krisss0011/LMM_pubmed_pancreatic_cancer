Objective:Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer death due to insufficient diagnostic methods in early stage of PC. Growing evidence has shown that long intergenic non-coding RNAs (LINCRNAs) is a biomarker of the early-stage of PC. However, the expression level and diagnostic value of LINC00162 remains unclear.Methods:LINC00162 expression was detected in peripheral blood samples from 155 subjects (52 healthy controls, 52 benign pancreatic disease (BPD) persons and 51 PC patients) by quantitative reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic value of LINC00162, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cancer antigen 199 (CA199).Results:Our data indicated that the LINC00162 expression was upregulated in PC patients compared with healthy controls and BPD (allP<0.001). Furthermore, PC patients with advanced pathological grades, positive lymph node metastasis and positive distant metastasis showed higher LINC00162 levels (allP<0.001). In addition, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) found that the LINC00162 had higher diagnostic ability than CEA and CA199 in distinguishing the early-stage PC patients (AUC: LINC00162 versus(vs) CEA vs CA199=0.932 vs 0.669 vs 0.725).Conclusion:In summary, the LINC00162 may be a noninvasive and efficient marker for identifying patients with the early-stage PC. Further validation studies with a large number of patients and long-term follow-up patients are needed to confirm the potential diagnostic value and clinical utility of LINC00162 in patients with PC.
