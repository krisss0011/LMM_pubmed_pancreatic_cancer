Despite advances in cancer therapeutics, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains among the deadliest malignancies, with a poor prognosis at time of diagnosis. Research in PDAC has suggested that adaptive signaling in the tumor microenvironment may promote tumor proliferation and survival. Several FGFR fusion genes-specifically FGFR2-are involved with the creation and progression of cancer. These mutations are found in a variety of cancer types. This report presents a unique case of a young patient with stage IV PDAC with a known FGFR2 fusion. This molecular alteration afforded a remarkable response to FGFR inhibitor therapy, erdafitinib, after the patient experienced disease progression on multiple chemotherapy regimens.
