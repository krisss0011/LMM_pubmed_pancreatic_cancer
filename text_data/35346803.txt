Pancreatic cancer (PC) is exemplified by a complex immune-suppressive, fibrotic tumor microenvironment (TME), and aberrant expression of mucins. The constant crosstalk between cancer cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and the immune cells mediated by the soluble factors and inflammatory mediators including cytokines, chemokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS) promote the dynamic temporal switch towards an immune-escape phenotype in the neoplastic cells and its microenvironment that bolsters disease progression. Chemokines have been studied in PC pathogenesis, albeit poorly in the context of mucins, tumor glycocalyx, and TME heterogeneity (CAFs and immune cells). With correlative analysis from PC patients' transcriptome data, support from available literature, and scientific arguments-based speculative extrapolations in terms of disease pathogenesis, we have summarized in this review a comprehensive understanding of chemokine-mucinome interplay during stromal modulation and immune-suppression in PC. Future studies should focus on deciphering the complexities of chemokine-mediated control of glycocalyx maturation, immune infiltration, and CAF-associated immune suppression. Knowledge extracted from such studies will be beneficial to mechanistically correlate the mucin-chemokine abundance in serum versus pancreatic tumors of patients, which may aid in prognostication and stratification of PC patients for immunotherapy.
