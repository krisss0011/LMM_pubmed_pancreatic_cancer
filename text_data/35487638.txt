A woman in her 50s previously treated for early-stage breast cancer, parotid mucoepidermoid carcinoma and Caroli's disease was diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) metastatic to the liver and was found to harbour aBRCA1germline mutation. She had palliative chemotherapy, initially with 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan and oxaliplatin, and then FOLFIRI and capecitabine, achieving a sustained near-complete response for at least 86 months. Chemotherapy was eventually discontinued when she was diagnosed with a tongue squamous cell carcinoma. Despite withholding systemic therapy, she has maintained a durable response. This is the first report in the English literature showing a sustained duration of response in a patient with PDAC and BRCA1germline mutation.
