Introduction:The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of cross-sectional imaging for detection of pancreatic cancer (PDAC) in patients with new-onset hyperglycemia and diabetes (NOD).Methods:We conducted a prospective pilot study from November 2018 to March 2020 within an integrated health system. Patients aged 50-85 years with newly elevated glycemic parameters without a history of diabetes were invited to complete a 3-phase contrast-enhanced computed tomography pancreas protocol scan while participating in the Prospective Study to Establish a NOD Cohort. Abnormal pancreatic findings, incidental extrapancreatic findings, and subsequent clinical evaluation were identified. Variability in clinical reporting between medical centers based on descriptors of pancreatic duct and parenchyma was assessed.Results:A total of 130 of 147 participants (88.4%) consented to imaging; 93 scans were completed (before COVID-19 stay-at-home order). The median age was 62.4 years (interquartile range 56.3-68.8), 37.6% women; Hispanic (39.8%), White (29.0%), Black (14.0%), and Asian (13.3%). One (1.1%) case of PDAC (stage IV) was diagnosed, 12 of 93 participants (12.9%) had additional pancreatic findings: 5 fatty infiltration, 3 cysts, 2 atrophy, 1 divisum, and 1 calcification. There were 57 extrapancreatic findings among 52 of 93 (56%) unique patients; 12 of 57 (21.1%) prompted clinical evaluation with 2 additional malignancies diagnosed (nonsmall cell lung and renal oncocytoma). Reports from 1 participating medical center more frequently provided description of pancreatic parenchyma and ducts (92.9% vs 18.4%), P < 0.0001.Discussion:High proportion of incidental findings and variability in clinical reports are challenges to be addressed for a successful NOD-based early detection strategy for PDAC.
