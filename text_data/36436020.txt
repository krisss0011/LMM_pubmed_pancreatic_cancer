Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with expanded tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) or TCR gene-modified T cells (TCR-T) that recognize mutant KRAS neo-antigens can mediate tumor regression in patients with advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) (Tran et al in N Engl J Med, 375:2255-2262, 2016; Leidner et al in N Engl J Med, 386:2112-2119, 2022). The mutant KRAS-targeted ACT holds great potential to achieve durable clinical responses for PDAC, which has had no meaningful improvement over 40 years. However, the wide application of mutant KRAS-centric ACT is currently limited by the rarity of TIL that recognize the mutant KRAS. In addition, PDAC is generally recognized as a poorly immunogenic tumor, and TILs in PDAC are less abundant than in immunogenic tumors such as melanoma. To increase the success rate of TIL production, we adopted a well-utilized K562-based artificial APC (aAPC) that expresses 4-1BBL as the costimulatory molecules to enhance the TIL production from PDCA. However, stimulation with K562-based aAPC led to a rapid loss of specificity to mutant KRAS. To selectively expand neo-antigen-specific T cells, particularly mKRAS, from the TILs, we used tandem mini gene-modified autologous T cells (TMG-T) as the novel aAPC. Using this modified IVS protocol, we successfully generated TIL cultures specifically reactive to mKRAS (G12V). We believe that autologous TMG-T cells provide a reliable source of autologous APC to expand a rare population of neoantigen-specific T cells in TILs.
