A 63-year-old man with advanced pancreatic cancer and pyloric obstruction underwent surgical gastrojejunostomy. Malignant biliary obstruction appeared eight months after surgery and was managed with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided hepaticogastrostomy (HGS). Subsequently, afferent limb obstruction caused by cancer invasion occurred. Although an intestinal metal stent could not be placed, a biliary metal stent was deployed via the HGS route, which successfully decompressed the afferent limb; the abdominal symptoms subsequently disappeared. In future similar cases, decompression of the dilated intestine through the HGS and biliary stent might be a viable treatment option.
