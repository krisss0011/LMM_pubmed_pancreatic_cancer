The plasma proteome has the potential to enable a holistic analysis of the health state of an individual. However, plasma biomarker discovery is difficult due to its high dynamic range and variability. Here, we present a novel automated analytical approach for deep plasma profiling and applied it to a 180-sample cohort of human plasma from lung, breast, colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancers. Using a controlled quantitative experiment, we demonstrate a 257% increase in protein identification and a 263% increase in significantly differentially abundant proteins over neat plasma. In the cohort, we identified 2732 proteins. Using machine learning, we discovered biomarker candidates such as STAT3 in colorectal cancer and developed models that classify the diseased state. For pancreatic cancer, a separation by stage was achieved. Importantly, biomarker candidates came predominantly from the low abundance region, demonstrating the necessity to deeply profile because they would have been missed by shallow profiling.
