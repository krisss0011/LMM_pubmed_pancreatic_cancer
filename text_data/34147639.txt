Despite advanced therapeutic strategies, the mortality and morbidity of pancreatic cancer (PC) have been increasing. This is due to the anomalous proliferation activity of stromal cells, like cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), in the tumor microenvironment (TME). These cells develop resistance in the tumor cells, blocking the drug from entering the target tumor site, ultimately resulting in tumor metastasis. Additionally, the current conventional adjuvant techniques, including chemo and radiotherapy, carry higher risk due to their excess toxicity against normal healthy cells. Phytochemicals including curcumin, irinotecan and paclitaxel are anti-oxidants, less toxic, and have anti-cancerous properties; however, the use of phytochemicals is limited due to their less solubility and bioavailability. Nanotechnology offers the resources to directly target the drug to the tumor site, thereby enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of the current treatment modalities. This review focuses on the importance of nanotechnology for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) therapy and on delivering the nano-formulated phytochemicals to the target site.
