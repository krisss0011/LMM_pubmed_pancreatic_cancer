Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is associated with poor prognosis and remains highly aggressive despite current advancements in therapies. Chemoresistance and high metastatic nature of PDAC is attributed to a small subset of stem-like cells within the tumor known as Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs). Here, we developed a strategy for targeting pancreatic CSCs through forceful induction of mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition driven by encapsulating a phytochemical Nimbolide in nanoparticles. Binding of Nimbolide with the key regulator proteins of CSCs were studied through molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation studies, which revealed that it binds to AKT and mTOR with high affinity. Further, in vitro studies revealed that Nim NPs are capable of inducing forceful mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition of pancreatospheres that leads to loss of multidrug resistance and self-renewal properties of pancreatospheres. Our study gives a proof of concept that encapsulation of Nim in PLGA nanoparticles increases its therapeutic effect on pancreatospheres. Further, binding of Nim to AKT and mTOR negatively regulates their activity that ultimately leads to mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition of pancreatic CSCs.
