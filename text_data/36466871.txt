In the past few decades, great progress has been achieved in the understanding of microbiome-cancer interactions. However, most of the studies have focused on the gut microbiome, ignoring how other microbiomes interact with tumors. Emerging evidence suggests that in many types of cancers, such as lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, and colorectal cancer, the intratumoral microbiome plays a significant role. In addition, accumulating evidence suggests that intratumoral microbes have multiple effects on the biological behavior of tumors, for example, regulating tumor initiation and progression and altering the tumor response to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. However, to fully understand the role of the intratumoral microbiome in cancer, further investigation of the effects and mechanisms is still needed. This review discusses the role of intratumoral bacteria in tumorigenesis and tumor progression, recurrence and metastasis, as well as their effect on cancer prognosis and treatment outcome, and summarizes the relevant mechanisms.
