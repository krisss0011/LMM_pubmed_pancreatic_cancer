Background:Pancreatic cancer is a cancer with an insidious course. Since disease is often diagnosed at advanced stages, clinical outcome is impaired. Thus identification of biomarkers for this malignancy has importance in enhancement of patients' survival.Methods and results:In the current study, we assessed expression levels of miR-8073 and miR-642 in the circulation of 50 patients with pancreatic cancer and 50 controls. Plasma levels of miR-8073 and miR-642 were significantly higher in patients with pancreatic cancer compared with controls (P value < 0.0001 and P value = 0.0068, respectively). Plasma levels of miR-642 were inversely correlated with albumin levels (R=-0.28, P value = 0.049), WBC count (R=-0.35, P value = 0.01), as well as CRP level (R=-0.30, P value = 0.035). On the other hand, levels of this miRNA were positively correlated with lipase level (R = 0.29, P value = 0.042). Levels of miR-8073 were not correlated with any of the available parameters. Plasma levels of miR-8073 could separate patients with pancreatic cancer from controls with AUC, sensitivity and specificity values of 0.82, 0.77 and 0.78, respectively. miR-642 could differentiate these two groups with AUC, sensitivity and specificity values of 0.63, 0.58 and 0.78, respectively. Combination of these two parameters resulted in AUC, sensitivity and specificity values of 0.79, 0.77 and 0.78, respectively.Conclusions:Taken together, these two miRNAs are suggested as possible blood markers for pancreatic cancer.
