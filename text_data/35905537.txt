Background:Genomic profiling of tumors is available, but whether the small fragment obtained via endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle biopsy (EUS-FNB) is sufficient for these examinations is unknown. Here we investigated whether EUS-FNB specimens are suitable for genomic profiling to identify oncogenic and drug-matched mutations.Methods:We constructed a pancreatobiliary cancer panel for targeted panel sequencing that covered 60 significantly mutated genes and compared the results with those of whole-exome sequencing (WES). In total, 20 and 53 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues obtained via surgery and EUS-FNB were analyzed, respectively. First, we examined the DNA quality and genomic profiles of 20 paired samples from 20 malignant lesions obtained via surgery and EUS-FNB. We then tested 33 samples obtained via EUS-FNB from 24 malignant and 9 benign lesions for the discrimination of malignancy. Finally, we explored drug-matched mutations from EUS-FNB specimens.Results:Although the DNA quantity obtained via surgery was higher than that obtained via EUS-FNB (P = 0.017), the DNA quality and mean depth were equivalent (P = 0.441 and P = 0.251). Panel sequencing of EUS-FNB specimens identified more oncogenic mutations than WES (90 % vs. 50 %). Furthermore, the number of oncogenic mutations did not differ between EUS-FNB and surgically resected specimens. Genomic profiling of EUS-FNB specimens enabled the discrimination of malignancy with 98 % accuracy. Of 44 malignant lesions, drug-matched alterations were identified in 14 % (6/44) of malignant lesions.Conclusion:EUS-FNB specimens can be widely utilized for diagnostic purposes, discrimination of malignancy, and detection of drug-matched mutations for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
