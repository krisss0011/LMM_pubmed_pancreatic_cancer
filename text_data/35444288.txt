Background:Large-scale epidemiological studies on pancreatic cancer in non-Western populations are insufficient. We investigated the risk factors for pancreatic cancer.Methods:Using the Korean National Health Insurance database, subjects who participated in the health examination program between 2005 and 2006 were identified and followed up until 2017. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for pancreatic cancer risk were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model.Results:During 11.5 years follow-up, 22,543 of 7,445,947 participants were newly diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Compared with normal-weight subjects, pancreatic cancer risk was increased in those with severe obesity (BMI ≥ 28 kg/m2) (HR = 1.16; 95% CI, 1.11-1.23). Subjects with diabetes had an increased risk compared with those without diabetes (HR = 1.48; 95% CI, 1.43-1.53). Current smokers had a higher risk than never smokers (HR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.38-1.48). Current smoking combined with diabetes increased the risk compared with never smokers without diabetes (HR = 2.13; 95% CI, 2.00-2.28). Current smoking combined with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2had an increased risk compared with never smokers with BMI < 23 kg/m2(HR = 1.55; 95% CI, 1.46-1.65).Conclusion:Smoking, obesity, and diabetes are significant risk factors for pancreatic cancer in Koreans. Lifestyle modifications for smoking and obesity would be beneficial for pancreatic cancer prevention.
