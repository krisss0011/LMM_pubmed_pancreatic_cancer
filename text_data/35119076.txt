Pancreatic cancer (PaCa) exhibits one of the poorest prognoses among all gastrointestinal cancers due to the rapid development of treatment resistance, which renders chemotherapy and radiotherapy no longer effective. However, the mechanisms through which PaCa becomes resistant to radiotherapy are unknown. Here, we established radiation‑resistant PaCa cell lines to investigate the factors involved in radiation resistance. The role of the C‑X‑C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12)/C‑X‑C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) axis in radiation resistance in PaCa and the effects of a CXCR4 antagonist on radiation‑resistant PaCa cell lines were investigated. As confirmed by immunofluorescence staining, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and western blotting, the expression of CXCR4 was higher in radiation‑resistant PaCa cell lines than that noted in normal PaCa cell lines. The invasion ability of radiation‑resistant PaCa cell lines was greater than that of normal cell lines and was enhanced by CXCL12 treatment and coculture with fibroblasts; this enhanced invasion ability was suppressed by the CXCR4 antagonist AMD070. Irradiation after treatment with the CXCR4 antagonist suppressed the colonization of radiation‑resistant PaCa cell lines. In conclusion, the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis may be involved in the radiation resistance of PaCa. These findings may facilitate the development of novel treatments for PaCa.
