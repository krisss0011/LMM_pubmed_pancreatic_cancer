Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the predominant form of pancreatic cancer and has devastating consequences on affected families and society. Its dismal prognosis is attributed to poor specificity of symptoms during early stages. It is widely believed that PDAC patients with the wildtype (WT) KRAS gene benefit more from currently available treatments than those with KRAS mutations. The oncogenic genetic changes alternations generally found in KRAS wildtype PDAC are related to either the KRAS pathway or microsatellite instability/mismatch repair deficiency (MSI/dMMR), which enable the application of tailored treatments based on each patient's genetic characteristics. This review focuses on targeted therapies against alternative tumour mechanisms in KRAS WT PDAC.
