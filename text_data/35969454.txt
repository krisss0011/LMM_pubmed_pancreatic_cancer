This work describes the traditional wet and green synthetic approaches, structural features, and extensive bioactivity study for a new coordination polymer [Ag(μ-PTA)(Df)(H2O)]n·3nH2O (1) that bears a silver(I) center, a 1,3,5-triaza-phosphaadamantane (PTA) linker, and a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, diclofenac (Df-). Compared to cisplatin, compound1exhibits both anti-inflammatory properties and very remarkable cytotoxicity toward various cancer cell lines with a high value of selectivity index. Additionally, the 3D model representing human pancreas/duct carcinoma (PANC-1) and human lung adenocarcinoma (A549) was designed and applied as a clear proof of the remarkable therapeutic potential of1. The obtained experimental data indicate that1induces an apoptotic pathway via reactive oxygen species generation, targeting mitochondria due to their membrane depolarization. This study broadens a group of bioactive metal-organic networks and highlights the significant potential of such compounds in developing advanced therapeutic solutions.
