Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a poor response to the first-line chemotherapy drug gemcitabine. We previously identified stanniocalcin-1 as a gemcitabine-resistant-related gene, but its specific role and function in pancreatic cancer remain unclear. RT-qPCR and Western blot were used to evaluate differential protein and mRNA expressions. The biological functions of genes were determined using proliferation and drug-resistance experiments. Subcutaneous tumorigenesis experiment was performed on nude mice. Prognostic analysis was performed using public databases and our clinical data. We found HIF-1α-regulated STC1 expression mediated chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer. Deeper, we explored the action mechanism of STC1 and identified PI3K/AKT as the downstream signaling pathway of STC1. Furthermore, we analyzed clinical data and found that STC1 expression was related to the prognosis of gemcitabine-treated patients after surgery. In general, we proved the HIF-1α/STC1/PI3K-AKT axis participated in PDAC progression and chemoresistance, and STC1 may serve as a potential prognostic factor and therapeutic target for PDAC treatment.
