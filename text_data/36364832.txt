This review summarizes the main pancreatic diseases from a nutritional approach. Nutrition is a cornerstone of pancreatic disease and is sometimes undervalued. An early identification of malnutrition is the first step in maintaining an adequate nutritional status in acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. Following a proper diet is a pillar in the treatment of pancreatic diseases and, often, nutritional counseling becomes essential. In addition, some patients will require oral nutritional supplements and fat-soluble vitamins to combat certain deficiencies. Other patients will require enteral nutrition by nasoenteric tube or total parenteral nutrition in order to maintain the requirements, depending on the pathology and its consequences. Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, defined as a significant decrease in pancreatic enzymes or bicarbonate until the digestive function is impaired, is common in pancreatic diseases and is the main cause of malnutrition. Pancreatic enzymes therapy allows for the management of these patients. Nutrition can improve the nutritional status and quality of life of these patients and may even improve life expectancy in patients with pancreatic cancer. For this reason, nutrition must maintain the importance it deserves.
