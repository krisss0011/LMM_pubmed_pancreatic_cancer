Background:Nerve invasion (N-inv) is an important prognostic factor in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Elucidation of circulating N-inv stimulators could provide deeper insights and novel perspectives for PDAC therapy. The interleukin (IL)-6/gp130 axis was evaluated in this study as a candidate N-inv stimulator.Methods:A human pancreatic cancer (PC) cell, Capan-1, was confirmed to have the stimulant activity of IL-6/gp130 axis through the evaluation of mRNA, cell surface protein and intracellular protein levels and chemotaxis and wound healing assay. The upregulation of IL-6/gp130 axis was evaluated using tumor-derived IL-6 level and intratumoral pSTAT3 expression in N-inv of murine sciatic nerves by intraneural injection of Capan-1 cell (N-inv model) and using resected pancreatic cancer tissue and clinical data from 46 PDAC patients.Results:mRNA and protein expressions of IL-6 and IL-6 receptor were found in whole cell lysate and condition medium from PC cell. Cell surface protein expression of gp130 were clearly detected on PC cell. IL-6 promoted migration and chemotaxis of PC cell. Serum IL-6 and tumoral IL-6 mRNA levels in N-inv model mice were significantly higher than those in subcutaneous tumor mice (p = 0.004 and p = 0.002, respectively). Silencing of IL-6 and gp130 on PC cell and administration of an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, tocilizumab, suppressed N-inv, compared to each control (p = 0.070, p = 0.118 and p = 0.122, respectively). In PDAC patients, the high-N-inv group showed poor prognosis (p =0.059) and elevated serum levels of IL-6 and C-reactive protein, synthesis of which is promoted by IL-6, compared to those in the low-N-inv group (p = 0.006 and p = 0.075, respectively). Tumoral gp130 expression at N-inv was higher than that in the primary pancreatic tumor (p = 0.026).Conclusion:Biological activity of IL-6/gp130 axis promoted N-inv in murine model and was upregulated in PDAC patients with severe N-inv. This study is the first evidence that the IL-6/gp130 axis offers a potential therapeutic target in PDAC with N-inv.
