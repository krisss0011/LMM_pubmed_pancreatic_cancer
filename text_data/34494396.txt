Background:Pancreatic cancer (PC) is among the deadliest cancers of the gastrointestinal tract worldwide and a growing global health concern.Aim:This study was aimed to evaluate the survival rate and prognostic factors of survival in patients with PC.Methods:In this retrospective cohort study, the records of 556 patients with PC registered in the hospital cancer registration system from September 2007 to September 2020 were evaluated. In this regard, demographic data, tumor characteristics, received treatments, and patients' final status were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier and Cox's regression were used for univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively.Results:The 5-year survival rate was found to be 4.3%. The median survival time was 12.4 ± 6.6 months. Univariate analysis showed that age, BMI (kg/m2), blood transfusions, differentiation, tumor stage, tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, lymph node ratio (LNR), and type of treatment received were significantly associated with patient survival (p < .05). Multivariate Cox regression indicated that the age ≥60 years [Hazard Ratio (HR) = 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03-1.49], BMI <18 (kg/m2; HR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.13-2.14), poor differentiation (HR = 2.12, 95% CI = 1.75-2.49), tumor size >2.5 cm (HR = 4.61, 95% CI = 3.30-6.78), metastasis presence (HR = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.49-2.60), more than two involved lymph nodes (HR = 1.52, 95% CI = 1.31-1.77), LNR <0.2 (HR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.36-0.77), and adjuvant therapy with surgery and chemotherapy (HR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.28-0.61) are the most important prognostic factors of survival in patients with PC (p < .05).Conclusions:This study showed that the survival rate of patients with pancreatic cancer varies based on the characteristics of the tumor and the type of treatment received.
