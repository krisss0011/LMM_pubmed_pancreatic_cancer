A 71-year-old man presented to our hospital with abdominal pain. He was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. Peritoneal washing cytology(CY)was positive, and laparotomy findings revealed severe inflammatory changes of pancreatitis, suggesting a high likelihood of the need for combined resection of other organs. Therefore, following the exploratory laparotomy, mFOLFIRINOX was initiated as chemotherapy. After 24 courses of mFOLFIRINOX, he developed drug-induced pneumonia. Therefore, chemotherapy was interrupted, and a steroid was started. Radiotherapy was administered during steroid tapering. There was no evidence of local progression or distant metastasis. A radical resection that included pancreaticoduodenectomy and right hemicolectomy was performed 23 months after the exploratory laparotomy. CY was negative and R0 resection was achieved. However, 5 months after the operation, he developed liver abscesses and cholangitis and was suspected to have liver metastasis. He underwent PTAD and PTCD, but died due to liver failure 8 months postoperatively. The early recurrence of this case might have been caused by the lack of postoperative chemotherapy due to his frailty. Surgical indications should be carefully judged if there is a high risk of recurrence after NAC and a high possibility that ACT cannot be performed after radical surgery.
