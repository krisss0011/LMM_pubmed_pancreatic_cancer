Introduction:Liver steatosis (LS) has been increasingly described in preoperative imaging of patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). The aim of this study was to assess the impact of preoperative LS on complications after PD and identify possible contributors to LS development in this specific cohort.Methods:Pancreatic head adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients scheduled for PD, with preoperative CT-imaging available were included in the study. LS was defined as mean liver density lower than 45 Hounsfield units. Patients showing preoperative LS were matched for patient age, gender, BMI, ASA score, neoadjuvant treatment, and vascular and multivisceral resections, based on propensity scores in a 1:2 ratio to patients with no LS. The primary outcome was postoperative complication severity at 90 days as measured by the comprehensive complication index (CCI) RESULTS: Overall, 247 patients were included in the study. Forty-three (17%) patients presented with LS at preoperative CT-scan. After matching, the LS group included 37 patients, whereas the non-LS group had 74 patients. LS patients had a higher mean (SD) CCI, 29.7 (24.5) versus 19.5 (22.5), p = 0.035, and a longer length of hospital stay, median [IQR] 12 [8-26] versus 8 [7-13] days, p = 0.006 compared with non-LS patients. On multivariate analysis, variables independently associated with CCI were: LS (16% increase, p = 0.048), male sex (19% increase, p = 0.030), ASA score â‰¥ 3 (26% increase, p = 0.002), fistula risk score (FRS) (28% increase for each point of FRS, p = 0.001) and vascular resection (20% increase, p = 0.019).Conclusion:Preliminary evidence suggests that preoperative LS assessed by CT-scan influences complication severity in patients undergoing PD for PDAC.
