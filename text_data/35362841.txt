Background:The NCCN guidelines define pancreatic cancer that has contact with an aberrant right hepatic artery (A-RHA) as a borderline-resectable tumor. However, the impact of tumor contact with an A-RHA on surgical and survival outcomes has not been well discussed.Methods:A total of 541 patients who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy for resectable and borderline-resectable pancreatic cancer between 2002 and 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. The presence of an A-RHA and tumor contact with an A-RHA were evaluated based on the preoperative computed tomography findings. Patients with resectable tumors and tumors with A-RHA-contact (having contact with an A-RHA without involvement of the major arteries) were generally treated by upfront surgery, whereas those with borderline-resectable tumors generally underwent neoadjuvant therapy and subsequent resection.Results:Among the 541 patients, 116 (21.4%) had an A-RHA and 15 (2.8%) had tumor with A-RHA-contact. The A-RHA was resected in 12, and arterial reconstruction was performed in 8. The rates of morbidity and R1 resection in patients with an A-RHA (32.8 and 10.3%, respectively) were comparable to those without an A-RHA (27.3 and 11.3%, respectively). The overall survival in patients with A-RHA-contact was significantly worse than that in patients with borderline-resectable tumors (median survival time, 14.6 vs. 35.3 months, p = 0.048).Conclusions:Although upfront resection was safely performed and led to a high R0 resection rate in patients with A-RHA-contact, the survival outcome was dismal. A tumor with A-RHA-contact should be regarded as technically resectable but oncologically borderline-resectable. Upfront surgery may not be appropriate for patients with A-RHA-contact.
