Background/purpose:The day of the week can impact medical treatment outcomes; however, few large-scale, disease-specific studies have focused on the association between the day of the week and mortality in patients after pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic head cancer.Methods:Data were obtained from the National Clinical Database. Twenty-two clinical variables were adopted for hierarchal logistic regression modeling to determine adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for surgical mortality after elective pancreatoduodenectomy.Results:The 30-day mortality and surgical mortality rates were 1.0% and 1.7%, respectively (n = 29 720). Surgeries were performed the least on Fridays (13.4%) compared with other weekdays. Crude rates of severe postoperative complications (mean, 14.1%; range, 13.5%-14.8%) and pancreatic fistulas (mean, 10.0%; range, 9.6%-10.3%) remained stable throughout the week. Unadjusted/adjusted ORs did not significantly differ between Friday and Monday (0.868, 95% CI: 0.636-1.173, P = .365, and 0.928, 95% CI: 0.668-1.287, P = .653, respectively), and results were similar for the remaining weekdays. Nineteen independent factors were associated with surgical mortality.Conclusions:The rate of perioperative mortality for elective pancreatoduodenectomy is low in Japan, with no evidence of disparities in surgical mortality rates between weekdays.
