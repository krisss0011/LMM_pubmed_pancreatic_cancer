INTRODUCTION: Minimally-invasive surgical methods have been becoming ever more 
common also in the segment of pancreatic surgery. The aim of this paper was to 
analyze the current state of minimally-invasive surgery in the Czech Republic 
and the justification and potential of implementing such procedures.
METHODS: Analysis of high volume centers using healthcare providers´ and payers´ 
data.
RESULTS: Thirteen pancreatic surgical centers meet the proposed criteria for 
being called a high volume center - a center of highly specialized care in 
pancreatic surgery based on the annual number of at least 17 major resections of 
the pancreas. According to data from healthcare payers, laparoscopy was used in 
0.6%-65.7% of procedures in individual centers. However, these are not resection 
procedures. The centers themselves report a significantly smaller number of 
minimally-invasive pancreatic resection procedures. The actual numbers of 
minimally-invasive resection procedures in the current system are practically 
impossible to verify. The potential for implementing minimally-invasive 
pancreatic surgery in the Czech Republic can be estimated based on the 
identification of candidate patients.
CONCLUSION: Due to the fragmentation of this operative segment, its costs and 
small numbers of patients suitable for minimally-invasive pancreatic surgery 
even among high volume centers, the implementation rate of these methods is very 
slow. The need to centralize this segment of care appears to be very urgent from 
all points of view.
