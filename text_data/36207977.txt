Pancreatic cancer was considered to be one of the contraindications of laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy, but a large number of studies have shown that laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy is safe and feasible for surgeons who have passed the learning curve in high-volume hospitals.Laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy can provide high-resolution intraoperative exploration and unique operative perspective,which can help to reduce intraoperative and postoperative complications,dissect lymph nodes more thoroughly and reduce intraoperative metastasis of tumors,so as to promote the development of postoperative adjuvant therapy and improve patients' quality of life.However,due to the long learning curve and unclear survival outcome, the application of laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy in patients with pancreatic cancer is still controversial.This article summarizes the existing literature and the experience of the author's team,exploring the value and controversy of laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.Further,suggestions are put forward on how to improve the laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy in China.
