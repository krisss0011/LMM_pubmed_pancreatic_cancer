Background:Arterial resection (AR) for pancreatic adenocarcinoma is increasingly considered at specialized centers. We aimed to examine the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of hepatic artery (HA) occlusion after revascularization.Methods:We included patients undergoing HA resection with interposition graft (IG) or primary end-to-end anastomoses (EE). Complete arterial occlusion (CAO) was defined as "early" (EO) or "late" (LO) before/after 90 days respectively. Kaplan-Meier and change-point analysis for CAO was performed.Results:HA resection was performed in 108 patients, IG in 61% (66/108) and EE in 39% (42/108). An equal proportion (50%) underwent HA resection alone or in combination with celiac and/or superior mesenteric artery. CAO was identified in 18% of patients (19/108) with arterial IG least likely to occlude (p=0.019). Hepatic complications occurred in 42% (45/108) and correlated with CAO, symptomatic patients, venous resection, and postoperative portal venous patency. CAO-related operative mortality was 4.6% and significantly higher in EO vs LO (p = 0.046). Median CAO occlusion was 126 days. With change-point analysis, CAO was minimal beyond postoperative day 158.Conclusion:CAO can occur in up to 18% of patients and the first 5-month post-operative period is critical for surveillance. LO is associated with better outcomes compared to EO unless there is inadequate portal venous inflow.
