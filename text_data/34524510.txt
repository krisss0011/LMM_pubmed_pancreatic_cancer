Background and purpose:A new noninvasive biomarker is being sought to predict the prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer. Red-cell volume distribution width (RDW), a descriptive parameter for erythrocyte variation, has been shown to have prognostic value for some tumor types. Our purpose was to assess the RDW value to predict the prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer.Methods:The subjects of this retrospective study were 792 patients who underwent radical surgery for pancreatic cancer, divided into high-RDW and low-RDW groups based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis (15.6%). The controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score was used to assess preoperative nutritional status. Statistical analysis was conducted to investigate the differences between the high and low RDW groups, and to explore the possibility of the RDW being used as prognostic predictor for patients with pancreatic cancer.Results:The immune-nutritional status was worse in the high-RDW group than in the low-RDW group. The high-RDW group patients also had a poorer prognosis. Risk factor analysis showed that the RDW could be an independent risk factor for pancreatic cancer.Conclusions:The RDW is associated with immune-nutritional status in pancreatic cancer patients and can be used as an independent prognostic factor for their postoperative survival.
