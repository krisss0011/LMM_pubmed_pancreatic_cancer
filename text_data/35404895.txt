Objective:The concept of BRCAness has been proposed as a homologous recombination repair dysfunction triggered by a genetic defect in the BRCA pathway including the BRCA1/2 mutations. A certain number of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients have BRCAness. However, a large-scale analysis of BRCAness in PDAC has not been performed. In addition, no basic studies have examined the significance of BRCAness in PDAC cell lines.Methods:Ninety-two patients who underwent surgery for PDAC were enrolled. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded specimens of resected PDACs were used to analyze BRCAness by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. We also analyzed BRCAness in pancreatic cancer cell lines and the sensitivity to cisplatin and olaparib using a colony formation assay.Results:Of the 92 patients with PDAC, 6 were detected to have BRCAness-positive PDAC (6.5%). No significant differences in overall survival and progression-free survival were observed between the BRCAness-positive and BRCAness-negative groups. One PDAC cell line, KP-2, was positive for BRCAness and was more sensitive to cisplatin and olaparib than the BRCAness-negative cell lines.Conclusions:Our results revealed that a considerable number of PDACs are positive for BRCAness, suggesting that BRCAness status could be a useful biomarker for selecting anticancer treatments for advanced or relapsed PDAC.
