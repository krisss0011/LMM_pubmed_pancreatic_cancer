Gemcitabine resistance is a frequently occurring and intractable obstacle in pancreatic cancer treatment. However, the underlying mechanisms require further investigation. Adaptive regulation of oxidative stress and aberrant activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway are associated with resistance to chemotherapy. Here, we found that gemcitabine upregulated the expression of CASC9 in a dose-dependent manner, partially via induction of reactive oxygen species, whereas inhibition of CASC9 expression enhanced gemcitabine-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells. Furthermore, suppression of CASC9 level inhibited the expression of NRF2 and the downstream genes NQO1 and HO-1, and vice versa, indicating that CASC9 forms a positive feedback loop with NRF2 signaling and modulates the level of oxidative stress. Silencing CASC9 attenuated NF-κB pathway activation in pancreatic cancer cells and synergistically enhanced the cytotoxic effect of gemcitabine chemotherapy in vivo. In conclusion, our findings suggest that CASC9 plays a key role in driving resistance to gemcitabine through a reciprocal loop with the NRF2-antioxidant signaling pathway and by activating NF-κB signaling. Our study reveals potential targets that can effectively reverse resistance to gemcitabine chemotherapy.
