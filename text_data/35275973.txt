The upregulation of PODXL and ITGB1 in surgically resected pancreatic cancer tissues is correlated with an unfavorable postoperative prognosis. The aim of this study was to investigate whether PODXL and ITGB1 are useful preoperative markers for the prognosis of postoperative pancreatic cancer patients in comparison with the TNM staging system. Immunohistochemistry was performed using anti-PODXL and anti-ITGB1 antibodies on 24 pancreatic cancer tissue samples preoperatively obtained by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed to investigate if the UICC TNM stage and upregulation of PODXL and ITGB1 were correlated with postoperative overall survival rates. Univariate analysis revealed that PODXL, TNM stage, lymphatic invasion and the combination of PODXL with ITGB1 are correlated with postoperative survival. Multivariate analysis demonstrated TNM stage and the combination of PODXL with ITGB1 to be correlated with postoperative survival, and the combination of PODXL with ITGB1 most accurately predicted the postoperative outcomes of pancreatic cancer patients before resection. Therefore, upregulation of PODXL and ITGB1 may indicate preoperative neoadjuvant therapy for pancreatic cancer patients by accurately predicting the postoperative prognosis.
