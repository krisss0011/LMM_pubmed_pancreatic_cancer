Background/aim:Pancreatic cancer is one of the most devastating malignancies worldwide. Because of the disappointing outcome of traditional treatment, new drug candidates are being investigated. This study analysed the effect of eupatilin on pancreatic cancer cells.Materials and methods:Cell viability assay, western blot, siRNA transfection, 2-deoxyglucose uptake assay, AMP/ADP/ATP assay, and fluorescent activated cell sorting were performed.Results:Eupatilin decreased cell viability and activated AMPK in MIA-PaCa2 cells. Eupatilin decreased glucose uptake in pancreatic cancer, which led to cell starvation and AMPK activation. It is well known that AMPK induces p21 and cell cycle arrest by activating p53. In MIA-PaCa2 cells, p53 is mutated and wild-type p53 protein is suppressed. Treatment with eupatilin induced p21 expression but inhibited the expression of mutated p53. Eupatilin activated Tap73, a p53 family member, which can substitute wild-type p53's role.Conclusion:Eupatilin shows an anticancer effect against pancreatic cancer cells via glucose uptake inhibition, AMPK activation, and cell cycle arrest.
