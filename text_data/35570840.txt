Replicative senescence is irreversible cell proliferation arrest for somatic cells which can be circumvented in cancers. Cellular senescence is a process, which may play two opposite roles. On the one hand, this is a natural protection of somatic cells against unlimited proliferation and malignant transformation. On the other hand, cellular secretion caused by senescence can stimulate inflammation and proliferation of adjacent cells that may promote malignancy. The main genes controlling the senescence pathways are also well known as tumor suppressors. Almost 140 genes regulate both cellular senescence and cancer pathways. About two thirds of these genes (64%) are regulated by microRNAs. Senescence-associated miRNAs can stimulate cancer progression or act as tumor suppressors. Here we review the role playing by senescence-associated miRNAs in development, diagnostics and treatment of pancreatic cancer.
