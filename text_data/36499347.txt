A library of active genome regulatory elements (putative promoters and enhancers) from MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells was constructed using a specially designed lentiviral vector and a massive parallel reporter assay (ChIP-lentiMPRA). Chromatin immunoprecipitation of the cell genomic DNA by H3K27ac antibodies was used for primary enrichment of the library for regulatory elements. Totally, 11,264 unique genome regions, many of which are capable of enhancing the expression of the CopGFP reporter gene from the minimal CMV promoter, were identified. The regions tend to be located near promoters. Based on the proximity assay, we found an enrichment of highly expressed genes among those associated with three or more mapped distal regions (2 kb distant from the 5'-ends of genes). It was shown significant enrichment of genes related to carcinogenesis or Mia PaCa-2 cell identity genes in this group. In contrast, genes associated with 1-2 distal regions or only with proximal regions (within 2 kbp of the 5'-ends of genes) are more often related to housekeeping functions. Thus, ChIP-lentiMPRA is a useful strategy for creating libraries of regulatory elements for the study of tumor-specific gene transcription.
