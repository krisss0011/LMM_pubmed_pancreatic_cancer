Objective:Prospective evaluation of 2 clinical-molecular models in patients with unknown pathology who underwent endoscopic ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) for a cystic lesion of the pancreas.Summary of background data:Preoperative prediction of histologic subtype (mucinous vs nonmucinous) and grade of dysplasia in patients with pancreatic cystic neoplasms is challenging. Our group has previously published 2 clinical-molecular nomograms for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) that incorporated both clinical/radiographic features and cyst fluid protein markers (sFASL, CA72-4, MMP9, IL-4).Methods:This multiinstitutional study enrolled patients who underwent EUS-FNA for a cystic lesion of the pancreas. Treatment recommendations regarding resection were based on standard clinical, radiographic, and endoscopic features. Predicted probabilities of high-risk IPMN (high-grade dysplasia/invasive cancer) were calculated using the previously developed clinical-molecular nomograms.Results:Cyst fluid was obtained from 100 patients who underwent diagnostic EUS-FNA. Within this group there were 35 patients who underwent resection, and 65 were monitored radiographically. Within the group that underwent resection, 26 had low-risk IPMN or benign non-IPMN lesions, and 9 had high-risk IPMN. Within the surveillance group, no patient progressed to resection or developed cancer after a median follow-up of 12months (range: 0.5-38). Using the clinical/radiographic nomogram alone, 2 out of 9 patients with high-risk IPMN had a predicted probability >0.5. In the clinical-molecular models, 6 of 9 patients in model 1, and 6 of 9 in model 2, had scores >0.5.Conclusions:This prospective study of patients with unknown cyst pathology further demonstrates the importance of cyst fluid protein analysis in the preoperative identification of patients with high-risk IPMN. Longer follow-up is necessary to determine if this model will be useful in clinical practice.
