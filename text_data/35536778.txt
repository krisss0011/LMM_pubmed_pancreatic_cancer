Objectives:Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a pivotal role in the immune system and carcinogenesis. There is no research on TLR expression and association with survival among preoperatively treated pancreatic cancer patients. We studied the expression intensity and prognostic value of TLRs in pancreatic cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) and compared the results to patients undergoing upfront surgery (US).Method:Between 2000 and 2015, 71 borderline resectable patients were treated with NAT and surgery and 145 resectable patients underwent upfront surgery at Helsinki University Hospital, Finland. We immunostained TLRs 1-5, 7, and 9 on sections of tissue-microarray. We classified TLR expression as 0 (negative), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (strong) and divided into high (2-3) and low (0-1) expression for statistical purposes.Results:Among TLRs 1, 3, and 9 (TLR1 81% vs 70%, p = 0.008; TLR3 92% vs 68%, p = 0.001; TLR9 cytoplasmic 83% vs 42%, p<0.001; TLR9 membranous 53% vs 25%, p = 0.002) NAT patients exhibited a higher immunopositivity score more frequently than patients undergoing upfront surgery. Among NAT patients, a high expression of TLR1 [Hazards ratio (HR) 0.48, p<0.05] associated with a longer postoperative survival, whereas among US patients, high expression of TLR5 (HR 0.64, p<0.05), TLR7 (HR 0.59, p<0.01, and both TLR7 and TLR9 (HR 0.5, p<0.01) predicted a favorable postoperative outcome in separate analysis adjusted for background variables.Conclusions:We found higher immunopositive intensities among TLRs 1, 3, and 9 in NAT patients. A high TLR1 expression associated with a longer survival among NAT patients, however, among US patients, high expression intensity of TLR5 and TLR7 predicted a favorable postoperative outcome in the adjusted analysis.
