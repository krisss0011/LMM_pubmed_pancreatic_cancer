Hormonal crises are a rare but increasingly recognized phenomenon following peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) in patients with neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs). Due to the paucity of published studies, approaches to the identification, prevention, and management of risk factors are inconsistent between different institutions. This consensus statement aimed to provide guidance for NEN patients undergoing PRRT. Our statement has been created on the basis of clinical demand and concerns regarding the precipitation of hormonal crises. A formal literature review was conducted to identify available studies. A total of 19 Australian and New Zealand experts in the fields of medical oncology, nuclear medicine, anaesthetics, and endocrinology collaborated on this consensus statement. The main focus is on carcinoid crises. Other hormonal crises seen in patients with functional pancreatic NENs are addressed briefly. These recommendations are relevant to PRRT centres internationally and should be tailored to local experience and available resources.
