Background:Only two clinical trials have shown the effects of neoadjuvant treatment for borderline resectable pancreatic cancer with arterial involvement (BRPC-A). Here, we aimed to analyze the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel (GnP) for BRPC-A.Patients and methods:A prospective, single-arm, multicenter phase II trial was conducted. Patients who were radiologically and histologically diagnosed with BRPC-A were enrolled. A central review was conducted to confirm the presence of BRPC-A. Patients received two to four cycles of GnP before surgery. The primary endpoint of the study was the R0 resection rate. Overall survival (OS) was evaluated in an ancillary study.Results:Thirty-five patients were enrolled, of whom 33 were subjected to central review and 28 were confirmed to have BRPC-A. All eligible patients with BRPC-A received neoadjuvant GnP. Nineteen patients underwent pancreatic resections. Postoperative complications of Clavien-Dindo IIIa or lower were observed in 11 patients. No treatment-related mortalities were observed. R0 resection was achieved in 17 patients (89%); the R0 resection rate was 61% in eligible patients. One patient underwent curative resection after termination of the treatment protocol, resulting in an overall R0 resection rate of 64%. The median overall survival (OS) and 2-year OS rate were 24.9 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 19.0 months to not estimatable] and 53.6%, respectively. OS in patients with BRPC-A who achieved overall R0 resection was significantly longer than that in the other patients (p = 0.0255).Conclusions:Neoadjuvant GnP is a safe and effective strategy for BRPC-A, providing a chance for curative resection and improved survival.
