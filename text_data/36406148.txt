Aim:The aim of this study is to identify cuproptosis-related lncRNAs and construct a prognostic model for pancreatic cancer patients for clinical use.Methods:The expression profile of lncRNAs was downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas database, and cuproptosis-related lncRNAs were identified. The prognostic cuproptosis-related lncRNAs were obtained and used to establish and validate a prognostic risk score model in pancreatic cancer.Results:In total, 181 cuproptosis-related lncRNAs were obtained. The prognostic risk score model was constructed based on five lncRNAs (AC025257.1, TRAM2-AS1, AC091057.1, LINC01963, and MALAT1). Patients were assigned to two groups according to the median risk score. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that the difference in the prognosis between the high- and low-risk groups was statistically significant. Multivariate Cox analysis showed that our risk score was an independent risk factor for pancreatic cancer patients. Receiver operator characteristic curves revealed that the cuproptosis-related lncRNA model can effectively predict the prognosis of pancreatic cancer. The principal component analysis showed a difference between the high- and low-risk groups intuitively. Functional enrichment analysis showed that different genes were involved in cancer-related pathways in patients in the high- and low-risk groups.Conclusion:The risk model based on five prognostic cuproptosis-related lncRNAs can well predict the prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients. Cuproptosis-related lncRNAs could be potential biomarkers for pancreatic cancer diagnosis and treatment.
