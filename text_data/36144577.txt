Pancreatic cancer has an extremely poor prognosis, and the clinical drugs for the treatment of pancreatic cancer are usually multi-drug combinations. Therefore, it is necessary to search for and find specific new bioactive agents against pancreatic cancer. Carabrone is a carabrane-type sesquiterpenolide extracted fromCarpesium cernuumL., and this natural compound has been reported to be a potential anti-tumor agent. However, there are few reports on the function of carabrone related to anti-tumor activity in pancreatic cancer. Herein, cell experiments indicated that carabrone had anti-proliferation inhibition and anti-migration and anti-invasion activity against SW1990 cells. Furthermore, the tandem mass spectrometry and network pharmacology analysis showed that this activity may be related to the ferroptosis and Hippo signaling pathway. Taken together, our results demonstrated that carabrone exhibited prominent anti-pancreatic cancer activity and could be a promising agent against pancreatic cancer.
