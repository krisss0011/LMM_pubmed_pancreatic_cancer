Background/aim:This study evaluated the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) for intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma (IPMC).Patients and methods:We retrospectively analyzed patients who underwent pancreatectomy for invasive IPMC from January 2007 to June 2020. We evaluated outcomes of AC in the entire cohort and in patients with known prognostic factors.Results:A total of 51 patients with invasive IPMC underwent surgery, of which 35 received AC. In the entire cohort, there was no significant difference in median overall survival (OS) between the AC and surgery alone (SA) group [hazard ratio (HR)=0.54; p=0.232]. For patients with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, median OS was significantly longer in the AC group (HR=0.27; p=0.022). For patients with lymph node metastasis, median OS was significantly higher in the AC group (HR=0.07; p<0.001).Conclusion:AC may be effective for selected invasive IPMC patients.
