Solid pseudopapillary pancreatic neoplasms are rare. The male-to-female ratio is 1:9, and metastasis occurs only in a few cases. A 39-year-old male with a solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN) with lymph node metastasis underwent ultrasonography, CT, and MRI, which revealed a mass (8 cm) in the pancreatic head. Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET showed a hypermetabolic lymph node in the root area of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). The patient underwent pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy, which confirmed a peripancreatic lymph node metastasis. The lymph node of the SMA root area remained because of the encasing of the superior mesenteric artery. After 14 months of follow-up (with no adjuvant therapy initiated), the residual metastatic lymph nodes showed no change and no recurrence. In conclusion, surgery of the primary tumor for patients with SPN is recommended, even in cases with metastatic lymph nodes remaining.
