Approximately 90% of pancreatic cancers are pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC). PDAC is the fourth leading cause of cancer death world-wide. Therapies for PDAC are largely ineffective due to the dense desmoplastic tumor microenvironment which prevents chemotherapeutic drugs and small molecule inhibitors from exerting effective anti-cancer effects. In this review, we will discuss the roles of TP53 and miRs on the PDAC tumor microenvironment and how loss of the normal functions of TP53 promote tumor progression. TheTP53gene is mutated in approximately 50% of pancreatic cancers. Often, these TP53 mutations are point mutations which confer additional functions for the TP53 proteins. These are called gain of function (GOF) mutations (mut). Another class of TP53 mutations are deletions which result in loss of the TP53 protein; these are referred to TP53-null mutations. We have organized this review into various components/properties of the PDAC microenvironment and how they may be altered in the presence of mutant TP53 and loss of certain miR expression.
