A 53-year-old woman underwent subtotal stomach-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy(SSPPD)for resectable pancreatic cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Postoperatively, she received hepatic arterial infusion of 5-FU and S-1 chemotherapy. Two years after SSPPD, abdominal computed tomography showed a 2-cm mass in the remnant pancreas, which was diagnosed as recurrence of cancer by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration. Staging laparoscopy was performed and peritoneal washing cytology(CY)was positive. She then received gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy for 8 months. After that, staging laparoscopy was performed again and negative CY was confirmed. A total remnant pancreatectomy with splenectomy was performed. She received chemotherapy after pancreatectomy and is now alive and well without recurrence 2 years and 1 month after the second surgery. Although positive CY is a poor prognostic factor, surgery combined with perioperative chemotherapy may contribute to prolonged survival for some patients who have recurrence in the remnant pancreas with positive CY.
