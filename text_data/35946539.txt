Pancreatic giant cell tumors (PGCTs), undifferentiated pancreatic carcinoma are rare tumors of the pancreas. PGCTs consist of osteoclastic, pleomorphic and mixed variants. PGCT is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage. PGCT has a worse prognosis than pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Although surgery can be curative, there is no standard treatment approach for advanced PGCT. We present a case of PGCT that is resistant to standard therapy and progresses in a short time.
