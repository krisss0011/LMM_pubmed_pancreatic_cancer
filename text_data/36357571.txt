Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) are key to the treatment-refractory desmoplastic phenotype of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and have received considerable attention as a stromal target for cancer therapy. This approach demands detailed understanding of their pro- and anti-tumourigenic effects. Interrogating PSC-cancer cell interactions in 3D models, we identified nuclear FGFR1 as critical for PSC-led invasion of cancer cells. ChIP-seq analysis of FGFR1 in PSCs revealed a number of FGFR1 interaction sites within the genome, notably NRG1, which encodes the ERBB ligand Neuregulin. We show that nuclear FGFR1 regulates transcription of NRG1, which in turn acts in autocrine fashion through an ERBB2/4 heterodimer to promote invasion. In support of this, recombinant NRG1 in 3D model systems rescued the loss of invasion incurred by FGFR inhibition. In vivo we demonstrate that, while FGFR inhibition does not affect the growth of pancreatic tumours in mice, local invasion into the pancreas is reduced. Thus, FGFR and NRG1 may present new stromal targets for PDAC therapy.
