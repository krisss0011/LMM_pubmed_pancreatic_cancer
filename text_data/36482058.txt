Background:Pancreatic cancer is despite modern diagnostic tools and treatment regimen associated with poor outcome. Many patients show cachexia and sarcopenia.Methods:In a retrospective analysis the SMI (cm²/m²) was measured by determining the skelettal muscle area in a computed tomography image at lumbar vertebrae 3. Further clinical parameters were measured to determine the outcome.Results:The mean survival after diagnosis in the population with sarcopenia was significantly lower (14,4 vs 17,7 months, p=0,046). Significantly shorter survival was also seen for higher age (p=0,006), no tumor resection (p=0,004), metastases (p=0,002) and high CA19-9 level (p=0,002) CONCLUSION: Sarcopenia is an indipendant prognostic factor in patients with pancreatic cancer. SMI should be measured clinical practice and further studies are necessary to asses a potential therapeutic strategy.
