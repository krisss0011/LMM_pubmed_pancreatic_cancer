Galectins have been linked to tumorigenesis since 1975, even before this family of proteins was given its name. Since then, hundreds of papers have analyzed the role of different galectins in cancer development and progression, deciphering their involvement in many different pathological events, from the regulation of cell cycle, to angiogenesis, metastasis, and immune attack evasion. Importantly, the tumor galectin profile is often altered in many cancers and aberrant levels of some of the members of this family have been considered in diagnosis and frequently correlated with patient prognosis and clinicopathological characteristics. In this chapter, we summarize most frequent techniques employed in cancer research to interrogate the role of galectins, using Gal-1 to illustrate one member of the family and pancreatic cancer as an experimental model. We will cover from techniques employed to detect their expression (tissue and blood samples) to the most frequent tools used to change expression levels and the cell line-based in vitro studies and murine preclinical models used to explore their role in tumor progression and/or clinical translation.
