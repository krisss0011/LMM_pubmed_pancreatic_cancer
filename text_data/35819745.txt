Loss of function in the BRCA2 gene exacerbates ovarian, breast, and pancreatic ductal cancer risk. Despite being implicated in the pancreatic ductal epithelium carcinogenesis, the involvement of a germline BRCA2 mutation in acinar and endocrine cells is less reported. A 45-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer was referred to our hospital for a detailed examination of epigastric pain. Her father had pancreatic cancer, and her paternal aunt had a history of breast cancer. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a round tumor with a contrast effect in the pancreatic head. The patient underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy, and postoperative pathology and genetic testing revealed amphicrine-type mixed acinar-neuroendocrine carcinoma with a germline BRCA2 mutation. Recent studies have reported the BRCA2 mutation in genome sequencing of pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma and neuroendocrine tumor; perhaps, genetic testing for the BRCA2 mutation is feasible for patients with mixed neuroendocrine-non-neuroendocrine neoplasm.
