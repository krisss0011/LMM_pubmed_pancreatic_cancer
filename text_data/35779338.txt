Background:PALB2 (BRCA2 partner and localizer) is a BRCA2-interacting protein that is required for BRCA2 genome caretaker tasks and interacts with BRCA1. Women with PALB2 mutation have a 40% to 60% higher risk of breast cancer, almost equivalent to women who have BRCA mutations. PALB2 mutation may also increase the risk of pancreatic cancer. New guidelines for PALB2 mutation in breast cancer advise pancreatic cancer screening, which includes M.R.I.s of the pancreas as well as endoscopic ultrasonography, for women who have a family history of pancreatic cancer. Using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and The Human Protein Atlas we examined genes that co-express with PALB2 in breast and pancreatic cancer.Methods:We used cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics to analyze data in TCGA. cBioPortal provides visualization, analysis and download of large-scale cancer genomics data sets. We used the UCSC Xena Browser to additionally analyze gene expression in TCGA.Results:Six genes, EARS2, ARL6IP1, DNAJA3, KNOP1, RPUSD1, and TMEM186, significantly coexpressed with PALB2 in both breast and pancreatic cancer. Glutamyl-tRNA synthetase 2 (EARS2) was the only gene coexpressing with PALB2 in the breast and pancreatic cancer subjects that was significantly related to pancreatic cancer survival. Elevated PALB2 and EARS2 gene expression are both significantly associated with the PAM50 Luminal B subtype and high risk of recurrence, suggesting why these women may need active intervention, such as prophylactic mastectomy.Conclusions:EARS2 expression might be a risk factor for pancreatic cancer in breast cancer patients with PALB2 mutations. By assessing EARS2 expression in breast tumors, the clinician might obtain a second piece of information that, with family history of pancreatic cancer, could inform the decision to perform pancreatic cancer screening.
