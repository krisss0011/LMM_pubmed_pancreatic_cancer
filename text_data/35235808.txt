Gα13 transduces signals from G-protein-coupled receptors. While Gα13 functions as a tumor suppressor in lymphomas, it is not known whether Gα13 is pro-tumorigenic or tumor suppressive in genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models of epithelial cancers. Here, we show that loss of Gα13 in the Kras/Tp53 (KPC) GEM model promotes well-differentiated tumors and reduces survival. Mechanistically, tumors developing in KPC mice with Gα13 loss exhibit increased E-cadherin expression and mTOR signaling. Importantly, human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumors with low Gα13 expression also exhibit increased E-cadherin expression and mTOR signaling. Treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin decreases the growth of syngeneic KPC tumors with Gα13 loss by promoting cell death. This work establishes a tumor-suppressive role of Gα13 in pancreatic tumorigenesis in the KPC GEM model and suggests targeting mTOR in human PDAC tumors with Gα13 loss.
