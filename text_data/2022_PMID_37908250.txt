We describe a patient with acromegaly presenting in diabetic ketoacidosis who 
was able to achieve euglycemia despite discontinuation of all antihyperglycemic 
therapy prior to surgical or medical treatment for his acromegaly. No previous 
cases of acromegaly presenting in diabetic ketoacidosis have reported glycemic 
normalization without antihyperglycemic therapy prior to acromegaly treatment. 
Our case highlights this unique outcome and postulates that pancreatic β-cell 
resiliency may be influential on insulin resistance since our patient achieved 
euglycemia despite a persistent state of excess growth hormone and insulin-like 
growth factor-1. Our case further emphasizes that consideration for acromegaly 
should be given in patients presenting with severe insulin resistance and 
pertinent medical history and physical examination features, and it emphasizes 
the dramatic range of insulin requirements in patients with acromegaly.
