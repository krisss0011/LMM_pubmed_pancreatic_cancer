Chronic inflammation is known to be associated with pancreatic cancer, however a complete picture regarding how these pathologies intersect is still being characterized. In vivo model systems are critical for the study of mechanisms underlying how inflammation accelerates neoplasia. Repeat injection of cerulein, a cholecystokinin (CCK) analog, is widely used to experimentally induce acute and chronic pancreatitis in vivo. Chronic cerulein administration into genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) with predisposition to pancreatic cancer can induce a pro-inflammatory immune response, pancreatic acinar cell damage, pancreatic stellate cell activation, and accelerate the onset of neoplasia. Here we provide a detailed protocol and insights into using cerulein to induce pancreatitis in GEMMs, and methods to experimentally assess inflammation and pancreatic neoplasia.
