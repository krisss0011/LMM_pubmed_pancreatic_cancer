Extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from cells into the blood facilitate intercellular communication and serve as new biomarkers to understand the pathophysiology of several conditions. Although the importance of the cargo inside EVs has been extensively studied, the sizes of EVs that vary with different types of cancers are relatively poorly explored. Here, we show that pancreatic cancer cell-derived EVs are significantly smaller than non-cancer cell-derived EVs. The smaller size distribution of these EVs was confirmed by specifically isolating and examining tumor-derived EVs from the heterogeneous EV population isolated from the sera of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. In vitro analyses mimicking tumor microenvironment conditions revealed that low glucose conditions reduced the size distribution and increased the level of unsaturated fatty acids in the tumor-derived EVs. Because the lipid composition defines the fluidity of the membrane, the results suggest that the alterations in the size of EVs could be due to the alteration of the fluidity and stability of the membrane covering the EVs. Furthermore, the uptake of smaller EVs by recipient cells was increased, which may lead to enhanced functional results. These results provide fundamental insights into the factors defining the size of EVs, which may be important for developing cancer screening methods and understanding cancer-related pathophysiology.
