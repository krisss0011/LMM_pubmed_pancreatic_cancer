The case was a 70-year-old man of highly advanced gastric cancer with 2 liver 
metastases(S3, S8)and pancreatic invasion. Three courses of S-1 plus L-OHP(SOX 
therapy)were performed, and total gastrectomy and combined resection of the 
spleen and body and tail of the pancreas and partial resection of the liver S3 
and S8 were performed after reduction of primary tumor and liver metastasis. S-1 
therapy was continued for 1 year as postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. Left 
adrenal metastasis was detected by CT, 1 year and 6 months after the operation. 
PET-CT revealed no other areas suspected of recurrence, so left adrenalectomy 
was performed through the retroperitoneal space. Radical resection was not 
achieved because adhesions and scarring from the previous surgery were severe. 
Paclitaxel plus Ramucirumab was started and after 10 courses, the disappearance 
of the tumor shadow was observed on enhanced CT, and PET-CT. Three years and 3 
months after the initial surgery and 1 year and 8 months after resection of 
adrenal metastasis, the patient is alive without recurrence.
