Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) and mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs) are all considered "Pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCNs)" and show a varying risk of developing into pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). These lesions display different molecular characteristics, mutations, and clinical manifestations. A lack of detailed understanding of PCN subtype characteristics and their molecular mechanisms limits the development of efficient diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies for these lesions. Proper in vivo mouse models that mimic human PCNs are also needed to study the molecular mechanisms and for therapeutic testing. A comprehensive understanding of the current status of PCN biology, mechanisms, current diagnostic methods, and therapies will help in the early detection and proper management of patients with these lesions and PDAC. This review aims to describe all these aspects of PCNs, specifically IPMNs, by describing the future perspectives.
