Context.—:Although most pancreatic and bile duct neoplasms are solid, mucinous cystic neoplasms and intraductal neoplasms have been increasingly recognized even when clinically silent, thanks to the increased use of sensitive imaging techniques. Cystic and intraductal neoplasms of the pancreas are often resectable and curable and constitute about 5% of all pancreatic neoplasms. Owing to their preinvasive nature and different biology, recognition of these entities remains a major priority. Mucinous cystic neoplasms are histologically and clinically distinct from other cystic pancreatic neoplasms. Pancreatic intraductal neoplasms encompass 3 major entities: intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm, intraductal oncocytic papillary neoplasm, and intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm. Intraductal papillary neoplasms of bile ducts are also preinvasive mass-forming neoplasms with both similarities and differences with their pancreatic counterparts. All of these pancreatobiliary neoplasms have diverse and distinctive clinicopathologic, genetic, and prognostic variations.Objective.—:To review the clinical, pathologic, and molecular features of mucinous cystic and intraductal neoplasms of the pancreatobiliary tract.Data sources.—:Literature review, diagnostic manuals, and guidelines.Conclusions.—:This review will briefly describe well-known clinical and pathologic features and will focus on selected recently described aspects of morphology, grading, classification, and genomic alterations of cystic and intraductal neoplasms of the pancreatobiliary tract.
