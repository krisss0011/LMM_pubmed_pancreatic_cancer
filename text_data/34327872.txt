Background:Expression of human equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1 (hENT1) is reported to predict survival of gemcitabine (GEM)-treated patients. However, predictive values of immunohistochemical hENT1 expression may differ according to the antibodies, 10D7G2 and SP120.Aim:We aimed to investigate the concordance of immunohistochemical hENT1 expression between the two antibodies and prognosis.Methods:The subjects of this study were totally 332 whose formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens and/or unstained sections were obtained. The individual H-scores and four classifications according to the staining intensity were applied for the evaluation of hENT1 expression by 10D7G2 and SP120, respectively.Results:The highest concordance rate (79.8%) was obtained when the cut-off between high and low hENT1 expression using SP120 was set between moderate and strong. There were no correlations of hENT1 mRNA level with H-score (p = .258). Although the hENT1 mRNA level was significantly different among four classifications using SP120 (p = .011), there was no linear relationship among them. Multivariate analyses showed that adjuvant GEM was a significant predictor of the patients with low hENT1 expression using either 10D7G2 (Hazard ratio [HR] 2.39, p = .001) or SP120 (HR 1.84, p < .001). In contrast, agent for adjuvant chemotherapy was not significant predictor for the patients with high hENT1 expression regardless of the kind of antibody.Conclusion:The present study suggests that the two antibodies for evaluating hENT1 expression are equivalent depending on the cut-off point and suggests that S-1 is the first choice of adjuvant chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer with low hENT1 expression, whereas either S-1 or GEM can be introduced for the pancreatic cancer with high hENT1 expression, no matter which antibody is used.
