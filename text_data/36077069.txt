Pancreatic cancer (PC) has a high mortality rate due to its poor prognosis and the possibility of surgical resection in patients with the disease. Importantly, adjuvant chemotherapy is necessary to improve PC prognosis. Chrysin, a natural product with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer properties, has been studied for several years. Our previous study demonstrated that chrysin induced G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) expression and regulated its activity in breast cancer. Herein, we investigated whether chrysin-induced GPER activation suppresses PC progression in MIA PaCa-2 cells and a xenograft model. To determine its mechanism of action, cytotoxicity and clonogenic assays, a FACS analysis, and Western blotting were performed. Furthermore, the delay in tumor growth was evaluated in the MIA PaCa-2-derived xenograft model. Tumor tissues were investigated by Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and a proteomic analysis. Chrysin caused cell cycle arrest and significantly decreased cell viability. Following co-treatment with chrysin and 17Î²-estradiol, the inhibitory effect of chrysin on cell proliferation was enhanced. In the xenograft model, chrysin and G1 (a GPER agonist) significantly delayed tumor growth and reduced both Ki-67 (a proliferation marker) and c-Myc expressions in tumor tissues. The proteomic analysis of tumor tissues identified that rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK1), transgelin 2 (TAGLN2), and FCH and Mu domain containing endocytic adaptor 2 (FCHO2) levels were significantly reduced in chrysin-treated tumor tissues. HighROCK1,TAGLN2, andFCHO2expressions were indicative of low overall PC survival as found using the Kaplan-Meier plotter. In conclusion, our results suggest that chrysin suppresses PC progression through the activation of GPER and reductions in ROCK1, TAGLN2, and FCHO2 expressions.
