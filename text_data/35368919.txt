Background:Pancreatic cancer (PC) stands out as one of the most lethal cancers. Due to late diagnosis, only a fraction of patients can be resected. Although it still has significant adverse effects and poor results, the treatment is connected with better overall survival than the prior treatment. Thus, new alternative therapy for advanced PC is needed.Materials/Methods. The impact of 10058-F4 and curcumin combination therapy on apoptosis and cell growth in SW1990 pancreatic cancer cells were determined in vitro using the CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry of Annexin V-FITC/PI, and the in vivo antitumor effect was determined utilizing SW1990-bearing pancreatic tumor mouse models induced by subcutaneous implantation.Results:At concentrations of (10 mol/L+2 mol/L), 10058-F4+curcumin obtained the highest rate of SW1990 cell death, and they had a beneficial effect on SW1990 pancreatic tumor-bearing animals. Furthermore, c-Myc, Akt phosphorylation, and the expression of apoptosis-related molecular were reduced, and the combination therapy modified the expression of apoptosis-related molecular.Conclusions:In vitro and in vivo, the combination of 10058-F4 plus curcumin has antipancreatic cancer actions that are substantially effective.
