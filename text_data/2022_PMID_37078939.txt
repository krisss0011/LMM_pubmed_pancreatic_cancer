OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to compare the efficacy and safety of 3 
chemotherapy regimens used as first-line treatments in the real-life management 
of metastatic pancreatic cancer.
METHODS: A total of 218 patients were included in this multicenter study. 
Gemcitabine (Gem, n = 71), gemcitabine-cisplatin (Gem-Cis, n = 91), and 
FOLFIRINOX (a combination of leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan, and 
oxaliplatin [FFX], n = 56) treatments were compared.
RESULTS: Overall response rate was significantly higher in the FFX group (50.0%) 
than in the Gem (28.2%) and Gem-Cis (27.5%) groups (P = 0.010). Median 
progression-free survival (8.4 vs 4.6 and 5.5 months, respectively, P < 0.001) 
and overall survival (16.4 vs 8.1 and 8.7 months, respectively, P = 0.002) were 
significantly longer in the FFX group than in the Gem and Gem-Cis groups. 
Toxicity of any grade was noted in 46 (64.8%), 56 (61.5%), and 49 (87.5%) 
patients in the Gem, Gem-Cis, and FFX groups, respectively (P = 0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: In our study, FFX regimen provides a significant advantage over the 
other treatment regimens in terms of response rates and survival. Treatment 
toxicity was more frequent but manageable with the FFX regimen.
