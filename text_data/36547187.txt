Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is still hampered by a dismal prognosis. A better understanding of the tumor microenvironment within the pancreas and of the factors affecting its composition is of utmost importance for developing new diagnostic and treatment tools. In this context, the complement system plays a prominent role. Not only has it been shown to shape a T cell-mediated immune response, but it also directly affects proliferation and apoptosis of the tumor cells, influencing angiogenesis, metastatic spread and therapeutic resistance. This makes complement proteins appealing not only as early biomarkers of PDAC development, but also as therapeutic targets. Fungal dysbiosis is currently the new kid on the block in tumorigenesis with cancer-associated mycobiomes extracted from several cancer types. For PDAC, colonization with the yeast Malassezia seems to promote cancer progression, already in precursor lesions. One responsible mechanism appears to be complement activation via the lectin pathway. In the present article, we review the role of the complement system in tumorigenesis, presenting observations that propose it as the missing link between fungal dysbiosis and PDAC development. We also present the results of a small pilot study supporting the crucial interplay between the complement system and Malassezia colonization in PDAC pathogenesis.
