Abstract
Background— Poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer (PanCa) is associated with lack of an 
effective early diagnostic biomarker. This study elucidates significance of MUC13, as a 
diagnostic/prognostic marker of PanCa.
Methods— MUC13 was assessed in tissues using our in-house generated anti-MUC13 mouse 
monoclonal antibody and analyzed for clinical correlation by immunohistochemistry, 
immunoblotting, RT-PCR, computational and submicron scale mass-density fluctuation analyses, 
ROC and Kaplan Meir curve analyses.
Results— MUC13 expression was detected in 100% pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) 
lesions (Mean composite score: MCS=5.8; AUC >0.8, P<0.0001), 94.6% of pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) samples (MCS=9.7, P<0.0001) as compared to low expression in tumor 
adjacent tissues (MCS=4, P<0.001) along with faint or no expression in normal pancreatic tissues 
(MCS=0.8; AUC >0.8; P<0.0001). Nuclear MUC13 expression positively correlated with nodal 
metastasis ( P<0.05), invasion of cancer to peripheral tissues ( P<0.5) and poor patient survival 
(P<0.05; prognostic AUC=0.9). Submicron scale mass density and artificial intelligence based 
algorithm analyses also elucidated association of MUC13 with greater morphological disorder 
(P<0.001)  and nuclear MUC13 as strong predictor for cancer aggressiveness and poor patient 
survival.
Conclusion— This study provides significant information regarding MUC13 expression/
subcellular localization in PanCa samples and supporting the use anti-MUC13 MAb for the 
development of PanCa diagnostic/prognostic test.

INTRODUCTION
By 2030, pancreatic cancer (PanCa) is projected to be the second leading cause of cancer 
related deaths 1. The early diagnosis of PanCa remains a clinical challenge, predominantly 
due the lack of effective diagnostic biomarkers. Therefore, the scientific community is 
making tremendous efforts toward identification of novel early diagnostic markers, as 
existing biomarkers, including CA19-9 have yielded only suboptimal efficacy in early stage 
detection 2.
Recent studies have suggested that high expression of MUC13, a newly identified epithelial 
cell surface mucin, in PanCa and the overexpression of MUC13 in PanCa cells leads to 
enhanced tumorigenic and metastatic phenotypes. These characteristics of PanCa cells are 
mediated by physical interactions between MUC13 and HER2/Neu 3–5. Additionally, Khan et al. Page 2

microRNA-145 (miR-145) 5, while the restitution of miR-145 inhibits MUC13 expression 
and pancreatic tumor growth 6. In addition to our previous studies 3–5, the potential role of 
MUC13 in pancreatic pathophysiology has also been recognized by other institutions.
In this study, we have performed a comprehensive investigation of MUC13 expression using 
our newly generated anti-MUC13 monoclonal antibody (Mab) in a large cohort of human 
PanCa tissue samples. The expression pattern and subcellular localization of MUC13 was 
correlated with each patient’s clinical course to determine its diagnostic and/or prognostic 
significance. Based on our previous observations, we hypothesized that MUC13 expression 
could be detected in precursor lesions (i.e. PanIN).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Human pancreatic cancer tissues
Tissue microarrays (TMAs) were obtained from multiple sources: TMA#Baptist-UTHSC 
(normal pancreatic tissue, tumor-adjacent normal pancreas, PanIN, pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma [PDAC], other PanCa types) was obtained from Baptist Memorial Hospital 
(BMH), Memphis, TN; TMA#PA2012 (PDAC and other control organs) from the University 
of Nebraska Medical Center; TMA#642 (multiple types of invasive PanCa with normal 
pancreas) from Johns Hopkins; OD-CT-DgPan03-001 (PDAC), BIC14011 (PanIN, PanCa), 
PA241b (PDAC with matched normal adjacent tissue [NAT]), T141a (PanCa tissue), HPan-
Ade150CS-01 (PDAC and matched NAT), PA961b (PDAC) and HPan-Ade180Sur-01 
(PDAC with matched NAT) were obtained from US Biomax, Inc. (Derwood, MD, USA). 
Additionally, fresh pancreatic tissue samples were procured from BMH including PanCa 
with matched NAT. The institutional review boards at UTHSC and BMH approved this 
study.
PDAC cell lines and culture conditions
PDAC cells were obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection). We generated 
MUC13 knock-down PDAC (sh-M13), MUC13 vector (sh-V) stable cell lines using HPAF-
II cells; and ectopically expressing MUC13 (M13) and vector (V) stable cell lines using 
Panc-1 cells3. The cells were cultured in DMEM, RPMI or DME/F12 media supplemented 
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2 in air at 
37°C.
RT-PCR for MUC13 mRNA
RNA was extracted from fresh tissues using RNeasy Midi Kit (catalog number 75144, 
Qiagen). The relative expression levels of MUC13 mRNA were assessed by Semi - 
quantitative RT-PCR 8 using sequence-specific primers: MUC13 fwd: 
CCTTCGGTGTGATTATTATGGC, MUC13 rev: GCATCTGGCTGTCTCTGGAG.
Immunoblotting for MUC13 protein
The protein from tumor tissues was isolated as described before 8 and processed for 
immunoblotting as described previously 8, 9.Khan et al. Page 3
HPB (Oxford) . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 June 01.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptImmunohistochemistry for MUC13 expression
MUC13 expression was detected by immunohistochemical staining using a commercially 
available kit (Biocare Medical) as described before 5, 10, 11. Briefly, tissue sections were 
deparaffinized and rehydrated using different grades of alcohol followed by endogenous 
peroxidase quenching. Blocking and incubation with mouse monoclonal MUC13 antibody 
(produced in our lab) 3, 5, 12, 13 was then completed overnight. These antibodies exhibit high 
specificity and an intense reactivity with PDAC tissues in vitro  and in vivo  (xenograft mice-
data not shown). The sections were then incubated with secondary MACH4 Universal HRP 
mouse polymer (#M4U534H) followed by staining with 3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) 
chromogen (#DB801) and counterstaining with hematoxylin.
Scoring of MUC13 expression in stained pancreatic normal and cancerous tissues
After histochemical labeling, slides were digitally scanned and analyzed for MUC13 
staining at the UTHSC Pathology Department. Blinded to the patient’s history, captured 
images were independently analyzed by three reviewers (N.Z, S.K, and S.C.C) and a 
consensus scoring was deduced as described earlier 14. The intensity of immunoreactivity of 
the MUC13 was graded on a 0 to 4 scale (0 for no staining, 1 for weak immunoreactivity; 2 
for moderate immunoreactivity; 3 for strong immunoreactivity, and 4 for very strong 
immunoreactivity. The percentage of cells positive for MUC13 immunoreactivity within the 
tumor and adjacent normal tissue sections were scored as follows: 0–25% as 1, 26–50% as 
2, 51–75% as 3 and 76–100% as 4. Acellular or stromal tissues were not scored, nor were 
neighboring acinar cells with negligible or no staining. Staining of uninvolved adjacent ducts 
was used to represent MUC13 expression in matched NAT for PDAC cases. The composite 
score (CS) values ranging from 0–16, were calculated by multiplying the value for staining 
intensity (0 – 4) and the percentage of immunoreactive cells (0 – 4) for each individual 
sample. Finally, the mean composite score (MCS) was determined by calculating an average 
of the composite scores of respective samples in each category.
Computational analysis for best feature selection
Computational analysis was utilized to better understand the role of MUC13 in predicting 
cancer aggressiveness and patient survival by defining strong determining features. The 
artificial intelligence techniques like ‘Best Fit’ filter method and the wrapper method of 
‘Genetic Algorithm’ have been extensively described for best feature selection in the 
diagnosis of cancers15–17. Best Fit selects the first best attribute or feature set for further 
consideration whereas the Genetic Algorithm randomly searches every possible attribute or 
feature set with strong features. For evaluation of feature sets, we have additionally used a 
Neural Network classifier or a learner to identify the category or class to which an 
observation or instance belongs18, 19 depending upon the training validation and testing set 
provided to the classifier.
Quantification of spatial submicron scale mass density fluctuations associated with 
MUC13

confocal DAPI images of nuclei, we generated mass arrays and dielectric arrays in order to 
obtain normal modes of light waves to quantify the degree of the morphological distortion, 
Lmd with respect to the presence or absence of MUC13 staining in different areas within the 
samples or in contrast to the distinct samples as described before 20–22. Lmd stands for local 
mass distortion/variation m and lc for corresponding spatial correlation decay length23. For 
the statistical analysis, we took confocal micrographs of cells and tumor samples (n=20) 
from each type.
Statistical Analysis
The means of two groups were compared using a Students-t test, with P-values <0.05 
considered statistically significant. Box plots were used to analyze data and generated using 
Sigma plot 12.0. For the computational analysis, the Mean Squared Error (MSE) was 
calculated as the average of the squares of the errors or deviations wherein the error is the 
difference between the expected and observed value. For immunostaining, MUC13 
expression, represented by the MCS, was determined for the membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus, 
and overall (overall intensity x overall percentage staining). The MCS was compared among 
groups and the effects of MUC13 expression in conjunction with stage, grade, and long-term 
outcomes were studied. The ability of MUC13 to differentiate PDAC patients from the 
control groups (healthy control: HC and Chronic pancreatitis: CP patients for the initial 
study) was determined by analyzing the area under the curve (AUC; denotes the probability 
that the time-to-event is improved in one arm compared to the other) using ROC curve 
analysis. In multivariate analysis of these variables adjusted for overall (overall intensity x 
overall percentage staining) and MCS Nucleus, Cox Proportional Hazards model was used. 
Results were summarized with hazard ratios and confidence intervals. All analyses were 
done using SAS 9.4 (SAS institute Inc., Cary, NC) 24.
RESULTS
Progressive increase of MUC13 in PanIN lesions
Tissues were immunostained for MUC13, including normal pancreas (n=13), chronic 
pancreatitis (n= 12), early-stage PanIN (n=16; PanIN-1A and PanIN-IB) and late-stage 
PanIN (n=13; PanIN-II and PanIN-III) (Supplementary Table 1). Normal pancreatic ducts 
showed no or very faint MUC13 expression, whereas, all of early (16 of 16) and late-stage 
PanINs (13 of 13) showed low to moderate MUC13 expression (Fig. 1A and Inset-1). 
MUC13 expression was predominantly at the apical side and less at the basal side of the 
epithelial cells in case of PanIN I/II, while, PanIN III samples showed staining all over the 
cell throughout lesions. Overall, MUC13 expression was significantly ( p<0.0001) higher in 
PanINs compared to normal pancreatic ductal epithelium (Fig. 1B). Additionally, we 
analyzed changes in the subcellular localization of MUC13 in PanINs and observed a 
progressively increased MUC13 expression in the membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus, during 
the course of progression from PanIN-I to PanIN-III (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Figure 1A 
and B). We evaluated the lesion scores in two ways; Composite score (CS; taking in account 
of each case individually) and MCS (mean composite score) of each type of lesion. While 
assessing diagnostic significance of MUC13 using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Khan et al. Page 5

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptanalysis, MUC13 expression effectively differentiated PanINs (n=29) from healthy controls 
(HC; n=13) and chronic pancreatitis (CP; n=12) tissues ( AUC: 0.99; and 0.81, respectively ) 
(Fig 1D). The sensitivity (SN) and specificity (SP) differentiating PanINs from HC is SN: 
90%, SP: 100% and that from HC and CP is SN: 90%, SP: 59%.
Aberrant expression and subcellular localization of MUC13 in PDAC
To determine involvement of MUC13 in PDAC, we performed MUC13 expression profile 
analysis in different histological PanCa types and normal pancreas. MUC13 expression was 
observed in 94.6% ( p- value <0.0001 ) of PDAC samples (n=225, 95% positive, MCS=9.7; 
Fig. 2A and B) while, morphologically normal appearing tumor adjacent tissues (NAT) 
(n=100) showed faint to moderate staining in the ducts (n=100, 83% positive, MCS=4; Fig. 
2A and B). A low to moderate MUC13 expression (MCS of 4) is observed in NAT, which is 
significantly ( P-value<0.001 ) lower compared to PDAC (MCS of 9.7). Normal pancreatic 
ductal epithelia and acinar cells however, were largely negative for MUC13 expression 
(n=13, 7.6% positive, MCS=0.8; Fig. 2A and B). This data suggested some degree of 
molecular level alterations in NAT that are not morphologically apparent in these tissues. In 
contrast, faint or no staining was observed in adenosquamous carcinoma (n=18, 22% 
positive, MCS=1.2, P=0.001), neuroendocrine carcinoma (n=5, 20% positive, MCS=0.4, 
P=0.001), solid pseudo-papillary carcinoma and carcinoid tumors (n=6, 0% positive, 
MCS=0) (Fig. 2A and B). Completely normal ducts, acini or surrounding non-epithelial 
elements (lymphocytes or stroma) were typically not stained for MUC13 expression. 
Staining scores were recorded based on subcellular localization namely, membranous, 
cytoplasmic, nuclear and total staining and correlated with clinico-pathological parameters 
(Supplementary Table 2). Increased expression of MUC13 was observed only in PDAC 
samples sparing other PanCa types, suggesting its potential involvement in pancreatic ductal 
epithelial pathobiology.
Correlation of MUC13 expression with PDAC differentiation and stage
High MUC13 staining was observed in G2 (moderately differentiated) as compared to G1 
(well differentiated) and G3 (poorly differentiated) (Fig. 2A and supplementary Figure 2A; 
p<0.05) samples. These results suggest progressive expression of MUC13 during PDAC 
from well to moderately differentiated tumors and the expression pattern changed with 
overall lower condensed MUC13 expression in the poorly differentiated tumors.
PDAC samples were further grouped into two categories based on the clinical stage of the 
tumor, early (stage I and II) and late (stage III and IV). The majority of samples in both the 
stages were positive for MUC13 staining with only 4.9 % and 5.3 % negative samples in 
early and late stage cancers, respectively. Although, the MUC13 subcellular localization was 
predominantly observed at M+C+N (membrane+cytoplasm+nucleus) in case of both early 
and late stage cancers, the percentage of cases positive for M+C+N varied and was higher 
(89.4%) in late stage cancers in comparison to early stage (81.6%). Overall, the analysis of 
subcellular localization patterns of MUC13 with respect to the tumor stages indicated 
increased nuclear expression of MUC13 in case of stage II–IV disease when compared to 
Stage I (Fig. 2D and Supplementary Figure 2B; p<0.05 and Supplementary Table 2). 
Supplementary Figure 2C is the representative image showing marked nuclear expression in Khan et al. Page 6
HPB (Oxford) . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 June 01.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptstage IV . ROC curve analyses revealed that both overall (Fig. 2E) and nuclear (Fig. 2D) 
expression of MUC13 efficiently differentiated healthy controls (HC; n=13) from early stage 
(ESC; n= 182) and late stage cancers (LSC; n=19) ( AUC>0.9 ).
Association of MUC13 expression with clinico-pathological parameters
To establish association of MUC13 with clinico-pathological parameters, patient samples 
were grouped and analyzed for MUC13 positivity based on sex [130 males (96 % positive) 
and 74 females (100 % positive)], age [87 patients with age <60 (94.2 %) and 123 with age 
>60 (95.9 %)], and TNM staging  [124 individuals with tumor located to pancreas (95.9 % 
positive) and 85 with extension beyond pancreas (94.1 % positive); 136 individuals (94.1 %) 
with no lymph node involvement (94.1 % positive) and 59 individuals with lymph node 
metastasis (96.6 % positive)]. The incidence of MUC13 positivity significantly correlated 
with advanced stage growth into adjacent organs or metastasis to lymph nodes (N1-N2); 
overall (MCS N0=8.9 Vs N1-N2=10.1; p=0.1), membrane (MCS N0=8.1 Vs N1-N2=9.1; 
p=0.5), Cytoplasm (MCS N0=6.9 Vs N1-N2=8.2; p=0.1) and nucleus (MCS N0=2.0 Vs N1-
N2=3.9; p=0.01). Both the nuclear intensity and its percentage positivity in the tumor were 
higher in cases characterized to have increased nodal metastasis from 1– 4 lymph nodes 
(Fig. 3A, B, Supplementary Figure 4 and Table 3). MUC13 expression was lower in N0 
disease compared with N1 while increased MUC13 staining was found in the nucleus with 
PDAC extending beyond pancreas (T3-T4) (MCS T1-T2=2.1 Vs T3-T4=3.9; p=0.13). These 
studies indicate noticeable differences in subcellular localization of MUC13 and association 
of its aberrant subcellular localization with the clinical disease parameters. Since, nuclear 
expression of MUC13 was considerably higher in T3/T4 or N1 disease (Fig. 3B), it suggests 
the clinical significance of nuclear MUC13 expression in pancreatic tumor invasion and 
metastasis.
To validate MUC13 IHC results, we performed immunoblotting and RT-PCR experiments in 
a cohort of 14 matched fresh-frozen tumor (14 PDAC tumors; PT-I to PT-XIV) and adjacent 
tumor tissue samples (NAT; PN-I to PN-XIV). MUC13 expression was observed in all tumor 
samples (Fig. 3C and D, upper panels) whereas, faint (n=4) or no (n=10) expression was 
detected in NAT samples (Fig. 3C and D, lower panels). We also performed quantitative 
MUC13 expression analysis for its association with the tumor size (cm), which showed a 
positive correlation ( R2=0.36 ) between increased MUC13 expression and the tumor size 
(Fig. 4A). Additionally, we performed genetic algorithm analysis using feature selector 
“best-fit attribute selector” and “classifier Neural Network” (Fig 4Bi and ii) softwares to 
determine association of different MUC13 expression patterns with clinical features. 
Analysis of this dataset was reduced to just 5 strong features namely sex, tumor invasion, 
lymph node involvement, nuclear intensity and nuclear percentage to predict clinical 
outcome/patient survival. On further applying genetic algorithm along with the same 
classifier Neural Network 25, the prediction of survival was more clear and accurate (Fig. 
4Bi–ii and Supplementary Table 4). Our computational analysis suggests that the nuclear 
intensity of MUC13 (NUC INT) was the strongest attribute selected by “best-fit” and 
Genetic algorithm. However, percentage of area positive for MUC13 (NUC %) and its 
overall nuclear expression (NUC MCS) outperforms other attributes for patient survival. Our 
results show that Genetic algorithm along with Neural Network performed better compared Khan et al. Page 7
HPB (Oxford) . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 June 01.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptto best fit with same classifier to predict patient’s prognosis (Supplementary Figure 5A–C). 
We have also shown the gradual reduction in error for 10 iterations, wherein Prediction Error 
Value is reduced after selecting strong features in each iteration using Genetic Algorithm 
and Neural Network. Further, we observed that overall nuclear expression (NUC MCS); 
attribute 17 with feature count value (FCV) as 10, is the strongest attribute in the feature set 
that can best predict the patient survival (Supplementary Figure 5B and C). Each time a 
feature is used in an iteration, its nuclear FCV increases. So the attribute with highest FCV is 
considered to be the strongest one, which means even less staining in nucleus, can predict 
patient’s poor prognosis. Nuclear MUC13 expression correlated with overall poor patient’s 
survival, nodal status (No-N1), depth of tumor invasion (T3-T4), tumor stage, and tumor 
grade compared with other subcellular localization patterns (Fig. 4C and Inset-1). A unit 
increase in nuclear MUC13 MCS resulted in a 21% ( hazard ratio=1.20, 95% CI=1.08, 1.35, 
p=0.0005 ) increase in mortality. The tumors positive for high MUC13 expression or 
cytoplasm + nucleus also showed a trend toward shorter survival. These results suggest 
prognostic significance of nuclear expression of MUC13 in predicting the survival fate of 
PDAC patients in ROC curve (Fig. 4D; AUC>0.9 ).
MUC13 expression leads to increased degree of disorder in PDAC
We sought to determine if MUC13 expression has an association with submicron scale 
morphological alterations occurring in PDAC tissues, as described earlier 4, 26. Enhanced 
morphological disorder ( Lmd) in MUC13 positive tumors was observed compared to 
negative counterparts (p<0.001) (Fig. 5Ai). The order of morphological disorder was 
significantly higher (p<0.001) in nuclear positive areas, compared to being lowest in only 
membrane positive areas (Fig. 5Aii and iii).
Parallel results were corroborated in PDAC cell lines that endogenously express MUC13 
(HPAF-II and AsPC-1) or are MUC13 null cells (Panc-1 and BxPC-3) (p<0.001) (Fig. 5B). 
Additionally, cells endogenously expressing MUC13 (HPAF-II-sh-V), show conspicuous 
morphological distortion ( Lmd), while compared to MUC13 knockdown cells (HPAF-sh-
M13) as depicted by the average IPR values (p<0.001) (Fig. 5C). However, ectopic 
expression of MUC13 in Panc-1 cells (MUC13 null) significantly (p<0.001) increased the 
degree of morphological distortion ( Lmd) (Fig. 5D). This unique study suggest that MUC13 
expression is associated with the enhanced mass-density variation, which further explains its 
role in tumor metastasis and aggressiveness 22, 23.
DISCUSSION
The high mortality observed for PanCa is mainly attributable to the often advanced stage of 
disease at diagnosis, thus the development of early diagnostic modalities for this disease 
should be a top priority and these modalities should be specific and sensitive enough to 
detect occult disease and precursor lesions. Our previous studies have suggested that 
MUC13, a recently identified membrane tethered glycoprotein, is highly overexpressed in 
PanCa while nearly undetectable in normal pancreatic tissue 3–5. However, due to the lack of 
availability of highly specific reagents related to MUC13, its utility as a PanCa biomarker 
has not been explored in a comprehensive manner. Considering this fact, our group has Khan et al. Page 8
HPB (Oxford) . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 June 01.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptrecently generated an array of anti-MUC13 MAbs that recognize MUC13 with high 
specificity. In the present study, using these novel reagents, we have established a MUC13 
expression profile in different PanCa types. The results of this study demonstrate a potential 
role for MUC13 as a novel molecular biomarker for PanCa diagnosis/prognosis.
Our results demonstrate MUC13 positivity in PanIN lesions, with a progressive increase in 
expression from PanIN-I to PanIN-III suggesting its critical implications in PanCa 
progression. Undetectable MUC13 expression in normal pancreas; and significantly higher 
MUC13 expression in PDAC (as opposed to other PanCa subytypes), indicates that MUC13 
expression is unique to PDAC and may be a useful marker for early PDAC. The diagnostic 
potential of MUC13 was further elaborated through a ROC analysis which discriminately 
differentiated early pancreatic lesions with controls (HC or BC or CP). We also found an 
increased MUC13 expression from well to moderately differentiated PDAC, although the 
expression declined in poorly differentiated PDAC, which might be the result of acquired 
epigenetic alterations in cancer cells. These epigenetic alterations following repression of 
MUC13 in poorly differentiated tumors are possibly required for successful seeding of 
tumor cells at sites of metastases. These underlying complex processes are a prerequisite to 
the dynamic regulation of the detachment and re-attachment of tumor cells at the metastatic 
site 8. We believe this phenomenon, involves shedding of the bulky proteins from the tumor 
cell surface to interact with and attach to metastatic proteins that aid tumor cells 27.
Staining of MUC13 in PDAC was observed in the cell membrane, cytoplasm as well as in 
the nucleus. Of note, high nuclear expression of MUC13 correlated with poor patient 
survival in PDAC, indicating its prognostic significance. Computational analysis of PDAC 
also confirmed nuclear expression as the strongest predictor of patient survival. Additionally, 
morphological distortion in pancreatic cancer cells and tissues suggested increased degree of 
disorder and aggressiveness with aberrant MUC13 expression (from 
membranous<cytoplasmic<nuclear). These results unequivocally indicate the importance of 
MUC13 expression and provide strong implications of nuclear MUC13 expression in PanCa 
progression. Additionally, cellular and molecular mechanisms that trigger aberrant MUC13 
expression/localization is an interesting area for future research, as it can be helpful for 
developing new therapies to manage MUC13 driven PanCa progression and metastasis. 
Since MUC13 has a SEA domain (a cleavage site), therefore, it is also shed in the 
bloodstream and detected in sera of PanCa patients (Data not shown), efficiently 
discriminating PanCa patients with healthy individuals. Our hope is that this will lead to the 
development of a minimally invasive, cost-effective, and reproducible serum based detection 
system for PDAC. Moreover, our previous studies indicate a direct interaction of MUC13 
with HER2 in PanCa cell lines and tissues 4, it would be exciting to investigate the 
association of MUC13 expression with clinical outcome in HER2+ PDAC.
In conclusion, our recently developed method for using our newly generated MAb may 
prove extremely useful for MUC13 detection in PanCa. While MUC13 expression could be 
used for early diagnosis of PanCa, its aberrant expression/subcellular localization (nuclear) 
is of high prognostic significance. Utilizing radionucleotide labeled MUC13 antibody, our 
aim is to develop a discriminatory, non-invasive imaging tools for identifying dysplasia in 
early PDAC and its precursor lesions. We will also employ a unique technique to probe Khan et al. Page 9

PDAC. Additionally, we will formulate MUC13 targeted therapeutic strategies for PanCa 
patients. This will include designing of a novel nanoparticle technology for active tumor 
targeting via conjugation with MUC13 specific antibodies/aptamers for enhanced accrual of 
therapeutics at the tumor site. The largely, promising findings of this study are suggestive of 
future multi-center trials to assess the utility of MUC13 as a novel diagnostic/prognostic 
marker in pancreatic cancer.

This study provides an evaluation of MUC13 expression and its subcellular localization 
in human PDAC tissues and its association with the clinical course of the disease 
progression. Our study represents the most extensive expression profiling of MUC13 for 
PDAC to date and supports its clinical development for diagnostic and prognostic 
purposes. Our newly generated anti-MUC13 MAb can be useful for the development of 
novel diagnostic/prognostic test(s).Khan et al. Page 13
