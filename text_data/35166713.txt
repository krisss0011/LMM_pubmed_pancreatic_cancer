Introduction:The IMMray PanCan-d test combines an 8-plex biomarker signature with CA19-9 in a proprietary algorithm to detect pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in serum samples. This study aimed to validate the clinical performance of the IMMray PanCan-d test and to better understand test performance in Lewis-null (le/le) individuals who cannot express CA19-9.Methods:Serum samples from 586 individuals were analyzed with the IMMray PanCan-d biomarker signature and CA19-9 assay, including 167 PDAC samples, 203 individuals at high risk of familial/hereditary PDAC, and 216 healthy controls. Samples were collected at 11 sites in the United States and Europe. The study was performed by Immunovia, Inc (Marlborough, MA), and sample identity was blinded throughout the study. Test results were automatically generated using validated custom software with a locked algorithm and predefined decision value cutoffs for sample classification.Results:The IMMray PanCan-d test distinguished PDAC stages I and II (n = 56) vs high-risk individuals with 98% specificity and 85% sensitivity and distinguished PDAC stages I-IV vs high-risk individuals with 98% specificity and 87% sensitivity. We identified samples with a CA19-9 value of 2.5 U/mL or less as probable Lewis-null (le/le) individuals. Excluding these 55 samples from the analysis increased the IMMray PanCan-d test sensitivity to 92% for PDAC stages I-IV (n = 157) vs controls (n = 379) while maintaining specificity at 99%; test sensitivity for PDAC stages I and II increased from 85% to 89%.Discussion:These results demonstrate the IMMray PanCan-d blood test can detect PDAC with high specificity (99%) and sensitivity (92%).
