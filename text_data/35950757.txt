Objective:To establish an evidence-based cutoff and predictors for early recurrence in patients with resected locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC).Background:It is unclear how many and which patients develop early recurrence after LAPC resection. Surgery in these patients is probably of little benefit.Methods:We analyzed all consecutive patients undergoing resection of LAPC after induction chemotherapy who were included in prospective databases in The Netherlands (2015-2019) and the Johns Hopkins Hospital (2016-2018). The optimal definition for "early recurrence" was determined by the post-recurrence survival (PRS). Patients were compared for overall survival (OS). Predictors for early recurrence were evaluated using logistic regression analysis.Results:Overall, 168 patients were included. After a median follow-up of 28 months, recurrence was observed in 118 patients (70.2%). The optimal cutoff for recurrence-free survival to differentiate between early (n=52) and late recurrence (n=66) was 6 months ( P <0.001). OS was 8.4 months [95% confidence interval (CI): 7.3-9.6] in the early recurrence group (n=52) versus 31.1 months (95% CI: 25.7-36.4) in the late/no recurrence group (n=116) ( P <0.001). A preoperative predictor for early recurrence was postinduction therapy carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9≥100 U/mL [odds ratio (OR)=4.15, 95% CI: 1.75-9.84, P =0.001]. Postoperative predictors were poor tumor differentiation (OR=4.67, 95% CI: 1.83-11.90, P =0.001) and no adjuvant chemotherapy (OR=6.04, 95% CI: 2.43-16.55, P <0.001).Conclusions:Early recurrence was observed in one third of patients after LAPC resection and was associated with poor survival. Patients with post-induction therapy CA 19-9 ≥100 U/mL, poor tumor differentiation and no adjuvant therapy were especially at risk. This information is valuable for patient counseling before and after resection of LAPC.
