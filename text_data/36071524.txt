Background:Visceral hemangiomatosis is a benign tumor (rarer than hemangioma) that has not been reported to occur in the pancreas, duodenum, or choledoch. It can be easily confused with other pancreatic tumors or choledocholithiasis. Herein, we describe a case of a child with pancreaticoduodenal and choledochal hemangiomatosis and the key characteristics for the accurate diagnosis of pancreatic tumors based on previous reports and our findings.Case presentation:We report a case of a 2-year and 9-month-old child who presented with repeated and fluctuating jaundice for 3 months with a history of endoscopic stone removal in a local hospital, following the diagnosis of choledocholithiasis. An abdominal computed tomography revealed a previously undiagnosed pancreatic head tumor and celio-mesenteric trunk (a rare vascular variation). This was misdiagnosed as a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. Since the patient's parents refused FNA biopsy and insisted on surgery, pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed; however, postoperatively, the child was correctly diagnosed with pancreaticoduodenal and choledochal hemangiomatosis. Although the patient was in good condition and had gained 4 kg in weight 3 months postoperatively, pancreaticoduodenectomy could have been avoided if an accurate diagnosis had been established before or during the operation.Conclusion:Our report highlights the difficulty in diagnosing visceral hemangiomatosis. Radiologists, endoscopists, and surgeons should consider this possibility in cases of repeated and fluctuating jaundice that cannot be explained by choledocholithiasis alone.
