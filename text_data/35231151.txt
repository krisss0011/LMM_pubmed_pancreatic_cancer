Pancreatobiliary pathology encompasses all benign and malignant disease within the pancreas and biliary tract; pancreatic cancer is currently the seventh leading cause of death worldwide accounting for approximately 466,000 deaths per annum. Cytology has been increasingly used in the physician's toolbox to provide an accurate, non-invasive and cost-effective modality for the diagnosis of pancreatobiliary lesions. The cytological appearance alone may be insufficient to establish the diagnosis and it is crucial for effective clinicopathological correlation in a multidisciplinary setting, highlighting the vital role of the pathologist to ensure effective and quality care. The advent of modern diagnostic techniques has allowed for a less invasive approach to tissue sampling which when combined with routine staining and specialised immunohistochemistry can help guide the diagnosis. The Papanicolaou classification is comparable to the current C1-C5 system which will enable standardised reporting to help improve communication with clinical colleagues and subsequent patient management, and our article discusses the criteria used by cytopathologists to determine the grade of both pancreatic and biliary lesions.
