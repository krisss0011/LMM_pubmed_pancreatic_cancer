Abstract
Three-dimensional cultured organoids have become a powerful in vitro research tool that preserves genetic,
phenotypic and behavioral trait of in vivo organs, which can be established from both pluripotent stem cells and
adult stem cells. Organoids derived from adult stem cells can be established directly from diseased epithelium and
matched normal tissues, and organoids can also be genetically manipulated by CRISPR-Cas9 technology.
Applications of organoids in basic research involve the modeling of human development and diseases, including
genetic, infectious and malignant diseases. Importantly, accumulating evidence suggests that biobanks of patient-
derived organoids for many cancers and cystic fibrosis have great value for drug development and personalized
medicine. In addition, organoids hold promise for regenerative medicine. In the present review, we discuss the
applications of organoids in the basic and translational research.

Background
Two-dimensional (2D) cultured cell lines have been the
main in vitro research tool for the past decades. Cell
lines are relatively cheap, easy to handle and can be ap-
plied to multiple experimental techniques. However, the
establishment of a cell line is time-consuming and
involves extensive genetic and phenotypic adaption to
culture conditions. Thus, most cell lines are derived
from tumors or have acquired oncogenic potential
in vitro , while matching normal cells are usually lacking.
The main problem of cell lines is the homogeneity of
the cells, short of differentiated cell types in the original
tissue. These problems limit the use of cell lines in per-
sonalized medicine and make them less suited to tissue
physiology research requiring differentiated cell types. In
cancer research, the preclinical research model that canphenocopy tumor heterogeneity is highly needed for re-
search on the mechanisms of cancer progression and ac-
quired drug resistance. In 1953, the first patient-derived
xenograft (PDX) models were successfully established
(Toolan 1953 ). In this model, primary tumor tissue is
transplanted into immune-deficient mice, while tumor
structure and the relative proportion of tumor cells and
stromal cells are largely preserved (Byrne et al. 2017 ).
Thus, PDXs better retain the complexity and heterogen-
eity of the parental tumor than do cell lines, but estab-
lishment is still inefficient and early tumors are hard to
establish (John et al. 2011 ). Besides, genetic manipula-
tions cannot be carried out, and high-throughput ana-
lyses are expensive and hampered by complex logistics.
Last decade has witnessed a booming development of
three-dimensional (3D) cell culture technologies. The
advent of organoids avoids many of the disadvantages
associated with cell lines and PDX. An organoid is char-
acterized as a 3D structure, grown from stem and pro-
genitor cells and consisting of variant organ-specific cell
types, that self-organize via cell differentiation and
spatially restricted lineage commitment (Clevers 2016 ).

https://doi.org/10.1186/s13619-020-00059-zOrganoids can be grown from two types of cells: (i)
pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), such as embryonic stem
cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs),
or (ii) adult stem cells (ASCs) (Clevers 2016 ;Rookmaaker
et al. 2015 ). Organoids are proved amenable to all stand-
ard laboratory techniques, as well as to genetic modifica-
tion (Drost et al. 2017 ;Drost et al. 2015 ;Schwank et al.
2013 ). Organoids can be fast expanded, cryopreserved
and applied to high-throughput analyses. Though orga-
noid cultures cannot mimic interactions with vasculature
and stroma, organoids are a promising research model
bridging the gap between cell lines and PDXs (Fig. 1)
(Drost 2018 ; Sachs and Clevers 2014 ).
PSCs-derived organoids
Since cell lines of ESCs and iPSCs were established, re-
searchers began to apply insights to induce these stem
cells to generate differentiated cell types (Chen et al.
2014 ; Cherry 2012 ). Yoshiki Sasai and colleagues firstly
dug deeper by questioning whether such an in vitro
model could mimic in vivo development and thus devel-
oped methods to culture brain, retina and pituitary
structures ‘in a dish ’(Eiraku 2012 ; Eiraku et al. 2008 ).
Later, iPSCs-derived organoids from optic cup, intestine,
stomach, liver, lung, thyroid and kidney, were followed(Chen et al. 2017 ;Kurmann et al. 2015 ;McCracken et al.
2014 ;McCracken et al. 2011 ;Nakano et al. 2012 ;Takasato
et al. 2015 ;Takebe et al. 2013 ). Of note, each germ layer
(endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm) is represented
among this set of organs.
Typically, iPSCs are expanded and subsequently differ-
entiated through a multi-step protocol that moves to-
wards a fully differentiated structure, and specific
cocktails of growth factors are required for each step
(Fig. 2). The differentiation process usually takes about
2-3 months, which depends on the specific type of organ
(McCracken et al. 2011 ). The structure of iPSCs-derived
organoids is complex and may contain mesenchymal, as
well as epithelial and endothelial components. Because
differentiation protocols recapitulate development
in vitro , iPSCs-derived organoids are excellent models
for studying development (Takasato et al. 2015 ), genetic
diseases (Freedman et al. 2015 ), and infectious disease
(Garcez et al. 2016 ).
Another air-liquid interface (ALI) method was intro-
duced allowing for the preservation of both epithelium
and matched in vitro stromal microenvironment (Neal
et al. 2018 ). The ALI method employs a Boyden
chamber-like structure where primary tissue is seeded in
ECM (extracellular matrix) gel in an inner TranswellTM
Fig. 1 Comparison of cell lines, patient-derived xenografts and organoids. Cell lines have low cost, are easy to handle and can be applied to
multiple experimental techniques. PDXs preserve tumor heterogeneity and tumor-stromal interactions. PDOs can be derived from both epithelial
cancer cells and normal epithelium and cultured in an extracellular matrix (ECM) -providing basement membrane extractLiet al. Cell Regeneration            (2020) 9:21 Page 2 of 33dish which is exposed to air to enhance oxygenation
(DiMarco et al. 2014 ;Li et al. 2014 ;Ootani et al. 2009 ).
Culture medium is added to the outer dish and can dif-
fuse through the permeable TranswellTMinto the inner
dish (Fig. 3). ALI method has been applied in PSCs-
derived organoid culture lately. Koike and colleagues
(Koike et al. 2019 ) reported the continuous patterning
and dynamic morphogenesis of hepatic, biliary and pan-
creatic structures, invaginating from ALI culture of an-
terior and posterior gut spheroids differentiated from
human PSC. Adapted ALI culture of human cerebral
organoids (Giandomenico et al. 2019 ) and neocortical
organoid (Qian et al. 2020 ) derived from PSCs were also
developed.
ASCs-derived organoids
Complementary to PSCs-derived organoids that recap-
itulate development in vitro , ASCs-derived organoids
model adult tissue repair (Clevers 2016 ) and can be
established only from regenerative tissue compartments.
In 1987, researches began to explore 3D-culture byculturing primary cells on a reconstituted basement
membrane from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) tumor
(Li et al. 1987 ;Shannon et al. 1987 ). Li and colleagues
found mammary epithelial cells cultured on EHS matrix
could form ducts, ductules, and lumina and resemble
secretory alveoli. Shannon and colleagues cultured adult
rat type II cells on EHS matrix with feeder layer cells
(mainly fibroblasts) and revealed that cell-matrix interac-
tions help type II cells preserve their original cubical
shape and morphological characteristics of variable dif-
ferentiated cells. Exploration based on ASCs-derived 3D
culture has been led to a new stage.
Two decades later, ASCs-derived organoids were suc-
cessfully developed from Lgr5-positive intestinal stem
cells in culture conditions modeling the stem cell niche
of intestine (Sato et al. 2011 ;Sato et al. 2009 ). By provid-
ing the Wnt agonist R-spondin, epidermal growth factor
(EGF), and the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) in-
hibitor Noggin, and embedding the cells in an extracel-
lular matrix (ECM) -providing basement membrane
extract (WENR method, Wnt3a+EGF+Noggin+R-

each of the three germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm) under specific differentiation signals. PSCs-derived organoids can be applied
to studying development, genetic diseases, and infectious diseaseLiet al. Cell Regeneration            (2020) 9:21 Page 3 of 33spondin-1), Lgr5-positive stem cells are able to self-
organize, proliferate and form differentiated crypt-villus-
like organoids (Fig. 4a, b). Since then, by modifying
cocktails of growth factors and cell isolation procedures,
cultures of patient-derived organoids (PDOs) have been
successfully established for various human tissues by bi-
opsy or resection, including the esophagus (Sato et al.
2011 ), stomach (Bartfeld et al. 2015 ), colon (van de
Wetering et al. 2015 ), liver (Broutier et al. 2017 ;Hu et al.
2018 ;Huch et al. 2015 ), pancreas (Boj et al. 2015 ), saliv-
ary gland (Nanduri et al. 2014 ), fallopian tube (Kessler
et al. 2015 ), ovary (Hill et al. 2018 ;Kopper et al. 2019 ),
prostate (Gao et al. 2014 ;Karthaus et al. 2014 ), breast
(Sachs et al. 2018 ), airway (Sachs et al. 2019 ), taste buds
(Ren et al. 2014 ), endometrium (Turco et al. 2017 ), kid-
ney (Schutgens et al. 2019 ), bladder (Lee et al. 2018 ),
thyroid (Saito et al. 2018 ), biliary tract (Saito et al. 2019 ),
oral mucosa (Driehuis et al. 2019a ) and glioblastoma
(Jacob et al. 2020 ) (Fig. 5, Table 1).
A counterintuitive phenomenon is found that normal
epithelium organoids often outgrow tumor organoids,
which, in some instances, can be prevented by using
cancer-specific selection methods. For example, tumor
organoids from colorectal cancer (CRC) can be select-
ively expanded upon withdrawal of Wnt3a and R-
Spondin1. Nearly all CRCs harbor activating mutations
in the Wnt pathway or fusion of RSPO(R-spondin-1)
genes, allowing for the expansion of cancer cells without
Wnts and R-spondins, while normal epithelial cells ar-
rest (Nusse 2017 ;Sato et al. 2011 ;Seshagiri et al. 2012 ;van
de Wetering et al. 2015 ). Another approach to culture
tumor cells selectively is to stabilize wild-type P53 by
adding the MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3 (Drost et al. 2015 ).
Tumor cells are not affected by Nutlin-3 due to a loss ofTP53 (Olivier et al. 2010 ), while normal cells in culture
present cell cycle arrest and death, allowing for the se-
lection of tumor cells.
In general, PDOs using WENR method can be de-
rived from any epithelium of normal tissues as well
as malignant or otherwise diseased tissues within ap-
proximately 7 days after embedding the cells into
ECM matrix (Fig. 3c; Fig. 5). PDOs can be expanded
long term and cryopreserved while remaining genetic-
ally stable, making organoids an ideal tool for disease
modeling. In addition, this type of organoid culture
allows the direct parallel expansion of diseased cells
and matched normal cells from individual patients,
which allows for the generation of living tumor orga-
noid biobank and facilitates its potential application
in personalized therapy (Fig. 6). However, to date,
nearly all PDOs types represent only the epithelial
parts of organs, and there is an absence of stroma,
nerves, and vasculature.
Adopting ALI method, researchers can generate
ASCs-derived organoids from various murine tissues
including small intestine, colon, stomach, and pan-
creas (Li et al. 2014 ;Ootani et al. 2009 ), then extend-
ing to culture clinical tumor samples (Neal and Kuo
2016 ; Neal et al. 2018 ), accurately recapitulating stem
cell populations and their multi-lineage differentiation.
The ALI model preserves tumor microenvironment
with tumor parenchyma and stroma, including func-
tional tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), providing
a promising model for immunotherapy research for
patients with cancer (Neal et al. 2018 ).
In the remainder of this review, we will discuss how
PSCs-derived organoids and ASCs-derived organoids are
applied in basic and translational research.
Fig. 3 Comparison of different culture methods for adult stem cells-derived organoids. In the WENR method, epithelial organoids are derived
from tumor biopsies directly in Matrigel with cocktail growth factors, with long-term expansion but no tumor micro environment. In the air-liquid
interphase (ALI) method, tumor biopsies are cultured in ALI in the entire tumor microenvironment as a cell suspension of all cell types, including
immune cells and other non-epithelial cell types, but with limited expansionLiet al. Cell Regeneration            (2020) 9:21 Page 4 of 33Organoids for basic research
Tissue physiology
Organoids as a research tool for stem cell biology
Organoids is an ideal in vitro tool for the identification
of novel stem cell markers, and the study of physio-
logical phenomena requiring the coculture of multiple
cell types. Lgr5+ cells located at the crypt base was veri-
fied as the real intestinal stem cells (Barker et al. 2007 ).
Enlightened by the finding that Lgr5+intestinal stem
cells can undergo thousands of cell divisions in vivo ,
Sato and colleagues (Sato et al. 2011 ;Sato et al. 2009 )successfully established the epithelial organoids from a
single Lgr5+ stem cell, which are also known as “mini-
guts ”. Wnt signals, Notch signals, EGF signals and BMP
signals together contribute the stem cell niche homeo-
stasis (Clevers 2013 ). Other stem cell biomarkers have
been explored to initiate intestinal organoid cultures, in-
cluding CD24 (von Furstenberg et al. 2011 ), EphB2 (Jung
et al. 2011 ), and CD166+/GRP78 (Wang et al. 2013 ).
Mini-guts contain multiple differentiated cell types. Rap-
idly dividing, transit-amplifying (TA) daughter cells de-
rived from Lgr5+cells can differentiate to enterocytes,

and the M cells that cover Peyer ’s patches (Clevers
2013 ),contributing to the study of physiology of crypt-
villus axis. Lendeboom and colleagues (Lindeboom et al.
2018 ) applied a multi-omics framework on stem cell-
enriched and enterocytes-enriched mouse intestinal
organoids to reveal multiple layers of gene expression
regulation contributing to lineage specification and plas-
ticity of intestine and found that Hnf4g as a major driver
of enterocyte differentiation. As another example, Beu-
mer and colleagues (Basak et al. 2017 ;Beumer et al.
2018 ) used organoids to study the effect of growth fac-
tors on hormone expression in enteroendocrine cells
after establishing a protocol to obtain enteroendocrine
cells in organoids. In organoids, hormones in enteroen-
docrine cells were differentially expressed based on the
presence or absence of BMP4. This finding was then
studied in a mouse model, and it was found that the
BMP gradient along the crypt-villus axis in vivo dictates
a switch in expressed hormones in enteroendocrine cells
that migrate up this BMP gradient. Beumer and his col-
leagues (Beumer et al. 2020 ) further constructed an
organoid-based platform for functional studies of human
enteroendocrine cells, which can be induced by transient
expression of NEUROG3 . By using single-cell mRNA se-
quencing and mass-spectrometry, they revealed differ-
ences of human enteroendocrine cells with mice, andseveral secreted products were identified and validated
by functional experiments.
The mini-gut culture approach has been applied to the
generation of organoids derived from the epithelial com-
partments of a variety of murine and human tissues of
ecto-, meso- and endodermal origin, and promotes the
study of stem cell biology of other tissues except for in-
testine. For example, long-term expanding organoids
modeling mature pyloric epithelium can be efficiently
generated from single Lgr5+stem cells located at the
base of pyloric glands (Barker et al. 2010 ). Later, Strange
and colleagues (Stange et al. 2013 ) discovered that Troy+
chief cells can spontaneously dedifferentiate to act as
multipotent epithelial stem cells in vivo , particularly
upon damage. Importantly, single Troy+chief cells can
initiate long-term expanding gastric organoids, contain-
ing various cell types of corpus glands. The finding fur-
ther confirms Troy+chief cells ’role as “reserve ”stem
cells upon challenge of tissue homeostasis.
Organoids for generation of specific cell types
Organoid culture allows for the generation of specific
cell types that were previously impossible in 2D cultures.
For example, hepatocytes can be successfully established
and expanded in organoid culture (Hu et al. 2018 ;Peng
et al. 2018 ). Based on adult bile duct-derived bipotent
progenitor organoids (Huch et al. 2015 ), culture

human hepatocyte organoids. The organoids proliferate
greatly after transplanting into mice (Hu et al. 2018 ).
The resulting hepatocytes maintained its original physio-
logical functions, including secreting cytoplasmic glyco-
gen particles, forming bile canaliculi, and expressing
albumin and cytochrome P450 enzymes. Based on orga-
noid culture system of hepatocytes, Peng and colleagues
(Peng et al. 2018 ) described a unique effect of tumor ne-
crosis factor- α, a cytokine essential for liver regeneration
and found that the addition of regeneration-enhancing
cytokines in facilitating the in vitro expansion of cell
types that are otherwise difficult to culture. As another
example, Yin and colleagues (Yin et al. 2014 )showed
modulation of Wnt and Notch signaling in intestinal
organoids to direct lineage differentiation into mature
enterocytes, goblet cells and Paneth cells. Specifically,
the combination of IWP-2 (Inhibitor of Wnt Production
2; Wnt pathway inhibitor) and VPA (valproic acid;
Notch activator) specifically induced enterocyte differen-
tiation, presumably by combining the effects of both in-
hibitors, in which IWP-2 induced enterocytedifferentiation while VPA suppressed the differentiation
of Lgr5+ stem cells toward secretory cell types. The
combination of DAPT (Notch inhibitor) and CHIR
(chicken immunoglobulin-like receptor; GSK3 βinhibi-
tor) mainly induced Paneth cell differentiation, and the
combination of IWP-2 and DAPT primarily induced
goblet cell differentiation. These methods provide new
tools for the study and application of multiple intestinal
epithelial cell types.
Organoids as a genetically stable in vitro research tool
Organoids can be established from a single cell, which
makes it possible to study the mutational status of single
stem cells. The gradual accumulation of genetic muta-
tions in stem cells throughout life is related to a variety
of age-related diseases, including cancer. In this way,
Blokzijl and colleagues (Blokzijl et al. 2016 ) were able to
unveil mutation rates and patterns in normal stem cells
throughout life by whole-genome sequencing (WGS)
analysis (with peripheral blood as a reference for germ-
line mutations). Interestingly, the mutation rate, with
around 40 novel mutations per year per stem cell, was
Fig. 6 Applications of adult stem cells-derived organoids. aOrganoids derived from normal tissue are useful for studying physiology. For disease
modeling, organoids can be genetically engineered to model genetic and malignant diseases by using CRISPR-Cas9. Normal organoids can also
be infected with different types of pathogens to model infectious disease. Normal organoids can be transplanted to wounds for tissue repair. b
Tumor-derived organoids can be used for basic research by genetic modification and modeling rare cancer. For translational research, tumor-
derived organoids can be used for biobanking, genetic repair and drug screening studies, both for personalized medicine (to choose the most
effective treatment for a specific patient) and drug development (to test a compound library on a specific set of tumor organoids), as well as
immunotherapy researchLiet al. Cell Regeneration            (2020) 9:21 Page 8 of 33similar in liver, small intestine, and colon stem cells, re-
gardless of the large variation in cancer incidence of
these organs. However, the types of mutations detected
and the resulting mutational signatures in colon and
small intestine cells were different from those in liver
cells. To be pointed out, the inter-individual variation in
mutation rate and spectra are low, indicating organ-
specific activity of common mutational processes
throughout life.
Disease modeling
CRISPR-Cas9 technology as a useful tool for disease
modeling of organoids
The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
repeats (CRISPR) associated protein 9 (Cas9)/CRISPR
system has become a major technology for mammalian
genome editing. The system consists of Cas9 nuclease
derived from Streptococcus pyogenes and guide RNA
which can recognize and target a specified DNA se-
quence preceding the motif sequence adjacent to the.
CRISPR-Cas9 can generate DNA double-strand breaks
at specific genomic sites. Mammalian double-strand
DNA breaks can be repaired by two ways, non-
homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homology-directed
repair (HDR). NHEJ inserts indels randomly in the
process of repair, and biallelic introduction of indels
leads to gene knock-out (Komor and Badran 2017 ). On
the other hand, HDR can replace the damaged allele by
existing intact genome, thus when tailored DNA tem-
plates are co-delivered with CRISPR-Cas9, HDR can be
used for gene knock-in (Komor and Badran 2017 ).
Although the CRISPR-Cas9 technology has broadened
its applications to a series of purposes, including DNA
base editing, RNA targeting, epigenome editing and gene
expression manipulation (Adli 2018 ;Komor and Badran
2017 ), the use of CRISPR-Cas9 on organoids still basic-
ally harness NHEJ and HDR to engineer genes of inter-
est. Indeed, organoids are ideal model for investigating
gene function by genome editing, as the organoid system
allows for fast expansion with stable genetics and pheno-
type. Previous studies have successfully achieved genome
editing by installing CRISPR-Cas9 into organoids using
various approaches, including liposomal transfection,
electroporation and viral infection (Fig. 7). However,
variable experimental conditions limit the efficiency of
genome editing in organoids, including the recovery
after single-cell isolation, approaches for CRISPR-Cas9
delivery, and the cleavage efficiency of the guide RNA.
Selection and enrichment of positive organoids are ne-
cessary after CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing, or
otherwise, labor-intensive organoid cloning, followed by
sequencing of expanded organoid clones is needed. Re-
cently, Ringel and his colleagues (Ringel et al. 2020 ) de-
veloped a genome-wide pooled-library CRISPR screenapproach by capturing sgRNA (single-guide RNA) inte-
grations in single human intestinal organoids to dissect
oncogenic signaling pathways. Their screening method
would be broadly applicable to various organoid models
and selection assays, which may contribute to dissecting
human disease mechanisms and facilitating biological
discovery in primary 3D tissue models.
Genetic disease
Currently, organoids have become a useful tool to model
genetic diseases. Generally, two types of methods have
been adopted: (i) organoids established from patient-
derived biopsies; (ii) specific genetic mutations intro-
duced to wild-type organoids using CRISPR-Cas9
technology.
Cystic fibrosis
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the best example for PDO model-
ing human genetic disease. CF is a monogenic chan-
nelopathy caused by inactivating mutations in the CF
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.
The disease involves multiple organs, including the in-
testine, lung, pancreas, liver, kidney and sweat gland. In
gastrointestinal organs and lungs, decreased CFTR func-
tion results in reduced chloride transport through CFTR
toward the extracellular space, leading to a reduced
water flow by osmosis and, hence, increased density of
mucus. In the sweat glands, loss of CFTR function leads
to a high saline concentration in sweat.
Organoid model was firstly derived from rectum of CF
patients. Early work with organoids derived from the
rectum of CF patients revealed CFTR function: wild-type
organoids rapidly swell upon opening the CFTR channel
in a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-
dependent manner through the addition of forskolin
(FSK) (Dekkers et al. 2013 ). Rectal organoids from CF
patients do not respond to FSK, but it is restored upon
pre-incubation with CFTR-restoring compounds (Dek-
kers et al. 2013 ) or upon correction of the CFTR muta-
tion by CRISPR-Cas9 (Schwank et al. 2013 ). Based on
this finding, this organoid-based FSK-induced swelling
assay began to be used to test drug response on orga-
noids isolated from patients harboring different CFTR
mutations, including rare variants (Dekkers et al. 2013 ).
Lung is another organ that can be severely harmed by
CF. Due to CFTR mutation, a thick sticky mucus forms
in the lungs, which impairs breathing and provides a fer-
tile environment for pathogens reproduction, leading to
premature respiratory failure. CF airway organoids can
be established from patient-derived iPSCs (Firth et al.
2015 ), bronchial epithelial cells based on both ALI (Ful-
cher et al. 2005 ) and WENR cultures (Sachs et al. 2019 )
or bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (no biopsy needed)
(Sachs et al. 2019 ;Sondo et al. 2014 ). Airway organoidsLiet al. Cell Regeneration            (2020) 9:21 Page 9 of 33from CF patients had an increased mucus layer, recap-
itulating the disease phenotype. FSK-induced swelling in
airway organoids was reduced compared with organoids
from normal controls and could be restored with CFTR-
restoring compounds. However, in contrast to rectal
organoids, FSK-induced swelling in lung organoids did
not depend on CFTR alone, it was also influenced by the
chloride transporter TMEM16A, which is set as an alter-
native therapeutic target for CF patients. Therefore, air-
way organoids may function as an additional platform
for assessing drug response to CF, particularly for drugs
acting on TMEM16A.
Besides, liver, pancreatic and kidney organoids derived
from CF patients can also be established. Sampaziotis
and colleagues (Sampaziotis et al. 2015 ) generated iPSCs
from skin fibroblasts of a CF patient with homozygous
F508 mutation and differentiated them into
cholangiocyte-like cells (CLC). CF-CLCs expressed dis-
played defective expression of CFTR protein. CF-CLCorganoids treated with experimental CF drug VX809 in-
creases CFTR function and improves intraluminal fluid
secretion. CF pancreatic organoids can be established
from PSCs of CF patients, including both human ESCs
and an iPSC line, to generate differentiated pancreatic
ductal epithelial cells (PDECs) (Simsek et al. 2016 ).
PDECs derived from CF-iPSCs showed decreased ex-
pression of CFTR protein and damaged chloride ion
channel activity, reappearing functional defects of pa-
tients with CF at the cellular level. In addition, a tubu-
loid line from urine of a CF patient was established
(Schutgens et al. 2019 ). At the morphological level, the
kidney tubuloids maintained folded over long-term cul-
ture, instead of the typical cystic phenotype, which was
probably due to the lack of CFTR function caused by
CFTR mutations F508del/S1251N. In tubuloids derived
from urine of CF patients, FSK caused slight swelling in
a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting residual
CFTR function, while after pre-incubation with the

swelling increased significantly. All the above CF orga-
noid models of different related organs allow in vitro as-
sessment of treatment response and development of
novel drugs. For a discussion of the use of CF-PDO for
personalized medicine, see Section 3.1.
Intestinal genetic diseases
Additionally, intestinal organoids harboring inactivation
mutation of TTC7A have been successfully derived from
patients with intestinal atresia, which recapitulates how
TTCA7 deficiency results in the loss of apical-basal cell
polarity in the intestinal epithelium that can be rescued
by adding Rho kinase inhibitors (Bigorgne et al. 2014 ).
Besides, intestinal organoids were derived from patients
with microvillus inclusion disease (MVIX) caused by
homozygous truncating mutations of syntaxin-3 (STX3)
gene. The model revealed that partial loss of brush
border microvilli and subapical accumulation of vesicles
are typical histological phenomena of the disease (Wie-
gerinck et al. 2014 ).
Liver genetic disease
Liver organoids have been generated from patients with
α1-antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency. Accumulation of mu-
tant A1AT in the endoplasmic reticulum in the liver
leads to fibrosis or cirrhosis. Liver organoids derived
from the patients indeed contained A1AT aggregates
and presented increased apoptosis, which might contrib-
ute to fibrosis and cirrhosis (Huch et al. 2015 ). Alagille
syndrome is caused by loss-of-function mutations in
JAG1 orNOTCH2 and leads to partial or complete bil-
iary atresia. Accordingly, organoids generated from a pa-
tient with Alagille syndrome can not differentiate toward
the biliary fate, whereas in proliferate conditions, no dif-
ferences were observed compared with healthy controls
(Andersson et al. 2018 ;Sachs et al. 2018 ).
Other genetic diseases model based on iPSCs-derived
organoids
iPSCs-derived organoids can also be manipulated by
CRISPR-Cas9 technology to model diseases in different
tissues. In human iPSCs-derived kidney organoids,
knock-out of podocalyxin (Kim et al. 2017 ) and PKD
genes (Cruz et al. 2017 ;Freedman et al. 2015 ) recapitu-
lated defects that mimic nephrotic syndrome and poly-
cystic kidney disease respectively, as well as contributed
to understanding the functions of the genes in the
pathogenesis context. Engineered iPSCs-derived liver
organoids helped in illustrating the various functions
that different mutations of JAG1 gene can have in the
development of bile ducts and genesis the Alagille syn-
drome: the C829X mutation of JAG1 can causessignificant alterations, while the G274D mutation does
not affect organoid properties (Guan et al. 2017 ).
In brain tissue, patient-specific iPSCs-derived brain
organoids can be used to model lissencephaly (Bersh-
teyn et al. 2017 ), Down syndrome (Xu et al. 2019 ),
and neuronal heterotopia(Klaus et al. 2019 ). Engi-
neered iPSCs-derived brain organoids were established
to model microcephaly by RNA interference of repro-
gramming factors (Lancaster et al. 2013 ), autism by
overexpression of the transcription factor FOXG1
( f o r k h e a db o xG 1 )( M a r i a n ie ta l . 2015 ), macrocephaly
by deletion of PTEN (Li et al. 2017 ), Timothy syn-
drome by introducing mutations in the CaV1.2 cal-
cium channel-interneurons (Birey et al. 2017 )a n d
Aicardi-Goutières syndrome by introducing inactiva-
tion mutation of TREX-1 (Thomas et al. 2017 ).
Fused organoids culture was recently established to
understand more complex biology, which was more ap-
plied in brain study. Bagley and colleagues (Bagley et al.
2017 ) firstly showed a co-culture method combining
brain regions of choice within one organoid tissue and
they generate a dorsal-ventral axis by fusing organoids
of dorsal and ventral forebrain identities. Combined with
reprogramming technology, their novel fusions of orga-
noids culture should offer researchers the possibility to
analyze complex neurodevelopmental defects using cells
from neurological disease patients and to test potential
therapeutic compounds. Xiang and his colleagues (Xiang
et al. 2017 ) successfully established and fused medial
ganglionic eminence (MGE) and cortex-specific orga-
noids from human pluripotent stem cells followed by
live imaging, to investigate MGE development and hu-
man interneuron migration and integration, which offers
deeper insight into molecular dynamics during human
brain development . The same research team developed
a new 3D system to create the reciprocal projections be-
tween thalamus and cortex by fusing the two distinct
region-specific organoids, providing a platform for un-
derstanding human thalamic development and modeling
circuit organizations and related disorders in the brain
(Xiang et al. 2019 ) .Generally, engineered organoids can
faithfully recapitulate genetic diseases and thus provide a
valid resource for basic research and for development of
novel therapeutics.
Infectious disease
Organoids are closed 3D structures that exhibit the ap-
ical side of the epithelium towards the lumen and the
basal membrane towards the outside. The apical mem-
brane within the lumen is initially exposed to pathogens
in vivo . Three different methods have been established
to reproduce the interaction between microbes and the
host in the organoids culture (Fig. 8).Liet al. Cell Regeneration            (2020) 9:21 Page 11 of 33In the first method, organoids are mechanically
sheared or digested into single-cell suspensions or large
particles and then they are incubated with pathogens,
which leads to infection of the cells. After embedded in
the 3D matrix, infected cells can reform organoids that
can be used to model infectious disease (Dang et al.
2016 ;Forbester et al. 2015 ;Nigro et al. 2014 ;Zhang et al.
2014 ). This method is easy to handle and do not require
special equipment. But, the efficiency of infection varies
among different pathogens and it can not reflect the ini-
tial interaction between microbes and the host. Besides,
during the process not only the apical side but also the
basal side of cells are exposed, thus nonspecific re-
sponses may be introduced due to the interaction of
pathogens with the basal side of the cells.
In the second method, pathogens are directly injected
in to the lumen of the organoids by a microinjection,
thus the initial interaction of pathogens and the early re-
sponse of the host cells can be captured and either apical
or basal interaction can be investigated separately (Bart-
feld et al. 2015 ;Leslie et al. 2015 ;McCracken et al. 2014 ).
This method is now the mainstream method to build in-
fection model. However, this method needs special such
as a microinjector and it is hard to perform quantita-
tively due to the different sizes of organoids.In the third method, when single cells digested from
organoids are seeded onto a 3D matrix-coated dish, they
grow as 2D monolayer with the apical side exposed.
Adding pathogens directly into the culture media allows
interaction between microbes and the host cells
(Ettayebi et al. 2016 ). The 2D culture contains various
differentiated cells and allows quantitative experiments,
while it does not resemble the in vivo 3D structure of
host tissues.
Based on the above approaches, organoids have been
adopted to model viral, bacterial, and parasitic infectious
diseases of different tissues, including diseases caused by
pathogens that previously could not be studied in vitro
(Table 2). These models recapitulate features of in vivo
infection and could help identify therapeutic targets and
develop novel drugs and vaccine.
Viral disease
PSCs-derived organoids were firstly used to model viral
disease. In neuroscience, the development of PSCs-
derived brain organoids help deciphered the sequence of
disease progression in Zika virus (Garcez et al. 2016 ;Qian
et al. 2016 ).Zika virus (ZIKV) mainly spreads by the Ae-
des aegypti mosquito and its infection can lead to micro-
cephaly, which was set as a public health emergency by
Fig. 8 Approaches of studying infectious diseases using organoids. Organoids can be micro-injected with the microbe, thus the microbe is in
direct contact with the apical side of epithelial cells, which became the mainstream method to build infection model. Organoids can also be
sheared into smaller aggregates, incubated with pathogens and re-seed into Matrigel. Alternatively, 3D organoids can be digested by enzyme
into single cells and grown as 2D monolayer cultures, and then microbes are added into the culture mediaLiet al. Cell Regeneration            (2020) 9:21 Page 12 of 33World Health Organization (WHO) in 2016. However,
the pathogenesis of the ZIKV infection was not fully
understood until brain organoids emerged. Multiple re-
search demonstrated that ZIKV infection can cause dis-
order of the cortical layers of cerebral organoid,
abrogating growth and thus halting neurogenesis.
Researchers found that ZIKV infection leads to the acti-
vation of the Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), contributing to
deregulated neurogenesis and decreased functional neu-
rons (Cugola et al. 2016 ). Gabriel and colleagues (Garcez
et al. 2016 ) further illustrated that two new isolated
ZIKVs have different patterns of pathogenicity. Unlike
the highly passed MR766 strain of ZIKV, the new
strains, infected apical proliferating progenitors, interfer-
ing with centrosomal protein assembly, which in turn
led to their premature differentiation and apoptosis,
resulting in microcephaly (Wells et al. 2016 ). The orga-
noids model of ZIKV infection also promotes the devel-
opment of treatment. In a high-throughput drug screen
of 6000 compounds, caspase-3 activity inhibitors,
Emricasan and Niclosamide, were found to be effective
in limiting ZIKV induced death of neural cortical pro-
genitor and ZIKV replication (Xu et al. 2016 ). Except for
ZIKV, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection, lead-
ing to Japanese encephalitis (JE), was modeled in gener-
ated telencephalon organoid (Zhang et al. 2018 ).
Researchers found that JEV infection caused decline of
cell proliferation and increase of cell death, and infectedastrocytes and neural progenitors. In addition, they re-
vealed variable antiviral immunity in brain organoids of
different stages of culture, which also provide clues to
develop effective therapeutics of such diseases.
Another example of PSCs-derived organoids applica-
tion in human disease is with hepatitis B virus (HBV). In
recent decades, treatments against HBV infection have
improved; however, the development of personalized
treatments has been hindered by the absence of person-
alized infection models. Nie and colleagues (Nie et al.
2018 ) generated PSCs-derived liver organoids that reca-
pitulated the genetic background of the donor, and
found HBV infection in PSCs-derived liver organoids
could reproduce the life cycle of HBV and HBV-induced
hepatic dysfunction, indicating that PSCs-derived liver
organoids may provide a promising personalized
infection model for the development of personalized
treatment for hepatitis.
In recent years, ASCs-derived organoids have become
the main force in infectious diseases modeling. ASCs-
derived organoids can be adopted to model the viral
infection of intestinal organoids. Gastric diarrhea in
humans is mostly caused by Human Norovirus (HuNoV)
and Rotavirus infection (Zheng et al. 2006 ). Although
both of these viruses are rampant, no proper vaccine has
been developed owing to the lack of in vitro culture
method supporting their replication. Intestinal organoids
that were cultured as monolayers allowed for extensiveTable 2 Organoids of different organs being used for studying infectious diseases

strains, the addition of bile to the culture medium was
required for replication (Ramani and Atmar 2014 ), indi-
cating that not only are in vivo-like host cells required
for productive infection but also an in vivo-like environ-
ment is relevant as well. Ettayebi and colleagues
(Ettayebi et al. 2016 ) reproduced HuNoV infection in an
organoid-virus co-culture system, with only a specific
GII.3 HuNov strain requiring the presence of bile.
Furthermore, lack of histo-blood group antigen (HBGA)
expression in intestinal organoids limits HuNov replica-
tion, suggesting that this culture system allows the
evaluation of potential treatments and preventions.
Similarly, researchers have shown that Rotavirus strain
(simian SA11) from clinical samples can proliferate in
PSCs-derived intestinal organoids (Finkbeiner et al.
2012 ;Yin et al. 2015 ).
In urinary system, BK virus , which is a tubule-specific
circular DNA virus, infects 1-10% of transplanted kid-
neys, leading in 10-80% of these infected kidneys to the
loss of the donor organ and no curative treatment exists
(Hirsch et al. 2005 ). Infection of kidney tubuloids (kid-
ney-derived organoids in which only the tubular epithe-
lium of the kidney is represented and glomeruli are
lacking) with BK virus yielded a patchy infection with
enlarged nuclei (due to intranuclear basophilic viral in-
clusions), similar to what is observed in kidney biopsies
from patients with BK virus nephropathy (Bohl and
Brennan 2007 ;Schutgens et al. 2019 ).
Respiratory infections pose a major global disease bur-
dens (Ferkol 2014 ).Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
alone causes hundreds of thousands deaths annually
among children, mostly in developing countries (Nair
et al. 2010 ). iPSCs-derived organoids of human airway
epithelium can be infected by RSV virus, which can re-
produce the morphological features of RSV infection in
the distal lung (Chen et al. 2017 ). Persson and colleagues
(Persson et al. 2014 ) established a ALI culture system for
infection of human airway epithelium with RSV virus
and they found that RSV has the potential to influence
the cellular composition of the airway epithelium. Be-
sides, ASCs-derived airway organoids using WENR
methods can also be infected with RSV, recapitulating
syncytia formation, cytoskeletal changes, and shedding
of epithelial cells (Mueller et al. 2005 ). RSV-infected
organoids attracted neutrophils more than did mock-
infected control organoids, making this the first orga-
noid model suitable for studying neutrophil-epithelium
interactions (Sachs et al. 2019 ). Intriguingly, RSV infec-
tion strongly increased organoid motility and ultimately
resulted in organoid fusion. Influenza viruses also pose a
major public health problem worldwide, and novel
emerging viruses may be lethal, as evidenced by the
poultry-derived H7N9 virus infection that has had a 39%mortality rate since 2013. The infection of differentiated
airway organoids with distinct strains of influenza virus
can discriminate between poorly infective and highly in-
fective strains (Zhou et al. 2018 ). Importantly, Hui and
colleagues (Hui et al. 2018 ) compared human and avian
strains of influenza A virus inin vitro human bronchus
and airway organoids, and found that the infection of
airway organoids yielded similar results regarding virus
replication and cytokine response. In addition, infection
of airway organoids with enterovirus 71 (EV71) showed
that EV71 replication kinetics are strain-dependent and
the model help identify new infectivity makers for EV71
(van der Sanden et al. 2018 ).
The year of 2020 witnessed the outbreak of corona-
virus disease-19 (COVID-19) caused by the virus severe
acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-
2) which presents influenza-like symptoms ranging from
mild disease to severe lung injury and multi-organ
failure, eventually leading to death, especially in older
patients with other co-morbidities. The WHO has de-
clared that COVID-19 is a public health emergency of
pandemic proportions. Organoids have been used as a
great platform to research how COVID-19 affects hu-
man and causes damage and for identifying possible
drug targets for COVID-19. Lamers and colleagues
(Lamers and Beumer 2020 ) infected enterocytes in hu-
man small intestinal organoids with SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 and found that the intestinal epithelium
supports SARS-CoV-2 replication, and organoids can be
served as an experimental model for coronavirus infec-
tion and biology. Zhou and colleagues (Zhou et al. 2020 )
established the first expandable organoid culture system
of bat intestinal epithelium which were fully susceptible
to SARS-CoV-2 infection and sustained robust viral rep-
lication. They also found active replication of SARS-
CoV-2 in human intestinal organoids indicating that the
human intestinal tract might be a transmission route of
SARS-CoV-2. In addition, Monteil and colleagues
(Monteil et al. 2020 ) found that SARS-CoV-2 can dir-
ectly infect engineered human blood vessel organoids
and human kidney organoids, which can be inhibited by
human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2), demon-
strating that hrsACE2 can be a possible drug for early
stages of COVID-19.
Bacterial disease
Salmonella typhi (S. typhi) and Clostridium difficile (C.
difficile) are the two major bacterial intestinal pathogens
that can cause diarrhea and gastrointestinal failures in
humans. These pathogens infection has been successfully
modeled using PSCs-derived intestinal organoids. Forbe-
ster and colleagues (Forbester et al. 2015 ) microinjected
liveS. typhi into the lumen of the iPSCs-derived intes-
tinal organoids and revealed that upon injection, NF- κBLiet al. Cell Regeneration            (2020) 9:21 Page 14 of 33signaling was activated and inflammatory factors were
secreted, which was consistent with previous findings in
animal models. Likewise, the Spence lab (Leslie et al.
2015 ) microinjected C. difficile toxin A (TcdA) and
Toxin B (TcdB) into the lumen of iPSCs-derived intes-
tinal organoids to model anaerobe C. difficile infection
(CDI). The injection of TcdA recapitulates the impair of
the epithelial barrier function and structure observed in
organoids colonized with viable C. difficile . In another
study, the Worrell lab (Engevik et al. 2015 ) observed a
decreased expression of NHE3 (Sodium/Hydrogen
Exchanger 3) and MUC2 (Mucoprotein2) protein in C.
difficile infected organoids compared to normal orga-
noids, which may help creating a favorable environment
for its colonization.
Bacterium Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is a
major risk factor for peptic ulcers, gastric adenocarcin-
oma and gastritis (Salama and Hartung 2013 ). Both gas-
tric organoids derived from iPSCs and ASCs can be used
to model H. pylori infection, by microinjecting H. pylori
strain into the lumen of organoids (McCracken et al.
2014 ), which can ensure the apical side exposed to H.
pylori. Luminal injection of H. pylori induces a potent
NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response (Bartfeld et al.
2015 ), connecting excessive microbial colonization of H.
pylori with the occurrence of gastric cancer. In a follow-
up study, researchers adopted gastric organoids to find
out how H. pylori finds its gastric niche: a potent
chemoattractant, urea, which produced by gastric epithe-
lium is essential for the colonization of H. pylori in the
gastric mucosa (Huang et al. 2015a ).
Chronic Salmonella infection of the gall bladder is as-
sociated with gallbladder carcinoma (Shukla et al. 2000 ).
Scanu and colleagues (Scanu et al. 2015 ) showed that
after Salmonella infection, mouse gallbladder organoids
exhibited characteristics of loss of polarity, familiar with
those showed in the mouse model of gallbladder cancer.
Another study found that gallbladder organoids pre-
exposed to Salmonella that lack functional TP53 showed
neoplastic transformations by activating AKT (protein
kinase B) and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)
pathway and could grow in culture media free of growth
factors (Scanu et al. 2015 ).
Parasitic disease
The protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium causes life-
threatening diarrhea in immunocompromised individ-
uals (e.g. people living with HIV and malnourished chil-
dren), and infection may spread to the lungs (Checkley
et al. 2015 ). Drug development requires detailed patho-
physiology information of Cryptosporidium , but the lack
of an optimal in vitro culture system hinders the experi-
mental approaches. Heo and colleague (Heo et al. 2018 )
infected epithelial organoids derived from human smallintestine and lung with Cryptosporidium and found that
the parasite can reproduce within the organoids and
complete its complex asexual and sexual life cycles for
multiple rounds.
Plasmodium parasites can cause malaria, which poses
a significant global health burden, with over 200 million
cases every year. Plasmodium parasites are maintained
between Anopheles mosquitoes and mammalian hosts in
a complex life cycle, and models to study them are chal-
lenging to establish, particularly for Plasmodium species
that infect humans (Mellin and Boddey 2020 ). Recently,
several studies reported the application of iPSCs-derived
hepatocyte-like cells to model in vitro liver stage infec-
tions with P. berghei, P. yoelii, P. falciparum, and P.
vivax (Ng et al. 2015 ). It was found that P. yoelii and P.
falciparum infections of organoids recapitulated the
primaquine sensitivity found in vivo. Chua and col-
leagues (Chua et al. 2019 ) infected organoids derived
from simian and human hepatocytes, with P. cynomolgi
andP. vivax and found that organoids could support the
complete liver stage of both simian and human parasites,
from initial infection with sporozoites, to the release of
merozoites capable of erythrocyte infection. This study
also illustrated the use of infected organoids to evaluate
the response to an anti-relapse drug, highlighting the po-
tential for organoids as a parasite drug screening plat-
form, particularly in parasites with life-cycles longer
than their host cells.
Cancer
Colorectal cancer
Though organoids derived from tumor and matched
normal epithelial tissues provide valuable research tools
for cancer biology, one of the most remarkable improve-
ments in organoid research is the capacity to manipulate
the genomes, transcriptomes and epigenomes of normal
epithelial organoids to study the role of specific alter-
ations in the process of tumorigenesis.
Murine organoid cultures were firstly used to study
the early stages of tumorigenesis. Li and colleagues
(Li et al. 2014 ) adopted the ALI culture approach
combined with genetically engineered mouse model
and the retrovirus-mediated delivery of shRNA
constructs, to model multi-step tumorigenesis in
organoids derived from digestive tract, including the
colon, stomach, and pancreas. Pancreatic and gastric
organoids exhibited dysplasia as a result of expression
ofKrasG12D,p53 loss or both. While colon organoids
needed assembled Apc,p53,KrasG12Dand Smad4
mutations for malignant transformation to invasive
adenocarcinoma-like morphology. All engineered
organoids presented histologic characteristics of
adenocarcinoma after subcutaneous implantation was
performed to immunocompromised mice.Liet al. Cell Regeneration            (2020) 9:21 Page 15 of 33Following research tried to model multi-step tumori-
genesis of conventional CRC, which is characterized by
chromosomal instability (CIN) (Fig. 9). Drost and col-
leagues (Drost et al. 2015 ) adopted CRISPR-mediated
knock-out of the tumor suppressors APC,TP53 , and
SMAD4 , married with CRISPR-mediated knock-in of the
oncogenes KRASG12Dto model multi-step tumorigenesis.
After being selected by niche factors in the culture
media, cultures of organs were successfully built with
complex oncogenic multi-gene modules that contain up
to four simultaneous changes. The 4-hit AKST ( APC,
KRASG12D, SMAD4, and TP53 ) organoids could grow
without stem cell niche factors such as Wnt-3, R-
spondin-1 and EGF. AKST organoids were able to gen-
erate tumors with characteristics of invasive carcinoma
upon subcutaneous implantation into immunocom-
promised mice. Matano and colleagues (Matano et al.
2015 ) applied a similar method to model tumorigenesis
by inserting an additional CRISPR-mediated knock-in of
the oncogene PIK3CAE545,in addition to AKST. Both
studies showed that organoids with APC andTP53 mu-
tations showed extensive aneuploidy, which is the hall-
mark of the CIN pathway.
Xenotransplantation of engineered colorectal tumor
organoids makes it possible to study cancer stem cells
in vivo (de Sousa e Melo et al. 2017 ;Shimokawa et al.
2017 ) and leads to metastatic diseases, making organoids
a useful research tool to study metastasis mechanisms
(Fumagalli et al. 2017 ;Roper et al. 2017 ). de Sousa e
Melo and colleagues (de Sousa e Melo et al. 2017 ) com-
bined CRC mouse with the Lgr5DTR/eGFPallele. The
resulting animals carry two of the most frequently mu-
tated genes, Apc and KrasG12D, and in addition, express
a diphtheria toxin receptor fused to an eGFP under theendogenous regulatory region of Lgr5, allowing specific
elimination and visualization of Lgr5-positive stem cells.
Using this model, it was found that in the absence of
cancer stem cells, liver metastases did not occur,
whereas primary tumors did not regress, indicating that
Lgr5-positive cancer stem cells are required for metasta-
sis. In another study, Fumagalli and colleagues
(Fumagalli et al. 2017 ) orthotopically transplanted CRIS
PR-mediated KRAS, APC, TP53 , and SMAD4 co-
mutated human colon organoids into mice and showed
that metastases to the liver and lungs occurred in 44% of
the mice. Almost no metastasis occurred when orga-
noids carrying mutations in only three of these four
genes were transplanted to mice; however, the lack of
the fourth mutation could be overcome by providing the
niche factor upstream of the absent mutation. For ex-
ample, organoids with triple mutants lacking SMAD4 in-
activation metastasized when Noggin was added to the
cells. These findings indicate that metastatic potential is
directly related to the loss of niche factor dependency.
CRC that arises from the serrated neoplasia pathway is
different from CRC that arises from the conventional
CIN pathway. The activation of oncogene BRAF initiated
the serrated pathway, followed by the extensive hyper-
methylation of CpG island methylator phenotype, and
subsequent inactivation of tumor suppressor genes (Bae
and Kim 2016 ). Fessler and colleagues (Fessler et al.
2016 ) firstly built the organoids to model the serrated
pathway of CRC by introducing the BRAFV600Emutation
into normal human colon epithelial organoids via hom-
ologous recombination. They revealed that induction of
a mesenchymal phenotype upon TGF βtreatment pre-
vails in the BRAFV600Emutated organoids generating
sessile serrated adenomas (SSAs). In a recent study, by

organoids by using CRISPR-Cas9 technologyLiet al. Cell Regeneration            (2020) 9:21 Page 16 of 33analyzing the genomic data from TCGA, CRC-
associated gene alterations including BrafV600E,Cdkn2a ,
Tgfbr2 ,Znrf2 andRnf43, were selected to be introduced
into murine colon organoids using CRISPR-Cas9 tech-
nology to model the serrated pathway (Lannagan et al.
2019 ). Upon subcutaneous implantation into immuno-
compromised mice, these engineered organoids could
generate tumors with characteristics of serrated CRC, in-
cluding desmoplastic stromal responses, infiltrative
growth, mucinous differentiation, tumor budding, and
the formation of colon tumors spontaneously metasta-
sizing to the liver. To be pointed out, transplantation of
Braf-mutated organoids failed to generate tumors, while
injection of organoids with both mutations of Braf and
Tgfbr2 led to invasive adenocarcinoma. Implantation of
organoids with those and additional mutations ( Cdkn2a ,
Znrf2 and Rnf43 ) resulted in increased tumor initiation
and decreased survival time. Moreover, to study the de-
velopment of the R-spondin-driven serrated pathway,
another study also introduced CRISPR-mediated gene
fusions on BRAFV600Eand/or TP53 accompanied with
the R-spondin fusion EIF3E (Eukaryotic Translation Ini-
tiation Factor 3 Subunit E )-RSPO2 to normal human
colon epithelial organoids (Kawasaki et al. 2020 ). The
resulting BRAFV600Eorganoids showed aberrant crypt
formation ability with poor engraftment capacity, while
organoids with mutations of BRAFV600Eand TP53 with
EIF3E-RSPO2 fusion generated flatly elevated lesions
and hyperplastic crypt structures with ‘V’-shaped serra-
tion and basal dilation, together with enhanced engraft-
ment capacity compared with only BRAFV600Emutated
organoids.
The loss of DNA mismatch repair enzymes, such as
MutL homolog 1 (MLH1), is common in CRCs, result-
ing in tumors with high mutational load. These tumors
are characterized by microsatellite instability (MSI), as
repetitive short sequences in the genome, which leads to
changes in copy number following the loss of mismatch
repair enzymes. Drost and colleagues (Drost et al. 2017 )
used CRISPR-mediated knock-out of MLH1 and cul-
tured organoids for 2 months to allow accumulation of
mutations. Subsequent DNA analyses of cultured orga-
noids revealed an increase in mutational load compared
with controls, which was similar to that of MSI colorec-
tal tumors. This study shows that organoids faithfully re-
capitulate in vivo mutagenesis and allow for the
identification of mechanisms of tumor development.
In addition, rare type of colorectal cancer can also be
modeled based on organoid culture. Li and colleagues
(Li et al. 2019 ) have established a novel organoid line of
colon signet-ring cell carcinoma (SRCC), which accounts
for only 1% of colorectal cancers. The novel organoid
line resembles the primary tumor histologically and
molecularly, and can efficiently generate tumors onxenografts. Targeted DNA sequencing with drug screen-
ing of 88 compound identified that JAK2 (Janus Kinase
2) might be a potential treatment target. An in vitro
drug screening experiment exhibited that SRCC orga-
noids can be sensitively treated by AT9283 and Pacriti-
nib, two JAK2 inhibitors, which was consistent with the
in vivo xenograft response. The study provides a novel
in vitro research tool for colorectal SRCC and sets an ex-
ample for personalized medicine based on organoids for
rare cancer.
Pancreatic cancer
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) accounts for
about 90% of all pancreatic malignancies and over 90%
PDAC patients harbor activation of the oncogene KRAS .
KRAS can consequently induce inactivation of various
tumor suppressor genes including TP53 ,CDKN2A ,
SMAD4 and BRCA2 to accelerate PDAC development
and progression (Kanda et al. 2012 ;Morris and Wang
2010 ). Establishment of murine pancreatic organoids
bearing a lox-stop-lox (LSL) KrasG12D allele provided
valuable insights for the development of PDAC. In one
study (Li et al. 2014 ), pancreatic organoids derived from
LSL-KrasG12D(K), Tp53flox/flox(P), and LSL-KRasG12D;
Tp53flox/flox(KP) mice were successfully built using ALI
method. K, P, and KP organoids exhibited in vitro dys-
plasia and increased invasive behavior, and could in vivo
generate well differentiated to poorly differentiated
adenocarcinoma upon implantation into immunocom-
promised NOG mice. KP organoids had most poorly dif-
ferentiated morphology, with significant loss of E-
cadherin, indicating increased epithelial to mesenchymal
transition. Researchers of another study generated low-
grade preinvasive pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias
(PanINs) in vivo by crossing the murine LSL-KrasG12D
allele to a pancreas-specific Pdx1-Cre driver and orga-
noids derived from PanIN lesions could be long-term
expanded a produce PanIN-like lesions that persisted for
up to 2 months upon transplantation (Boj et al. 2015 ).
Two studies have adopted CRISPR-Cas9 technology to
manipulate PDAC driver genes including KRASG12V,
CDKN2A ,TP53 and SMAD4 (KCTS) in normal human
pancreatic ductal organoids (Lee et al. 2017 ;Seino et al.
2018 ). Upon orthotopically transplantation to immuno-
compromising mice, different combinations of mutants
in organoids exhibited distinct PanINs features, but only
KCTS organoids displayed PDAC histopathological
transformation (Seino et al. 2018 ). Notably, KC and KT
organoids died after WNT removal for 1-3 weeks, while
KCT and KCTS organoids survived and expanded for at
least 3 months, suggesting that CDKN2A andTP53 mu-
tations are essential for organoids to grow independently
of stem cell niche factors (Seino et al. 2018 ). In all, these
studies indicate that organoids combined with CRISPR-Liet al. Cell Regeneration            (2020) 9:21 Page 17 of 33mediated sequential mutations can recapitulate tumori-
genesis and progression from PanIN to PDAC. More-
over, organoids could also be used to explore the roles
of various factors such as the redox regulator NRF2 and
the transcriptional enhancer FOXA1 in PDAC progres-
sion (Chio et al. 2016 ;Roe et al. 2017 ). Further researches
are need to apply the improved knowledge of molecular
mechanisms to clinics.
Gastric cancer
Gastric cancer are classified into four molecular subtypes
based on deep sequencing: Epstein-Barr virus positive,
MSI, CIN and genomically stable (Cancer Genome Atlas
Research 2014 ). Nanki and colleagues (Nanki et al. 2018 )
adopted organoids to illustrate the genotype-phenotype
associations of gastric cancer. Phenotype analyses of
organoids derived from gastric cancer patients indicated
multiple genetic and epigenetic ways to confer Wnt and
R-spondin niche independency. They found that induc-
tion of RNF43 andZNRF43 mutations was sufficient for
gastric cancer organoids to gain R-spondin indepen-
dency. The phenomenon was then validated in CRISPR-
Cas9 engineered gastric organoids. In a similar study,
Seidlitz and colleagues (Seidlitz et al. 2019 ) generated
human and murine gastric cancer organoids which reca-
pitulated the typical features and altered pathways of
each of four molecular subtypes of gastric cancer. The
combination of organoids and CRISPR-Cas9 technolo-
gies promotes research on the molecular mechanisms of
gastric cancer tumorigenesis and progression, thereby
accelerating the development of preclinical gastric can-
cer models for novel drug development and personalized
medicine.
Breast cancer
Recently, Dekkers and colleagues (Dekkers et al. 2019 )
attempted to model multi-step carcinogenesis in breast
epithelial organoids derived from human reduction
mammoplasties using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. They
introduced CRISPR-mediated knock-out of four breast
cancer-associated tumor suppressor genes, including
P53, PTEN, RB1 and NF1 (PTRN) to mammary progeni-
tor cells. Mutated organoids could long-term expanded
and generated ER+ luminal tumors upon transplantation
into mice for 1 out of 6 PTR-mutated and 3 out of 6
PTRN-mutated organoid lines. These organoids had
various response to endocrine therapy or chemotherapy,
indicating the potential application of this model to fa-
cilitate our understanding of the molecular mechanisms
in specific subtypes of breast cancer.
Prostate cancer
In prostate cancers, 40-80% of tumors harbor a gene fu-
sion between the androgen receptor (AR)-responsivetransmembrane protease serine 2 ( TMPRSS2 ) gene and
E26 transformation-specific (ETS) family transcription
factor, most often the oncogene ETS-related gene (ERG)
(Tomlins et al. 2005 ). TMPRSS2 and ERG, both located
on chromosome 21, are separated by about 3 million
base pairs. Using CRISPR-Cas9, a TMPRSS2-ERG fusion
was successfully introduced into mouse prostate
organoids using a template that brought these two DNA
regions together. This genetic alteration resulted in AR-
mediated overexpression of ERG, an effect that can be
prevented by androgen receptor antagonist, consistent
with those seen in vivo (Driehuis 2017 ).
Organoids for translational research
Living organoid biobanks as a tool for personalized
treatment and drug development
As mentioned above, organoids can be efficiently estab-
lished from patient-derived normal and tumor tissue
samples, which can be cryopreserved and stored in living
organoid biobanks. PDOs resemble the tumor epithe-
lium they were derived from both phenotypically and
genetically. However, molecular profile alone is not suffi-
cient to adequately predict drug sensitivity. Even in pa-
tients with the same genotype, drug response varies.
Besides, some mutations are rare, thus clinical trials are
impossible and efficacy testing is required for drugs to
be conducted on an individual basis. Thus, combined
molecular and therapeutic profiling of PDOs may help
predict treatment response and contribute to personal-
ized cancer treatment and drug development.
Gastrointestinal cancer
A number of organoid biobanks have been reported
since 2014 (Table 3). A colon cancer derived biobank of
22 lines was established in 2015, setting an example for
a standard biobank (van de Wetering et al. 2015 ). All
samples performed RNA sequencing and whole genome
sequencing analysis. The molecular characteristics of
PDOs cover all five consensus molecular subtypes of
CRC. The mutations in the organoids were largely con-
cordant with the original tumors, which was validated in
a set of organoids established of colorectal metastases
(Weeber et al. 2015 ). High-throughput screening of a
panel of 83 compounds found that differences in drug
sensitivity among the organoid lines that in some cases
correlated with specific mutation. For example, RNF43-
mutant organoids were sensitive to WNT secretion in-
hibitors, and KRAS-mutant organoids were resistant to
the EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) inhibitors,
including cetuximab and afatinib.
Later, Schutte and colleagues (Schütte et al. 2017 ) re-
ported a biobank of 35 organoid lines from CRC. They
found that organoid models reproduce most the genetic
and transcriptomic characteristics of the donors, butLiet al. Cell Regeneration            (2020) 9:21 Page 18 of 33Table 3 List of biobanks of different tumor types

sence of stroma. Drug screening with therapeutic com-
pounds representing the standard of care for CRC,
combined with molecular profiles, helped identify a sig-
nature outperforming RAS/RAF mutation which has
predictive value for sensitivity to the EGFR inhibitor
cetuximab.
Drug response in organoids and clinical response was
also observed to prove that the in vitro organoid re-
sponse correlates with the in vivo response. A clinical
study of PDOs derived from metastatic gastroesophageal
and CRC showed a strong correlation (100% sensitivity,
93% specificity, 88% positive predictive value, and 100%
negative predictive value) between the in vitro organoid
response to a set of targeted therapies and chemother-
apies and the response of the tumor in patients (Vlacho-
giannis et al. 2018 ). Another study adopted organoids
for colon cancer chemoprediction showing that PDOs
test predicted more than 80% of patients ’response
treated with irinotecan-based therapies (Ooft et al.
2019 ). Together, these studies indicate the potential of
tumor-derived organoids to predict patients ’responses.
Recently, two studies showed the applications of PDOs
derived from rectal cancer to predicting patient re-
sponses to neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy. Yao
and colleagues (Yao et al. 2020 ) generated a rectal can-
cer derived biobank (N=80) and tested PDOs ’sensitivity
to 5-FU, irinotecan, or radiation. They incorporated a
correlation between in vitro responses in organoids and
the histopathologically determined tumor regression
scores (TRGs) after surgical resection to define prognos-
tic cut-offs. Using these parameters, the in vitro re-
sponses could predict clinical responses with an
impressive area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88 and an
accuracy of 84%. In the other study, Ganesh and col-
leagues (Ganesh et al. 2019 ) established 65 PDO lines
from rectal cancer to test responses to neoadjuvant che-
moradiation therapy, including the standard FOLFOX
chemotherapy and radiation. The PDO responses signifi-
cantly reflected the patients ’progression-free survival.
Moreover, PDOs generated invasive rectal cancer
followed by metastasis upon transplantation into murine
rectal mucosa, exhibiting the same in vivo metastatic
route as in the corresponding patients.For pancreatic cancer, Boj and colleagues (Boj et al.
2015 ) were the first to successfully developed organoids
from patient-derived PDACs. Subsequently, Seino and
colleagues (Seino et al. 2018 ) generate an extensive orga-
noids biobank of PDACs (N=39) covering both classical
and basal subtypes according to gene expression signa-
tures. They found basal-type PDACs derived organoids
are more independent of Wnt signaling, which are more
invasive and aggressive clinically, indicating that progres-
sion of PDACs are accompanied by loss of stem cell
niche dependence. Recently, Tiriac and colleagues (Tir-
iac et al. 2018 ) generated a much larger PDAC biobank
(N=114) and exposed a subset of these organoid lines to
the standard-of-care chemotherapies. Their sensitivities
paralleled clinical responses in patients. Besides, gene ex-
pression signatures of chemosensitivity based on orga-
noids were developed to help predict responses to
chemotherapy in both the adjuvant and advanced disease
settings. By high throughput drug screening, they nomi-
nated alternative treatment strategies for chemo-
refractory PDO. Another study also used PDOs (N=30)
to identify novel therapeutics to target pancreatic tumor
cells in a biobank covering different histological sub-
types, including PDACs, acinar cell carcinoma, cholan-
giocarcinoma, adenosquamous-PDACs, intraductal
papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN)-derived PDACs
and papilla of Vater adenocarcinomas (Driehuis et al.
2019c ). PDOs were exposed to 76 therapeutic agents
currently not exploited in the clinic. The PRMT5 (Pro-
tein Arginine Methyltransferase 5) inhibitor, EZP015556,
was shown to target MTAP (methylthioadenosine phos-
phorylase)-negative tumors, but also appeared to consti-
tute an effective therapy for a subset of MTAP-positive
tumors, indicating the importance of personalized ap-
proaches for cancer treatment.
Huch and colleagues (Broutier et al. 2017 ) described
a liver tumor biobank (N=13) containing hepatocellu-
lar carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma, as well as the
rarer lymphoepithelioma-like cholangiocarcinoma. In
drug screening experiments with 29 compounds, the
ERK (extracellular regulated protein kinases) inhibitor
SCH772984 was found to effectively inhibit the
growth of tumor organoids, which was validated
in vivo using xenotransplanted organoid lines in mice,Table 3 List of biobanks of different tumor types (Continued)

Biliary tract carcinomas-derived organoids biobank
was also established, covering intrahepatic cholangiocar-
cinoma, gallbladder cancer, and neuroendocrine carcin-
oma of the ampulla of Vater (Saito et al. 2019 ). Gene
expression profiling of the organoids indicated that
SOX2, KLK6 and CPB2 could be potential prognostic
biomarkers. Drug screening using a compound library of
339 drugs showed that the antifungal drugs, amorolfine
and fenticonazole, significantly suppressed the growth of
biliary tract carcinomas organoids with little toxicity to
normal biliary epithelial cells.
Genitourinary cancer
The organoids biobank of metastatic prostate cancer
covering both AR (androgen receptor)-positive and
-negative subtypes was the first reported biobank estab-
lished by Gao and colleagues (Gao et al. 2014 ). The bio-
bank captured the most common genetic aberrations in
prostate cancer, including TMPRSS2 –ERG fusion, homo-
zygous deletions of PTEN and CHD1 , as well as typical
copy number variations. To be pointed out, organoids
derived from circulating tumor cells were also success-
fully established in this biobank, showing that at least in
some cases, organoids can be established from less inva-
sive blood samples.
A bladder cancer derived organoids biobank (N=20)
was established containing urothelial carcinomas and
one squamous cell carcinoma (Lee et al. 2018 ). Organoid
lines were interconvertible with orthotopic xenografts
and recapitulated the mutational spectrum of the corre-
sponding tumor type, including activation of FGFR3 and
mutations in epigenetic regulators such as ARID1A.
Drug screening of 40 compounds based bladder tumor
organoids showed partial correlations with mutational
profiles as well as treatment resistance, and the drug re-
sponses can be validated using xenografts in vivo .
Women ’s cancers
A biobank of breast cancer organoids (N=95) has been
described covering major histological subtypes (invasive
ductal carcinoma and invasive lobular carcinoma) and
all molecular subtypes based on gene expression (Sachs
et al. 2018 ). Organoid morphologies matched the histo-
pathology of the original tumors, and hormone receptor
[estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR)],
HER2 status and copy number variations were retained.
ER and PR status have predictive value for the outcome
of endocrine therapy (e.g. tamoxifen), while HER2 is a
target for targeted therapy (e.g. trastuzumab) and also
has predictive value for chemotherapy outcome. The re-
sponse of breast cancer-derived organoids to HER2 in-
hibitor afatinib and to endocrine therapy tamoxifen wereconsistent with in vivo xeno-transplantations and patient
response in clinic.
An organoid biobank of high-grade serous ovarian can-
cer (HGSC) (N=33) was established by Hill and colleagues
(Hill et al. 2018 ). Up to 50% of all patients with HGSC
have DNA repair defects, typically mutation of BRCA1 or
BRCA2 . These patients were thought to benefit from
treatment with poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in-
hibitors. In the clinical setting, mutation analysis alone is
not sufficient to adequately predict drug sensitivity. The
study showed that functional assays in organoids are a
better predictor than the genomic analysis in clinic, imply-
ing that functional assays in organoids may improve the
prediction of drug sensitivity beyond what can be achieved
with genomic analysis alone. Kopper and colleagues (Kop-
per et al. 2019 ) established a second ovarian cancer bio-
bank (N=56) that captured all of the main histological
subtypes, including borderline tumors, endometroid car-
cinomas, mucinous carcinomas, LGSC and HGSC. Not-
ably, a novel single-cell DNA sequencing method was
used to demonstrate intra-patient heterogeneity was pre-
served in organoids when compared with the original
tumor. PDOs can be used for drug-screening analyses and
capture distinct responses of different histological sub-
types to platinum-based chemotherapy, including acquisi-
tion of chemoresistance in recurrent disease. Besides,
PDOs can also be xenografted, enabling in vivo drug sensi-
tivity analyses. Taken together, PDOs of ovarian cancer
have potential application for translational research and
precision medicine.
Head and neck cancer
Driehuis and colleagues (Driehuis et al. 2019a ) established
an organoid biobank (N=31) derived from head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). PDOs recapitulates
genetic and molecular characteristics of original HNSCCs
and can generate tumors upon transplantation to im-
munocompromised mice. The authors observe different
responses to commonly used drugs in clinic including cis-
platin, carboplatin, cetuximab, and radiotherapy in vitro .
Besides, drug screens exhibit selective sensitivity to tar-
geted drugs that are not normally used in clinic for pa-
tients with HNSCC. These findings may inspire the
personalized treatment of HNSCC and expand the list of
HNSCC drugs. In another study, the authors reported
PDOs derived from HNSCC can also be used to evaluate
their response to targeted photodynamic therapy and to
ensure the safety of the treatment at the same time by
testing it on organoids derived from matched normal tis-
sues (Driehuis et al. 2019b ).
Glioblastoma
All organoids discussed above were derived from tumors
of epithelial origin, known as carcinomas. RecentLiet al. Cell Regeneration            (2020) 9:21 Page 21 of 33advances show organoids derived from primary glio-
blastoma tissue, setting the stage for growing organoids
from non-epithelial tumors (Hubert et al. 2016 ).
Glioblastoma presents great heterogeneity, and thus it ’s
difficult to generate an ideal in vitro model which can
recapitulate the in vivo situation of the donor. By modi-
fying the method to develop cerebral organoids, the
PDOs can be successfully derived both from primary le-
sion of glioblastoma and from brain metastases. Once
formed, PDOs presented hypoxia gradients and mim-
icked cancer stem cell heterogeneity with rapidly divid-
ing outer cells surrounding the hypoxic core of
differentiated cells and diffuse, quiescent cancer stem
cells. Drug testing based on organoids showed that non-
stem cells were sensitive to radiation therapy, whereas
adjacent cancer stem cells were radioresistant. Orthoto-
pic transplantation of PDOs resulted in tumors recapitu-
lating histological features of the parental tumor.
Based on this method, Jacob et al. ( 2020 ) established a
larger organoid biobank derived from glioblastoma (N=
70), recapitulating the histological characteristics, cellu-
lar diversity, gene expression, and mutational profiles of
their donors. The organoids generated rapid, aggressively
infiltrated tumors upon transplantation into adult rodent
brains. The authors observe different responses to ex-
posure of radiation with concurrent temozolomide,
which was consistent with the patients ’response and
survival in clinic. Notably, the authors further demon-
strate the utility of organoids in modeling immunother-
apy by co-culture of chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-
T) cells with organoids. They observed specific tumor
cells were targeted and killed by CAR-T cells. The study
expands the application of PDOs in personalized treat-
ment to include immunotherapy.
Mixed tumors
Several biobanks containing organoids derived from
mixed cancers were established for pan-cancer research.
Pauli et al. ( 2017a ,2017b ) developed a robust precision
cancer platform, by integrating whole exome sequencing
with a living biobank which allows high throughput drug
screens on PDOS. The biobank included tumors derived
from prostate, breast, colorectum, esophagus, brain, pan-
creas, lung, small intestine, ovary, uterus, soft tissue,
bladder, ureter and kidney. In another study, to model
tumor immune microenvironment, Kuo and colleagues
(Neal et al. 2018 ) established PDOs based on ALI
method from >100 individual patient tumors of 19 dis-
tinct organs and 28 histological subtypes. These PDOs
included common cancers such as colon, pancreas, and
lung, and rarer histologies such as bile duct ampullary
adenocarcinoma, brain schwannoma, and salivary gland
pleomorphic adenoma. PDOs in this biobank retain im-
mune cells and should enable immuno-oncologyinvestigations and facilitate personalized immunotherapy
testing.
Cystic fibrosis
As mentioned above, CF is a lethal genetic disease
caused by CFTR mutations that impairs the function of
many organs including the intestine, lung, pancreas,
sweat gland, liver, and kidney. The disease is character-
ized by the buildup of viscous, sticky mucus which clogs
airways, causes chronic digestive system problems and
leads to CF-related diabetes. Approximately 2,000 CF-
causing mutations of CFTR have been described, and
drug efficacy varies among the different genotypes (Cut-
ting 2015 ). Thus, there is a need for a personalized
medicine approach to predict treatment response.
Beekman and colleagues (Dekkers et al. 2016 ) first
established an organoid biobank derived from rectum of
71 CF patients with 28 different CFTR genotypes. Based
on the biobanking, they developed a personalized
medicine approach by using FSK-induced swelling assay
to select clinical responders to CF modulators. Two pa-
tients with the rare and uncharacterized F508del/
G1249R genotype responded in vitro to a specific CF
modulator, ivacaftor (KALYDECO, Vertex Pharmaceuti-
cals). The responses were consistent with their in vivo
clinical response to the treatment, reflected by improved
pulmonary function and sweat chloride tests. In a
prospective follow-up study involving 24 participants
(Berkers et al. 2019 ), the predictive power of the FSK
assay was further substantiated, as the in vitro assay
correlated with changes in pulmonary function and
sweat chloride tests conducted in vivo . Besides CF-rectal
organoids, pancreatic organoids and cholangiocyte-like
organoids derived of CF-iPSCs have also shown the
potential for drug screening (Sampaziotis et al. 2015 ;
Simsek et al. 2016 ). In the Netherlands, the licensing of
ORKAMBI (lumacaftor/ivacaftor, Vertex Pharmaceuti-
cals) allows treatment of CF patients solely based on a
positive organoid swelling response, demonstrating the
potential of organoid-based assays for delivering person-
alized medicine (Fig. 10).
In summary, organoid biobanks have been established
for multiple tumor types (Table 3), including non-
epithelial glioblastoma, and several principals can be
concluded. First, PDOs can be established from small
biological samples, such as biopsies and even circulating
tumor cells, and these organoids can generate tumors
upon xenotransplantation. Second, the PDOs in bio-
banks recapitulate histological and genetic aspects of the
original tumors, which holds not only for localized
primary tumors but also for metastatic tumors. Third,
high-throughput drug screening experiments in orga-
noids correlate with the response in patients and lead
the identification of new therapeutic targets. CombiningLiet al. Cell Regeneration            (2020) 9:21 Page 22 of 33genetic sequencing with functional assays in PDOs will
facilitate personalized treatment, even including im-
munotherapy, which will be discussed in detail in Sec-
tion 3.4.
Genetic repair in organoids
Schwank and colleagues (Schwank et al. 2013 ) firstly
demonstrated that it is feasible to repair genetic defects
in organoids. Intestinal organoids derived from two CF
patients with a homozygous CFTR F508 deletion were
repaired using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. After repair,
FSK-induced swelling was restored, functionally demon-
strating CFTR activity. Later, Firth and colleagues (Firth
et al. 2015 ) generated iPSCs from CF patients with a
homozygous deletion of CFTR F508 and corrected this
mutation using CRISPR technology to target corrective
sequences to endogenous CFTR genomic locus,
combining with selection system. The corrected iPSCs-
organoids were able to differentiate mature airway epi-
thelial cells with normal CFTR expression and function.
However, CFTR gene repair in organoids and subse-
quent transplantation into patients is hard to be applied
in the clinic. First, the loss of CFTR functions results in
disease in multiple organ systems, which would require
the transplantation of organoids into multiple tissue
sites. Second, a high percentage of repaired cells per
organ would be required for functional restoration.
Third, ethics problems in organoids transplantation are
controversial and needs to reach a consensus in the re-
search field.
Organoids transplantation
Human and murine organoids have been orthotopically
transplanted into mice to model disease or to show
tumorigenic potential. Here, we discuss studies that used
organoid transplantation as therapy.Yui and colleagues (Yui et al. 2012 ) firstly exploited
the feasibility to apply organoids to repair damaged epi-
thelium. GFP+murine colon organoids derived from
Lgr5+stem cells were reintroduced into mice with DSS
(Dextran Sulfate Sodium Salt) -induced acute colitis.
Transplanted cells readily integrated into the mouse
colon and covered superficially damaged tissue. 4 weeks
after transplantation, the donor cells constituted a
single-layered epithelium, which formed functionally and
histologically normal crypts that were able to self-renew.
Further, engrafted mice had higher body weights than
ungrafted ones, indicating that donor cells contributed
to the recovery of DSS-induced acute colitis. Although
further optimization is still needed, the current study in-
dicates that in vitro expansion and transplantation of
organoids may be a promising treatment choice for pa-
tients with severe gastrointestinal epithelial injuries.
Orthotopic transplantation of liver organoids has also
shown promising results. In a mouse model of toxicity-
induced acute liver failure, transplantation of mouse dif-
ferentiated biliary duct organoids derived from Lgr5+
stem cells generated detectable organoid-derived nod-
ules in 20-40% of cases (Huch et al. 2013 ). Although en-
graftment rate was low (approximately 1%), a significant
increase in survival of the grafted group was observed
compared to the ungrafted group, indicating that the
transplanted cells contributed to liver function repair
(Huch et al. 2013 ). In follow-up studies using the same
injury model, the transplantation of mouse (Peng et al.
2018 ) and human fetal (Hu et al. 2018 ) hepatocyte orga-
noids, generated much more extensive engraftment indi-
cating that the efficiency of engraftment may be
enhanced by transplantation of the most physiologically
relevant cell type.
Recently, Xiao and colleagues (Xiao and Deng 2020 )
generated induced sensory ganglion organoids exhibiting
Fig. 10 Organoids for modeling cystic fibrosis (CF) and its multiple applications. Organ-specific pathologies of CF can be studied separately using
organoids derived from distinct tissues and applied to personalized drug screeningLiet al. Cell Regeneration            (2020) 9:21 Page 23 of 33molecular features, subtype diversity, electrophysio-
logical and calcium response properties, and innervation
patterns characteristic of peripheral sensory neurons,
which may serve as a source for cell replacement ther-
apy. Yoshihara and colleagues (Yoshihara and O'Connor
2020 ) generated human islet-like organoids (HILOs)
from iPSC, which provides a promising alternative to ca-
daveric and device-dependent therapies in the treatment
of diabetes. HILOs contain endocrine-like cell types that,
upon transplantation, rapidly re-establish glucose
homeostasis in diabetic NOD/SCID mice. Overexpres-
sion of the PD-L1 protected HILO xenografts such that
they were able to restore glucose homeostasis in
immune-competent diabetic mice.
Organoids combined with 3D printing were recently in-
troduced to build the 3D architecture of tissue, which may
find widespread applications in regenerative medicine.
Firstly, Zhang and his colleagues (Zhang et al. 2016 )e s t a b -
lished the technique that can be transformed into human
cardiomyocytes derived from iPSCs to construct endothe-
lialized human myocardium. Then, Creff and colleagues
(Creff et al. 2019 ) provided the possibility of creating arti-
ficial 3D scaffolds that match the size and structure of
mouse intestinal crypt and villi. Moreover, Homan and
colleagues (Homan et al. 2019 ) built a model that had the
ability to induce substantial vascularization and morpho-
genesis of renal organs in vitro under flow conditions
opening up a new way for the study of renal development,
disease and regeneration.
Though above studies indicate the potential applica-
tion of organoids in regenerative medicine, many prob-
lems need to be solved before organoids are put into
clinical use. For example, integration upon transplant-
ation requires optimization, and animal-based 3D ECM
matrix used for organoid culture need to be replaced
with a synthetic matrix.
Organoids as a tool for immunotherapy
The tumor microenvironment consists of various non-
epithelial cell types, including immune cells and stromal
cells, which greatly affects therapeutic responses. How-
ever, it is a major challenge to model tumor microenvir-
onment. Much of our knowledge regarding the tumor
microenvironment was studied on cell lines and PDX
models. However, cell lines are insufficient to recapitulate
the heterogeneity of tumor cells, while the microenviron-
ment of PDX models mainly depend on the mouse im-
mune system, which cannot adequately recapitulate the
human immune system. Cancer immunotherapy has
emerged as a promising therapeutic developments that
take advantage of a patient ’s own immune system to eradi-
cate tumor cells (Mellman and Coukos 2011 ), and several
organoid-based models have been established to study im-
munotherapy response (Fig. 11).Holistic approach based on ALI culture method
Recently, a holistic approach based on the ALI method
(mentioned in Section 1.2), which preserved the tumor
epithelium and its stromal microenvironment in vitro,
was described using PDOs of various cancer types, in-
cluding colorectal and lung cancers (Neal et al. 2018 ). In
addition to stromal fibroblasts, cellular immune compo-
nents such as tumor-associated macrophages, CTLs
(Cytotoxic T lymphocyte), T H cells (T helper cells), B
cells, natural killer (NK) cells and natural killer T (NKT)
cells were also readily maintained for up to 30 days in
the organoid cultures. The organoid cultures also pre-
served the T cell receptor (TCR) heterogeneity of the T
cells found in the parental tumor. The authors used
these organoids to model immune checkpoint blockade,
leading to the expansion and activation of tumor
antigen-specific T cells and subsequent killing of tumor
cells.
Reductionist approach based on WENR epithelial culture
method
Adoptive cell therapy is a promising immunotherapy. In
this method, autologous immune cells are expanded
in vitro followed by the subsequent transplantation of
these cells back into the patient, to enhance the immune
response against a tumor. Using this strategy, durable re-
gression of melanoma was achieved by in vitro expan-
sion of autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)
(Rosenberg 2015 ). However, this approach requires
resected specimens from which TILs can be obtained. A
strategy to avoid resection is to isolate peripheral blood
lymphocytes, activate these cells in vitro by co-culture
with tumor cells. For this strategy, tumor-derived orga-
noids are a highly useful source of tumor cells for co-
culture: Tumor organoid cultures can be efficiently
established from a small tissue sample through biopsy,
and tumor-derived organoids are heterogeneous and re-
capitulate the genetic and histological characteristics of
the parental tumors. Dijkstra and colleagues (Dijkstra
et al. 2018 ) were thus able to obtain tumor-reactive T
lymphocytes from peripheral blood lymphocytes after 2
weeks of co-culture with tumor organoids derived from
non –small cell lung cancer and MSI-H CRC. Before co-
culture, organoids were stimulated with IFN- γto
enhance antigen presentation. PD-1 blocking antibody,
IL-2, and anti-CD28 were added to enhance T cell acti-
vation. After co-culture, T lymphocytes were activated,
as demonstrated by expression of IFN- γand CD107a.
Accordingly, after an additional 3 days of co-culture of
activated T lymphocytes with tumor organoids, the sur-
vival of the tumor organoids was reduced, while
matched normal organoids were unaffected.
Cancers with low mutational burden and stable tumor
antigen presentation may be suitable targets for chimericLiet al. Cell Regeneration            (2020) 9:21 Page 24 of 33antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T cells. Studies on B
cell malignancies showed promising results (June 2018 ).
In solid tumors, the therapeutic application of CAR T
cells has been hindered by side effects that arise from
targeting overexpressed native antigens that are, not ex-
clusively expressed by tumors. Thus, for solid tumors,
preclinical models are needed to allow for CAR-
mediated cytotoxicity testing. Recently, a luciferase-
based quantification assay has been developed to test
CAR T cell-mediated cytotoxicity against PDOs
(Schnalzger et al. 2019 ). Instead of using CAR-
engineered T cells, the researchers adopted an NK cell
line with non-MHC restricted cytolytic activity to target
research. The efficiency of the system was confirmed by
using CAR-engineered NK-92 cells directed towardEPCAM , an epithelial marker overexpressed by cancers.
CAR-mediated cytotoxicity was observed against orga-
noids derived from both normal colon tissue and CRC
tissue presenting either peptide (Schnalzger et al. 2019 ).
Subsequently, the authors engineered CARs targeting
EGFRvIII, a neoantigen that is widely expressed by solid
cancers. In a competitive co-culture assay, EGFRvIII-
specific CAR NK cells killed EGFRvIII-expressing orga-
noids derived from tumors efficiently but not organoids
derived from normal tissue. Finally, the team generated
CARs targeting antigens specific to subgroup of CRC
that overexpress the WNT ligand receptor FZD upon
loss of expression of its antagonists RNF43 /ZNRF3 .T o
test possible side effects of FZD-specific CARs, the au-
thors evaluated cytotoxicity against normal colon

Holistic approach (up). Tumor biopsies are cultured in ALI in the entire tumor microenvironment as a cell suspension of all cell types, including
immune cells and other non-epithelial cell types. bReductionist approach (down), epithelial organoids are derived from tumor biopsies and are
then co-cultured with autologous immune cells derived from the peripheral blood of the same patient. CRC, colorectal cancer; ALI, air-liquid

deficient for both RNF43 andZNRF3 or for APC. These
co-culture assays illustrated that the cytolytic activity of
the FZD-specific CAR NK cells was not specific to the
mutated organoid lines, suggesting that such approaches
may have marked side effects if used therapeutically.
Though effective target has not been found, the platform
can be widely used to evaluate CAR efficacy and tumor
specificity in a personalized manner.
In summary, co-cultures of cancer organoids and im-
mune cells have become a highly promising strategy for
personalized immunotherapy for cancer patients.
Challenges
Organoids are robust research tools for the study of hu-
man development and disease. However, there are hurdles
and limitations associated with using organoids (Fig. 12).
First, culture approaches are not standardized. ASCs-
derived organoids are established under distinct culture
conditions in each laboratory. To reduce the cost, cost-
efficient small molecule compounds were used to replace
growth factors (Li et al. 2018 ;Yin et al. 2014 ). Besides,
homemade niche factors produced by various cell lineshas been used commonly to culture organoids. However,
this trend will result in experimental variation into orga-
noid studies across different research labs.
Second, organoid culture requires the use of Matrigel
or other animal-based matrix extract to enable cells to
aggregate into 3D structures. These extracts suffer from
batch-to-batch variability in their composition, which
may affect the reproducibility of experiments. In
addition, they may carry unknown pathogens and are
potentially immunogenic when transplanted to humans,
limiting the application of organoids in a clinical trans-
plantation setting. This may be solved by culturing with
clinical grade collagen, which has been successfully used
for colon organoids culture and expansion (Yui et al.
2012 ). Steps toward fully defined culture conditions have
been made with the development of a synthetic poly-
ethylene glycol-based gel that sustains the short-term
growth of mouse ASC-derived intestinal organoids
(Gjorevski et al. 2016 ). However, this matrix remains to
be optimized for the long-term expansion of intestinal
organoids and f non-intestinal organoids.
Third, obtaining pure tumor organoids is another crit-
ical problem for researchers. Many studies have reported
Fig. 12 Schematic summarize of current limitations in organoids culture development (yellow) and methods to overcome these issues (brown)Liet al. Cell Regeneration            (2020) 9:21 Page 26 of 33that tumor organoids can be overgrown and contami-
nated by matched normal organoids. One of the most
widely used methods to acquire pure tumor organoids is
to select tumor cells that harbor the most common mu-
tations in its cancer type. For example, tumor organoids
derived from CRC can be selectively upon withdrawal of
Wnt3a and R-Spondin1. However, this method is not
applicable to all cancers, and some specific cancer sub-
types. More importantly, intra-tumoral heterogeneity
would inevitably be lost upon selection. Some labs have
suggested obtaining pure tumor organoids based on
growth phenotypes. However, not all tumor organoids
have clear morphological differences to normal orga-
noids. More researches are needed to establish appropri-
ate approaches for obtaining pure tumor organoids.
Fourth, for ASCs-derived organoids, only the epithelial
compartment of organs is represented, while blood ves-
sels, immune cells, stroma, and nerves are lacking. As
mentioned above, many groups have focused co-
culturing organoids with various types of cells, analogous
to what has already been done with immune cells (Dijk-
stra et al. 2018 ), or adopted unconventional organoid
culture methods, such as the ALI method (Neal et al.
2018 ;Ootani et al. 2009 ). Besides, several PSC-based
organoids are able to undergo mesenchymal differenti-
ation to generate subepithelial myofibroblasts and
smooth muscle (Spence et al. 2011 ).
Last, the development of a model based on living hu-
man tissues that can be stored and expanded in
biobanks-potentially forever-has raised a set of ethical is-
sues regarding informed consent and ownership (Brede-
noord et al. 2017 ). For organoid biobanks, patient
consent is required. The most common type of patient
consent restricts the use of a patient ’s material to only a
specific research aim. However, biobanks are useful for
researchers in multiple fields, and the use of biobanks in
a combination of fields may provide potentially synergis-
tic data. To solve this problem, Bredenoord and col-
leagues (Boers and van Delden 2015 ;Bredenoord et al.
2017 ) have suggested that a broad consent be used for
governance. This broad consent would allow donors to
make informed decisions about how their samples are
used after they have been provided with relevant infor-
mation about the establishment and regulation of the
biobank. Another issue that has arisen with the develop-
ment of living biobanks is ownership. Organoids are in-
creasingly used by commercial parties as tools for drug
development or in validation studies. Such uses will in-
evitably result in patentable compounds. It may be help-
ful to include regulations covering the distribution of
any financial gains from intellectual property among
stakeholders in the governance of the biobanks.
Furthermore, in terms of the culture conditions of
tumor organoids, intra-tumoral heterogeneity could belost during passages for that the culture media might
not favor the growth of all tumor subclones equally ef-
fectively. Additionally, novel mutations would be ac-
quired during long-term expansion. Collectively, these
drawbacks deserve further attention, and more work is
needed to improve organoids culture technologies.
Despite these limitations, organoid technology holds
great promise as a robust tool for basic, translational
and clinical research for human development and dis-
ease modeling.
Outlooks
In this review, we have demonstrated the potential of
organoid technology for modeling genetic, infectious
and malignant disease, as well as for drug development
and personalized medicine. The basic and translational
applications of organoids are expected to expand in the
future.
Regarding epithelial genetics, organoids have potential
especially for rare diseases due to their high expansion
ability and genetic stability. In infectious diseases, the
mechanisms of virus-induced malignant transformation,
for example, by Epsteini-Barr virus in gastric and naso-
pharynx cancers, may be studied in long-term co-
cultures of the virus with normal epithelium from the
respective organ. In the studies of malignancies, culture
conditions need to be developed for many types of car-
cinomas and for sarcomas and melanomas.
The optimization of drug screening will be a pivotal
use of organoids in personalized medicine by adopting
biobanks of different cancers. This enables many com-
pounds to be screened for a specific disease or a specific
compound to be screened for many forms of a given dis-
ease. Moreover, multiple organoids can be derived from
the same cancer patient over time to assess drug re-
sponse and developing resistance to targeted drugs and
to predict patient outcome.
In the area of regenerative medicine, there is still a
long way to go for the transplantation of organoids as
therapy. Several hurdles, including the development of a
non-animal-based alternative for Matrigel and efficient
delivery procedures, remain to be overcome.
In conclusion, the worldwide application of organoids
has contributed to unprecedented advances in research
on human development and diseases. Even though
current organoid systems show some limitations and re-
quire further optimization for use in disease modeling
and personalized medicine, they will continue to be valu-
able tools in basic and translational research.
