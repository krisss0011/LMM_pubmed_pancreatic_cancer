Background:The most appropriate venous reconstruction method remains debatable when a long section of portal vein (PV) and/or superior mesenteric vein (SMV) must be resected in patients undergoing a pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). The aim of the present study was to describe the technical details of the parachute technique, a modified end-to-end anastomotic maneuver that can be used in the above-mentioned circumstances, and to investigate its safety and feasibility.Study design:Patients who underwent venous reconstruction using the parachute technique after receiving a PD with PV resection for pancreatic cancer between January 2014 and March 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. For the parachute technique, the posterior wall was sutured in a continuous fashion while the stitches were left untightened. The stitches were then tightened from both sides after the running suture of the posterior wall had been completed, thereby dispersing the tension applied to the stitched venous wall when the venous ends were brought together and solving any problems that would otherwise have been caused by over-tension. The postoperative outcomes and PV patency were then investigated.Results:Fifteen patients were identified. The median length of the resected PV/SMV measured in vivo was 5 cm (range, 3-6 cm). The splenic vein was resected in all the patients and was reconstructed in 13 patients (87%). The overall postoperative complication rate (≥ Clavien-Dindo grade I) was 60%, while a major complication (≥ Clavien-Dindo grade IIIa) occurred in 1 patient (7%). No postoperative deaths occurred in this series. The PV patency at 1 year was 87%.Conclusion:The parachute technique is both safe and feasible and is a simple venous reconstruction procedure suitable for use in cases undergoing PD when the distance between the resected PV and SMV is relatively long.
