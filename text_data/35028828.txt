Background:Poor prognosis and short survival of patients harboring pancreatic cancer emerge how advanced disease it is. In a trial to achieve the earliest and most accurate diagnosis to manage this progressive disease, we proposed that using endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) with an adjuvant diagnostic immunohistochemical marker would give better diagnostic results. IMP3 has gained recently wide attention, as many studies found that IMP3 has not only diagnostic but also prognostic role in different types of malignancies.Aim of the study:This prospective work is to assess the diagnostic role of EUS-FNA combined with the immunohistochemical expression of IMP3 on different benign and malignant pancreatic lesions.Material and method:The included pancreatic lesions (n = 140) were obtained by EUS-FNA technique and stained for IMP3 immunohistochemically. Paraffin blocks from patients who underwent excision (n = 92) or core biopsies (n = 48) were performed for confirming diagnosis.Results:The combined method for diagnosis showed that IMP3 was positive in 78.7%, 91.7%, 100% PAC, mucinous neoplasm with high grade dysplasia, and IPMN with high grade dysplasia, respectively, while almost all benign lesions showed negative IMP3. Also, this method showed sensitivity (78.26%), specificity (95.83%), and accuracy (84.3%).Conclusion:EUS-FNA cytology with IMP3 could be a reliable diagnostic tool especially for assessment of malignant pancreatic lesions.
