Pancreatic carcinoma incidence showed a significant increase in men over the last few years and the prognosis remains poor. Patients are treated with different pharmacological plans with no evidence about gender-specific adverse effects. We aimed to investigate differences in the incidence of chemotherapy side effects in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, to provide insights toward a personalized assistance based in individual needs. The sample population is composed of 207 patients. Regression model highlighted the predictive role of female gender for alopecia, constipation, hand-foot syndrome, and epigastric pain. Also, considering single therapeutic schemes, gender differences have been reported. Moreover, evaluating the effect of age, a general reduced risk of toxicity has been reported in younger patients. To personalize chemotherapy and increase patient survival rate and life quality during the therapy, gender medicine and pharmacology studies are recommended.
