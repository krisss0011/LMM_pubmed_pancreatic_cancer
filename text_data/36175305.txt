Background:Partner and localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2) is a pancreatic cancer (PC) susceptibility gene reported in Caucasians. However, limited data are available among Asians. We investigated the contribution of PALB2 germline variants to Pakistani PC patients.Methods:150 unselected and prospectively enrolled PC patients were comprehensively screened for PALB2 variants, using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and DNA sequencing. Novel variants were investigated for their pathogenic effect using in-silico tools. Potentially functional variants were screened in 200 controls.Results:Twenty-two different PALB2 variants were identified. A missense variant (p.Arg37His) was identified in a 48-years-old male patient with a family history of breast cancer. Another missense variant (p.Trp898Arg) was identified in a 48-years-old male patient with a family history of esophageal cancer. A novel 3' downstream variant (c.∗480A>G) was detected in a 34-years-old female patient with family history of lung cancer. Another novel 3' downstream variant (c.∗417A>C) was identified in a 41-years-old male patient. All these variants were absent in 200 controls. p.Arg37His and p.Trp898Arg were predicted as likely pathogenic. c.∗417A>C and c.∗480A>G were classified as variants of uncertain significance.Conclusion:This is the first study that suggests a minimal contribution of PALB2 variants to PC risk in Pakistani population.
