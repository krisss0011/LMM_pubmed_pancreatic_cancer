INTRODUCTION: The phase III REFLECT trial demonstrated that lenvatinib was 
superior to sorafenib in terms of progression-free survival (PFS), time to 
progression, and objective response rate (ORR) for patients with unresectable 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study assessed the efficacy and safety of 
preoperative lenvatinib therapy for patients with oncologically or technically 
unresectable HCC.
METHODS: In this multicenter single-arm phase II trial, patients with advanced 
HCC and factors suggestive of a poor prognosis (macroscopic vascular invasion, 
extrahepatic metastasis, or multinodular tumors) were enrolled. Patients with 
these factors, even with technically resectable HCC, were defined as 
oncologically unresectable because of the expected poor prognosis after surgery. 
After 8 weeks of lenvatinib therapy, the patients were assessed for 
resectability, and tumor resection was performed if the tumor was considered 
technically resectable. The primary endpoint was the surgical resection rate. 
The secondary endpoints were the macroscopic curative resection rate, overall 
survival (OS), ORR, PFS, and the change in the indocyanine green retention rate 
at 15 min as measured before and after lenvatinib therapy. The trial was 
registered with the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (s031190057).
RESULTS: Between July 2019 and January 2021, 49 patients (42 oncologically 
unresectable patients and 7 technically unresectable patients) from 11 centers 
were enrolled. The ORR was 37.5% based on mRECIST and 12.5% based on RECIST 
version 1.1. Thirty-three patients underwent surgery (surgical resection rate: 
67.3%) without perioperative mortality. The surgical resection rate was 76.2% 
for oncologically unresectable patients and 14.3% for technically unresectable 
patients. The 1-year OS rate and median PFS were 75.9% and 7.2 months, 
respectively, with a median follow-up period of 9.3 months.
CONCLUSIONS: The relatively high surgical resection rate seen in this study 
suggests the safety and feasibility of lenvatinib therapy followed by surgical 
resection for patients with oncologically or technically unresectable HCC.
