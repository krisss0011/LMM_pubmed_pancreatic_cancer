A 55-year-old woman with endogenous hyperinsulinemia hypoglycemia was clinically diagnosed with insulinoma. Contrast-enhanced MRI revealed an inconclusive hypointense lesion in the pancreatic tail, and the enhancement pattern does not support the diagnosis of insulinoma. 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT showed intense radioactivity in this nodule, similar to the radioactivity of the adjacent spleen. Therefore, the diagnosis of accessory spleen cannot be excluded. Follow-up with 68Ga-exendin-4 PET/CT also showed intense uptake in this nodule, but no significant uptake in the spleen was observed at this time. Therefore, the insulinoma was unmasked from the spleen, excluding the diagnosis of accessory spleen, and allowing curative surgery.
