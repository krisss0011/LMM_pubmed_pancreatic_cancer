Aim:To compare the overall survival (OS) among patients who received first-line modified gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel (G/nab-P) or 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan and oxaliplatin (mFOLFIRINOX) for metastatic pancreatic cancer.Methods:A single-center, retrospective, real-world study was conducted.Results:The median OS was 9.4 months versus 7.5 months in the mFOLFIRINOX and modified G/Nab-P groups, respectively (p = 0.16). An exploratory subgroup analysis excluding patients who received one infusion and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 2 demonstrated similar OS of 11.3 months and 8.9 months, respectively. Median progression-free survival and time-to-treatment failure were not significantly different. Higher rates of adverse events were noted with mFOLFIRINOX.Conclusion:mFOLFIRINOX did not significantly prolong OS compared with modified G/nab-P and was associated with increased toxicities.
