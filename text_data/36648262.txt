Background:Distress screening of cancer patients is mandated by the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer. Clinical implementation remains limited, particularly in surgical oncology settings in individuals with pancreaticobiliary cancers.Study design:This study evaluated differences in mean distress scores based on the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Thermometer & Problem List for patients with pancreaticobiliary cancers, benign pancreatic conditions, and for their significant others (SOs). The distress screening was conducted at the first office visit and postoperatively in a subset of those who had surgery. Distress Thermometer (DT) scores were dichotomized at ≤5 vs >5 and at ≥7 and correlated with Problem List items. The US ZIP Code database was used to correlate income range, percent poverty, and unemployment in the patient's self-identified ZIP code. Regression models were fitted to identify independent predictors of distress.Results:A total of 547 patients and 184 SOs were evaluated. Thirty percent of patients had DT scores >5, with pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients reporting the highest levels of distress. SOs of pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients reported even greater distress than the patients themselves. As the number of pre-existing medical problems increased; so did DT scores. Distress correlated with physical and emotional problems and worry about insurance coverage and transportation. Higher income level predicted higher DT scores, although poverty predicted lower DT scores. Depression was present in 12% of the patients. Distress improved in those undergoing surgery.Conclusions:Distress and depression in pancreaticobiliary cancer patients and SOs are prevalent. The findings of this study have multiple actionable implications and require diagnosis, treatment, and referral to supportive care resources.
