Background:NEDD8 (neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated protein 8) is one of the ubiquitin-like proteins which is activated by the NEDD8 activating enzyme (NAE). The overexpressed NAE can cause a variety of diseases such as numerous cancer types and inflammatory diseases. The selective inhibition of NAE could mediate the rate of ubiquitination and the subsequent degradation of proteins associated with cancer so as to achieve the purpose of treatment.Objective:In this article, we decided to study the synthesis and screening of coumarin scaffold derivatives against cancer cell lines, specifically the human pancreatic cancer cell line BxPC-3.Methods:Twenty-four targeted compounds were synthesized, and their anti-proliferative activity against three cancer cell lines, cytotoxicity against three normal cell lines through CCK-8 and MTT assay were evaluated to screen out the candidate compound. Then the target was further confirmed by both enzyme and cell-based experiments, as well as cell apoptosis research.Results:Several new 4-position substituted coumarin derivatives (12a~x) were synthesized and most of them exhibit antiproliferative activity in three cancer cell lines. A series of experiments were performed to identify the best candidate compound 12v. This compound displayed the highest potency against BxPC-3 with an IC50 value of 0.28 Î¼M. It can also inhibit NAE activity in enzyme and cellbased assay, and induce CRLs-mediated accumulation of the substrate and apoptosis in BxPC-3 cells. Meanwhile, it exhibited relatively low toxicity in three normal cells.Conclusion:Based on these results, we found that compound 12v inhibited NAE activity in enzyme and cell-based systems and induced apoptosis in BxPC-3 cells. Additionally, it also had a low toxicity. These results suggested that 12v may be promising lead compounds for the development of new anticancer drugs.
