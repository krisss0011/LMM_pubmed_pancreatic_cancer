Background:/Objective: As a new immune-nutritional marker, the controlled nutritional status (CONUT) score has been reported to predict the prognosis of cancer patients. We aimed to elucidate the prognostic value of preoperative CONUT score in pancreatic cancer patients undergoing radical surgery, and to construct a nomogram based on CONUT score to predict individual survival.Methods:Preoperative CONUT scores were calculated prospectively in 382 patients with pancreatic cancer who underwent radical surgery. Evaluated the relationship between CONUT score and pancreatic cancer prognosis. Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine predictors of survival and a new nomogram was established to predict pancreatic cancer overall survival (OS).Results:The area under curve of CONUT score was higher than other immune-nutritional indexes. The OS of the high-CONUT group were significantly lower than that of low-CONUT group. Multivariate analysis showed that CONUT score, gender, AJCC stage, complications and reoperation were independent prognostic factors for OS. Nomogram based on these variables has better discriminant ability in predicting survival compared with other traditional staging systems.Conclusions:Preoperative CONUT score is an effective independent predictor of OS in pancreatic cancer patients undergoing radical surgery. This new CONUT based nomogram provides accurate, individualized survival prediction for pancreatic cancer.
