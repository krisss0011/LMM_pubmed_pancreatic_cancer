Pancreatic cancer is a common gastrointestinal tumor with increasing morbidity and mortality, and it is difficult to differentiate it from chronic mass pancreatitis. F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (F-FDG PET/CT) can be used for diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, staging, radiotherapy planning, evaluation of efficacy and recurrence, and differentiation from posttreatment fibrosis but the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis are poor. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) not only shows the morphology, location, and size of organs and lesions but also has the advantages of low radiation, high soft tissue contrast, and multiparameter imaging, which can help determine the nature of occupying pancreatic lesions. In this study, the watershed algorithm (WA) was used to segment the abdominal images to extract images of pancreatic cancer cells and to compare the value of F-FDG PET/CT combined with MRI in the diagnosis of pancreatic occupying lesions.
