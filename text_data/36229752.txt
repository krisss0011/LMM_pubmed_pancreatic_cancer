The multi-drug combination regime, FOLFIRINOX, is a standard of care chemotherapeutic therapy for pancreatic cancer patients. However, systematic evaluation of potential pharmacodynamic interactions among multi-drug therapy has not been reported previously. Here, pharmacodynamic interactions of the FOLFIRINOX agents (5-fluorouracil (5-FU), oxaliplatin (Oxa) and SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan) were assessed across a panel of primary and established pancreatic cancer cells. Inhibition of cell proliferation was quantified for each drug, alone and in combination, to obtain quantitative, drug-specific interaction parameters and assess the nature of drug interactions. The experimental data were analysed assuming Bliss independent interactions, and nonlinear regression model fitting was conducted in SAS. Estimates of the drug interaction term, psi (ψ), revealed that the Oxa/SN-38 combination appeared synergistic in PANC-1 (ψ = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.4, 0.9) and modestly synergistic, close to additive, in MIAPaCa-2 (ψ = 0.8, 95% CI = 0.6, 1.0) in 2D assays. The triple combination was strongly synergistic in MIAPaCa-2 (ψ = 0.2, 95% CI = 0.1, 0.3) and modestly synergistic/borderline additive in PANC-1 2D (ψ = 0.8, 95% CI = 0.6, 1.0). The triple combination showed antagonistic interactions in the primary PIN-127 and 3D PANC-1 model (ψ > 1). Quantitative pharmacodynamic interactions have not been described for the FOLFIRINOX regimen; this analysis suggests a complex interplay among the three chemotherapeutic agents. Extension of this pharmacodynamic analysis approach to clinical/translational studies of the FOLFIRINOX combination could reveal additional pharmacodynamic interactions and guide further refinement of this regimen to achieve optimal clinical responses.
