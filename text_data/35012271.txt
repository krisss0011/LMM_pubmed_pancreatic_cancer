Objective:To compare and analyze the clinical efficacy of pancreaticoduodenectomy for distal bile duct cancer and pancreatic head cancer.Methods:Clinical data of 1 005 patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy and postoperative pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of distal bile duct cancer and pancreatic head cancer at the Pancreas Center of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University from January 2016 to December 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. There were 112 cases in the distal bile duct cancer group, 71 males and 41 females,with age (M(IQR)) of 65(15) years(range: 40 to 87 years); 893 cases in the pancreatic head cancer group, 534 males and 359 females,with age of 64(13)years(range: 16 to 91 years). The differences between clinicopathological characteristics and postoperative overall survival of the two groups were analyzed by χ2test, Fisher's exact probability method, rank sum test or log-rank test, respectively. The difference in postoperative overall survival between the two groups was compared using Kaplan-Meier method after propensity score matching (1∶1).Results:Compared with the pancreatic head cancer group,the distal bile duct cancer group had shorter operative time (240.0(134.0) minutesvs.261.0(97.0) minutes,Z=2.712,P=0.007),less proportion of combined venous resection (4.5% (5/112)vs.19.4% (173/893), χ²=15.177,P<0.01),smaller tumor diameter (2.0(1.0) cmvs.3.0(1.5) cm,Z=10.567,P<0.01),higher well/moderate differentiation ratio (51.4% (56/112)vs.38.0% (337/893), χ²=7.328,P=0.007),fewer positive lymph nodes (0(1)vs. 1(3),Z=5.824,P<0.01),and higher R0 resection rate (77.7% (87/112)vs.38.3%(342/893), χ²=64.399,P<0.01),but with a higher incidence of overall postoperative complications (50.0% (56/112)vs.36.3% (324/892), χ²=7.913,P=0.005),postoperative pancreatic fistula (28.6% (32/112)vs.13.9% (124/893), χ²=16.318,P<0.01),and postoperative abdominal infection (21.4% (24/112)vs.8.6% (77/892), χ²=18.001,P<0.01). After propensity score matching, there was no statistical difference in postoperative overall survival time between patients in the distal bile duct cancer group and the pancreatic head cancer group (50.6 monthsvs.35.1 months,Z=1.640,P=0.201),and multifactorial analysis showed that tumor site was not an independent risk factor affecting the prognosis of patients in both groups after matching (HR=0.73,95%CI:0.43 to 1.23,P=0.238).Conclusions:Patients with distal bile duct cancer are more likely to benefit from early diagnosis and surgical treatment than patients with pancreatic head cancer,but with a relative higher postoperative complication rates. The different tumor origin site is not an independent risk factor for prognosis of patients with distal bile duct cancer and pancreatic head cancer after propensity score matching.
