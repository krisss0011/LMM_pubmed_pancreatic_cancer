Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the most common histological subtype of pancreatic cancer, is an aggressive disease predicted to be the 2nd cause of cancer mortality in the US by 2040. While first-line therapy has improved, 5-year overall survival has only increased from 5 to ∼10%, and surgical resection is only available for ∼20% of patients as most present with advanced disease, which is invariably lethal. PDAC has well-established highly recurrent mutations in four driver genes including KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A, and SMAD4. Unfortunately, these genetic drivers are not currently therapeutically actionable. Despite extensive sequencing efforts, few additional significantly recurrent and druggable drivers have been identified. In the absence of targetable mutations, chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment for most patients. Further, the role of the above driver mutations on PDAC initiation and early development is well-established. However, these mutations alone cannot account for PDAC heterogeneity nor discern early from advanced disease. Taken together, management of PDAC is an example highlighting the shortcomings of the current precision medicine paradigm. PDAC, like other malignancies, represents an ecoevolutionary process. Better understanding the disease through this lens can facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies to better control and cure PDAC. This review aims to integrate the current understanding of PDAC pathobiology into an ecoevolutionary framework.
