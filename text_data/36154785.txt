Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a poor prognosis, with a mere âˆ¼10% of patients in the United States surviving 5 years from the time of diagnosis. Until recently, the treatment for advanced PDAC differed little based on patient or tumor characteristics. However, recent breakthroughs have identified subgroups of patients who benefit from novel, biomarker-driven therapies. We review the data and role for PARP inhibitors and for other biomarker-directed therapies, including for patients with NTRK fusions, NRG1 fusions, mismatch repair deficiency, and KRAS p.G12C mutations.
