Objectives:Guidelines for testing individuals at risk (IAR) for developing pancreatic duct adenocarcinoma (PC) are being advanced from university hospital populations. We implemented a screen-in criteria and protocol for IAR for PC in our community hospital setting.Methods:Eligibility was based on germline status and/or family history of PC. Longitudinal testing continued, alternating between endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The primary objective was to analyze pancreatic conditions and their associations with risk factors. The secondary objective was to evaluate the outcomes and complications resulting from testing.Results:Over 93 months, 102 individuals completed baseline EUS, and 26 (25%) met defined endpoints of any abnormal findings in the pancreas. Average enrollment was 40 months, and all participants with endpoints continued standard surveillance. Two participants (1.8%) had endpoint findings requiring surgery for premalignant lesions. Increasing age predicted for endpoint findings. Analysis of longitudinal testing suggested reliability between the EUS and MRI results.Conclusions:In our community hospital population, baseline EUS was effective in identifying the majority of findings; advancing age correlated with a greater chance of abnormalities. No differences were observed between EUS and MRI findings. Screening programs for PC among IAR can be successfully performed in the community setting.
