Human peroxiredoxin (PRX) family of antioxidant enzymes reduces hydrogen peroxide and alkyl hydroperoxide involved in the redox signaling, among which the widely documented PRX1 is a versatile molecule regulating cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis, and has been implicated in the tumorigensis of pancreatic cancer. In this study, we systematically examined the complex crystal structure of PRX1 with its cognate interacting partner sulfiredoxin-1 (SRX1) at molecular level, and found that the PRX1-SRX1 association is a typical peptide-mediated protein-protein interaction, where a 18-mer C-terminal tail (CTT) segment of PRX1 was identified to be primarily responsible for the interaction, which contributes ~80% and ~ 55% to the total binding potency of SRX1 to PRX1 monomer and homodimer, respectively. We also demonstrated that the SRX1 exhibits a strong global selectivity for PRX1 CTT tail over other PRX family proteins. Next, the intermolecular interaction between PRX1 CTT tail and SRX1 was investigated at structural, energetic and dynamic levels, from which a 9-mer core region of PRX1 CTT tail was defined as the SRX1-binding hotspot. Biophysical assays substantiated that the CTT and CTTc peptides (out of PRX1 protein context) can bind in an independent manner and possess a close affinity to SRX1. Based on the CTTc sketch a computational combinatorial library consisting of 216 designed peptide derivatives was rationally generated, from which the top-5 hits were found to have comparable affinity with CTT peptide and improved affinity relative to CTTc peptide. They can be used as structurally reduced lead molecular entities to further develop new peptidic agents for therapeutic purpose to disrupt the native PRX1-SRX1 interaction by competing with PRX1 CTT tail for the peptide-binding pocket of SRX1.
