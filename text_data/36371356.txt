Background:Peritoneal lavage cytology for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is conducted with both an intraoperative rapid diagnosis by Papanicolaou staining (cytology-rapid) and a final diagnosis by immunocytochemical staining at a later date (cytology-final) in our hospital. However, the clinical significance of cytology-final has not yet been elucidated.Methods:A total of 675 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients who underwent pancreatectomy and cytology between 2002 and 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Diagnostic results of cytology-rapid and cytology-final and survival outcomes were analyzed.Results:A total of 43 patients (6.4%) were diagnosed as cytology-rapid (+), and all of them were ultimately diagnosed as cytology-final (+). Among the 632 patients with cytology-rapid (-), 19 (3.0%) were eventually diagnosed as cytology-final (+). The overall survival of patients with cytology-rapid (+) and that of patients with cytology-rapid (-) did not differ to a statistically significant extent (median survival time 26.4 vs 32.9 months; P = .106). In contrast, the overall survival of patients who were diagnosed as a false-negative result by cytology-rapid was significantly worse than that of patients diagnosed as a true negative (18.7 vs 34.8 months; P = .031). The overall survival of patients with cytology-final (+) was significantly worse than that of patients with cytology-final (-) (23.6 vs 34.8 months; P = .012). A multivariate analysis showed that cytology-final (+) was an independent prognostic factor for the OS (hazard ratio = 1.43; P = .049), whereas cytology-rapid (+) was not.Conclusion:Immunocytochemical staining may be a useful complement to a diagnosis of cytology by conventional Papanicolaou staining in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients.
