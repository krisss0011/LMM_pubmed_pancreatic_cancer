Polymer dots (Pdots) have become attractive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) luminophores due to their facile synthesis, easy modification, and stable electrochemical and optical properties. However, their ECL efficiency is not high enough for practical applications. In this work, we proposed an ECL immunosensor based on localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) between AuNPs and Pdots for the determination of pancreatic cancer exosomes. Based on the finite-difference time-domain simulations and the band energy of Pdots and AuNPs, we proposed the possible LSPR mechanism. The hot electrons of plasmonic AuNPs were photoexcited to surface plasmon states by ECL emission of Pdots, and then the excited hot electrons were transferred to the conduction band of Pdots, which significantly improved the ECL efficiency of Pdots. The ECL immunosensor displayed a wide calibration range of 1.0 × 103to 1.0 × 106particles/mL with a detection limit of 400 particles/mL. Cancer-related protein profiling revealed high selectivity toward different expressions of exosomal surface proteins from PANC-01, HeLa, MCF-7, and HPDE6-C7 cell lines. The proposed ECL system exhibits a promising prospect for protein biomarker profiling and early cancer-related diagnosis.
