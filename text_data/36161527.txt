Background:Early detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) may improve the prognosis of patients. This study was to identify metabolic features of PDAC and to discover early detection biomarkers for PDAC by tissue and serum metabolomics analysis.Methods:We conducted nontargeted metabolomics analysis in tissue samples of 51 PDAC tumors, 40 noncancerous pancreatic tissues (NT), and 14 benign pancreatic neoplasms (BP) as well as serum samples from 80 patients with PDAC, 36 with BP, and 48 healthy controls (Ctr). The candidate metabolites identified from the initial analysis were further quantified using targeted analysis in serum samples of an independent cohort of 22 early stage PDAC, 27 BP, and 27 Ctr subjects. Unconditional binary logistic regression analysis was used to construct the optimal model for PDAC diagnosis.Results:Upregulated levels of fatty acids and lipids and downregulated amino acids were observed in tissue and serum samples of PDAC patients. Proline, creatine, and palmitic acid were identified as a panel of potential biomarkers to distinguish PDAC from BP and Ctr (odds ratio = 2.17, [95% confidence interval 1.34-3.53]). The three markers showed area under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of 0.854 and 0.865, respectively, for the comparison of PDAC versus Ctr and PDAC versus BP. The AUCs were 0.830 and 0.852 in the validation set and were improved to 0.949 and 0.909 when serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) was added to the model.Conclusion:The novel metabolite biomarker panel identified in this study exhibited promising performance in distinguishing PDAC from BP or Ctr, especially in combination with CA19-9.
