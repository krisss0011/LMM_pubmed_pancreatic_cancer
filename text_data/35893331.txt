Patient- and family-centered care (PFCC) has become more important due to advances in medical treatment and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The evidence in the literature has proven the ability of PFCC to accomplish win-win results for the three principal parties (patients, family, and healthcare providers). In Taiwan, pancreatic cancer has risen to the 7th largest cause of cancer mortality, with increasing numbers of pancreatic-cancer-related deaths over the past ten years. Pancreatic cancer is difficult to diagnose early, and diagnoses are nearly always made during the late stage, resulting in high levels of physical and psychological distress for patients. This article was developed to introduce the core concept of PFCC and its evidence in the context of adult patients with cancer. Furthermore, the rehabilitation care model, based on PFCC, includes the 6 aspects of Family involvement, Optimistic attitude, Coping effectiveness, Uncertainty reduction, Symptom management, and Physical enhancement (FOCUS+P). A PFCC-based example of pancreatic cancer care is proposed that may be expanded to the care of patients with other types of cancer to improve the quality of life of patients and their families.
