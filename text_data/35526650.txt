Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by a highly desmoplastic tumor microenvironment (TME) consisting of abundant activated pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs). PSCs play a key role in the refractory responses of PDAC to immunotherapy and chemotherapy and deactivating PSCs into quiescence through vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling activation is a promising strategy for PDAC treatment. We observed p62 loss in PSCs hindered the deactivation efficacy of VDR ligands, and hypothesized that reversing p62 levels by inhibiting autophagy processing, which is responsible for p62 loss, could sensitize PSCs toward VDR ligands. Herein, we constructed a PSC deactivator with dual functions of VDR activation and autophagy inhibition, utilizing a pH-buffering micelle (LBM) with an inherent ability to block autophagic flux to encapsulate calcipotriol (Cal), a VDR ligand. This Cal-loaded LBM (C-LBM) could efficiently reprogram PSCs, modulate the fibrotic TME, and alter immunosuppression. In combination with PD-1 antagonists and chemotherapy, C-LBM showed superior antitumor efficacy and significantly prolonged the survival of PDAC mice. These findings suggest that synergistic autophagy blockade and VDR signaling activation are promising therapeutic approaches to reprogram PSCs and improve the PDAC response to immunotherapy.
