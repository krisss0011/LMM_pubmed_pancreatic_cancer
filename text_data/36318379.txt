Background/aims:Diabetes secondary to endocrine insufficiency in chronic pancreatitis (CP) may develop at any time during the disease course. We sought to evaluate the differences in clinical characteristics and outcomes in CP patients with pre-existing, early-onset, and late-onset diabetes.Methods:We reviewed CP patients seen at our Pancreas Center during 2016-2021. We divided them into four groups: those without diabetes, with pre-existing diabetes, with early-onset diabetes, and with late-onset diabetes. We then compared clinical characteristics and outcomes.Results:We identified 450 patients with CP: 271 without diabetes, 99 with pre-existing diabetes, 51 with early-onset diabetes, and 29 with late-onset diabetes. Early-onset diabetics were younger (54.1 vs 57.3 vs 62.5 vs 61.9 years), had more alcohol-related CP (45.1% vs 31.7% vs 32.3% vs 31%), had higher HbA1C levels (8.02% vs 5.11% vs 7.71% vs 7.66%), were more likely to be on insulin (78.4% vs 0% vs 48.4% vs 65.5%), and used more opioids (64.7% vs 43.9% vs 55.1% vs 44.8%) and gabapentinoids (66.7% vs 43.5% vs 48% vs 60.7%) compared to other groups (p < 0.05). Patients who developed diabetes after CP diagnosis had more exocrine insufficiency (72.4% vs 70.6% vs 65.7% vs 53.1%), anatomical complications, and interventions for pain control (p < 0.05). There was no difference in pancreatic cancer in the four groups.Conclusion:CP patients who are younger and use alcohol are at higher risk of having early-onset diabetes and have poorer glucose control compared other CP patients. Patients who develop diabetes after CP diagnosis have worse outcomes and use more resources.
