The aim of this study was to determine possible anticancer effect of tomentosin, a natural sesquiterpene lactone, on pancreatic cancer cells. The cytotoxic effect of tomentosin was determined by XTT analysis. Colony formation and apoptosis analyzes were performed, Reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and change in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were evaluated in control and tomentosin-treated cells. The effect of tomentosin on expression levels of apoptosis-related genes was determined by qRT-PCR and Caspase-3 and Caspase-9 proteins were analyzed by western blot. And, the effect of tomentosin on migration and invasion of cells were evaluated. The IC50dose of tomentosin was found to be 31.11 μM in PANC-1 cells and 33.93 μM in MIA PaCa-2 cells for 48 h. And, treatment of tomentosin at IC50dose suppressed the colony forming capacity of cells. While tomentosin increased apoptosis rate and ROS production, an decrease was observed in MMP. Tomentosin affected expression level of apoptosis-related genes and increased Caspase-3 and Caspase-9 protein levels. After tomentosin treatment, cell migration and invasion were suppressed. As a result, this study reveals that tomentosin has anticancer effects on pancreatic cancer cells, and therefore it predicts that tomentosin can be evaluated as an effective agent against pancreatic cancer.
