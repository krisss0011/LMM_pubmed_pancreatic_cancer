Adjuvant systemic chemotherapy with gemcitabine (GEM) is recognized as the standard of care to improve the prognosis of patients with resected pancreatic cancer (PC); however, it is greatly limited by poor absorption of chemotherapy agents. Moreover, surgical site infection and Gammaproteobacteria-induced GEM resistance further decrease the chemotherapy efficacy and increase the risk of recurrence and even mortality. Here, we develop an implantable anti-bacterial and anti-cancer fibrous membrane (AAFM) to inhibit PC recurrence in a well-coordinated manner. Our AAFM can be readily prepared via simple co-electrospinning of GEM and poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) and subsequent tannic acid (TA)-mediated in-situ generation of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The resultant membrane presents highly porous fibrous morphology and appropriate mechanical performance. Most importantly, we find the surface-deposited TA/AgNP complexes can exert multiple therapeutic effects: (1) they can act as a fence to extend GEM diffusion route, achieving a sustained drug release; (2) they can fight the pathogenic microorganisms in the local microenvironment and prevent infectious complications and alleviate Gammaproteobacteria-induced chemotherapy resistance; (3) they can combat residual cancer cells to synchronously strengthen the effectiveness of GEM-based chemotherapy. Altogether, our AAFM provides a proof-of-concept demonstration of the integrated anti-cancer and anti-bacterial strategy for enhanced therapeutic efficacy and will inspire the design of other high-performance implants for prevention of tumor relapse.
