Objectives:To determine the sensitivity of ultrasound (US) in detecting pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in our region, to identify factors associated with US test result, and assess the impact on the diagnostic interval and survival.Methods:Patients diagnosed between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2015 in Nova Scotia, Canada were identified by a cancer registry. US performed prior to diagnosis were retrospectively graded as true positive (TP), indeterminate or false negative (FN). Amongst US results, differences in age, weight and tumor size were assessed [one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)]. Associations between result and sex, tumor location (proximal/distal), clinical suspicion of malignancy, and visualization of the pancreas, tumor, secondary signs and liver metastases were assessed (Chi-square). Mean follow-up imaging, diagnostic, and survival intervals were assessed (one-way ANOVA).Results:One hundred thirteen US of 107 patients (54 women; mean 70 Â± 13 years) were graded as follows: 48/113 (42.5%) TPs; 42/113 (37.2%) indeterminates; and 23/113 (20.4%) FNs. Sensitivity was 48/71(67.6%). There was no difference in age, weight or tumor size amongst US result (P > 0.5). FNs had proportionally more men (P = 0.011) and lacked clinical suspicion of malignancy (P = 0.0006); TPs had proportionally more proximal tumors (P = 0.017). US result was associated with visualization of the pancreas, tumor, secondary signs and liver metastases (P < 0.005). FNs had longer mean follow-up imaging (P < 0.0001) and diagnostic (P = 0.0007) intervals, and worse mean survival (P = 0.034).Conclusions:In our region, the sensitivity of US in detecting pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is 67.6%. A false negative US is associated with delayed diagnostic work-up and worse mean survival.
