Hereditary pancreatic cancers are caused by several inherited genes. Familial pancreatic cancer is defined as pancreatic cancer arising in a patient with at least two first-degree relatives with pancreatic cancer in the absence of an identified genetic cause. Hereditary pancreatic cancer syndromes and familial pancreatic cancers account for about 10% of pancreatic cancer cases. Germline mutations inBRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PALB2, CDKN2A, STK11,andTP53and mismatch repair genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2,andEPCAM) are among the well-known inherited susceptibility genes. Currently available targeted medications include poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARP) for cases with mutantBRCAand immune checkpoint inhibitors for cases with mismatch repair deficiency. Loss of heterozygosity of hereditary pancreatic cancer susceptibility genes such asBRCA1/2plays a key role in carcinogenesis and sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. Signature 3 identified by whole genome sequencing is also associated with homologous recombination deficiency and sensitivity to targeted therapies. In this review, we summarize molecular features and treatments of hereditary pancreatic cancer syndromes and surveillance procedures for unaffected high-risk cases. We also review transgenic murine models to gain a better understanding of carcinogenesis in hereditary pancreatic cancer.
