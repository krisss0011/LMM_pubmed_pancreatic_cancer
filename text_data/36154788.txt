Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal cancers in the world; it is a silent disease in which symptoms do not present until advanced stages, thereby reducing the 5-year survival rate to 10%. The global burden of pancreatic cancer has doubled over the past 25 years despite advancements in medicine. This review aims to discuss the global trends and disparities in pancreatic cancer, as well as the up-to-date literature on the known risk factors. A better understanding of these risk factors will reduce mortality by providing opportunities to screen these patients as well as counseling on lifestyle modifications.
