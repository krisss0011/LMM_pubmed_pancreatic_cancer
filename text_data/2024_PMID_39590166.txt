Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors like PD-1, PD-L1, and 
CTLA-4, has revolutionized cancer treatment. However, the role of the innate 
immune system, especially pattern recognition receptors, in cancer development 
and immunity is gaining more and more attention. Dectin-1, a C-type lectin 
receptor primarily involved in antifungal immunity, has emerged as a significant 
player in cancer biology, exhibiting both pro-tumor and anti-tumor roles. This 
dual function largely depends on the tumor type and microenvironment. Dectin-1 
can promote immune responses against tumors like melanoma and breast cancer by 
enhancing both innate and adaptive immunity. However, in tumors like pancreatic 
ductal adenocarcinoma and colorectal cancer, Dectin-1 activation suppresses T 
cell immunity, facilitating tumor progression. This review explores the complex 
mechanisms by which Dectin-1 modulates the tumor microenvironment and discusses 
its potential as a therapeutic target for cancer treatment.
