Objectives:Despite many studies suggesting an association between serum immunoglobulin G4 (sIgG4) and autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP), the evidence of utility in differentiation between AIP and pancreatic cancer (PC) remain uncertain.Methods:The analysis based on published studies. Data were pooled by means of a random-effects model, and sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratios (DOR), areas under summary receiver operating characteristic curves were calculated.Results:In the included thirteen studies, sIgG4 were measured in 594 patients with AIP and 958 patients with PC. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, DOR, and area under the curve were 0.72 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.68-0.75], 0.93 (95% CI: 0.92-0.95), 51.37 (95% CI: 23.20-113.74), and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.87-0.95). Subgroup analyses of the DORs for region and year: Asia, (112.10; 95% CI: 27.72-453.32), non-Asia (26.01; 95% CI: 12.38-54.65), and year before 2011 (107.61; 95% CI: 39.30-294.68), year after 2011 (26.96; 95% CI: 9.78-74.32). Overall, sIgG4 was associated with AIP, the result revealed a moderate sensitivity 0.72 and high specificity 0.93. In the meta-analysis, the pooled DOR of sIgG4 levels of 2-fold upper limit 50.44 was similar with the DOR 51.37 when 1-fold cut-off value, but the summary receiver operating characteristic was 0.755 and 0.91. The higher specificity (from 93% to 98%) derived from the cut-off value (from 130-140 to 260-280 mg/dL) for sIgG4 occurred at a significant reduction in sensitivity (from 72% to 43%).Conclusions:The study revealed sIgG4 is a good marker of AIP. Screening of sIgG4 may help clinicians differentiate between AIP and PC, and the best cut-off value should be 140 rather than 280 mg/dL.
