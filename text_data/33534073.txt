Background:Both plastic stents and self-expandable metallic stents (SEMSes) are used for endoscopic biliary decompression (BD) among patients with pancreatic cancer (PAC). Cholangitis or stent occlusion often interrupts or ends chemotherapy. We investigated cholangitis, stent occlusion, and chemotherapy interruption rates for SEMSes and plastic stents among patients receiving chemotherapy for PAC.Materials and methods:We retrospectively analyzed data for 293 PAC patients who received a biliary stent at Helsinki University Hospital during 2000-2017. Patients received chemotherapy as palliative treatment (PT: n = 187) or neoadjuvant treatment (NAT: n = 106). Among participants, 229 had a plastic stent (PT: n = 138, NAT: n = 91) and 64 had a SEMS (PT: n = 49, NAT: n = 15).Results:Overall, 15.6% (n = 10) of patients with SEMSes (PT: 20.4%, n = 10, NAT: 0%) and 53.0% (n = 121) of patients with plastic stents (PT: 69.3%, n = 95, NAT: 28.5%, n = 26) experienced one or more stent complications (p < 0.001). Cholangitis developed in 6.3% (n = 8) of PT patients with SEMSes. No patients with SEMSes receiving NAT (n = 15) experienced cholangitis. However, 31.9% (PT: 42.8%, n = 59, p = 0.001; NAT: 15.4%, n = 14, p = 0.211) of patients with plastic stents developed cholangitis. Among all patients receiving NAT or PT, cholangitis interrupted chemotherapy 6 times (9.4%) in SEMS patients and 61 times (26.6%) in plastic stent patients (p = 0.004). Stent occlusion without cholangitis interrupted NAT or PT 2 times (2.1%) in SEMS patients and 31 times (13.5%) in plastic stent patients (p = 0.023).Conclusions:SEMS is recommended for BD among patients with PAC receiving chemotherapy. Among both PT and NAT patients, patients with SEMS experience a lower stent failure rate, lower rate of cholangitis, and fewer chemotherapy interruptions than patients with plastic stents.
