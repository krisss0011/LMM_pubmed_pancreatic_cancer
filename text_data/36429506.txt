Pancreatic cancer (PC) represents the third leading cause of cancer death in 2020. Despite the fact that, in 2018, the World Cancer Research Fund report concluded that there is still a lack of evidence on the role of foods or diets and risk for PC, a flourishing body of evidence has been published and needs to be analyzed. For this reason, we conducted an umbrella review on the association between different dietary patterns/food components and PC. Data sources PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Collaboration were searched. The Joanna Briggs Institute Umbrella Review Methodology was used. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO. A total of 23 articles were included, covering a wide range of dietary patterns/food components: healthy/prudent dietary patterns (n= 4), Mediterranean diets (MedDiet) (n =1), plant-based diets (n =2), the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) (n =2), western diets (n =2), and, lastly, unhealthy diets (n =2). Regarding dietary components, the following were assessed: total fruit (n =2), citrus fruit (n =1), total vegetables (n =2), cruciferous vegetables (n =1), red meat (n =6), processed meat (n =4), poultry (n =2), eggs (n =1), fish (n= 5), whole grain (n =2), potato (n =1), and nuts (n =2). The methodological quality of the included meta-analyses was generally low or critically low. Although the strength of evidence was generally weak, convincing or suggestive evidence was found for a healthy/prudent, plant-based diet, fruit and vegetables, and lower risk of PC, whereas a high intake of red meat was associated with a higher risk of PC at a convincing level of evidence. Further studies are needed to confirm the role of the other dietary patterns/food components and the risk of PC.
