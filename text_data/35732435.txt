Pancreatic cancer has the poorest prognosis among digestive cancers. During the 1990s, the 5-year survival rate of surgical patients with pancreatic cancer was 14% in Japan. However, survival rates have increased to 40% in the 2020s due to the refinement of surgical procedures and the introduction of perioperative chemotherapy. Several pivotal randomized controlled trials have played an indispensable role to establish each standard treatment strategy. Resectability of pancreatic cancer can be classified into resectable, borderline resectable, and unresectable based on the anatomic configuration, and multidisciplinary treatment strategies for each classification have been revised rapidly. Investigation of superior perioperative adjuvant treatments for resectable and borderline resectable pancreatic cancer and the establishment of optimal conversion surgery for unresectable pancreatic cancer are the progressive subjects.
