Background:Poor prognosis of digestive system cancers is mainly owing to lack of accurate and timely diagnosis. The exploration of novel tumor biomarkers from extracellular vesicle (EV) might be helpful to clinical diagnosis for digestive system cancers.Methods:Several public databases were first used for a preliminary screening of candidate genes. The RNA levels of these candidate genes were then detected in cancer cell lines and the patients serum-derived EVs by PCR Array or digital PCR, respectively.Results:We found that 4 EV-RNAs, ANLN, ITGA6, KRT18, and MMP9, had a lower level in gastrointestinal cancer patients than in benign gastrointestinal diseases patients and healthy controls, while 3 EV-RNAs, ANLN, ITGA6, and KRT18, had a lower level in pancreatic cancer patients than in benign pancreatic diseases patients or healthy individuals. And EV-RNA of MMP9 had a relatively higher level in advanced pancreatic cancer patients than in early-stage patients. Moreover, ROC analysis demonstrated that the determination of the above EV-RNAs could increase the ability of traditional tumor biomarkers to distinguish benign and malignant diseases.Conclusions:The serum-derived EV-RNAs of ANLN, ITGA6, KRT18, and MMP9 could be served as novel, non-invasive biomarkers for digestive system cancers.
