Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are RNA molecules involved in gene regulation at transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and epigenetic levels. LncRNAs participate in regulating apoptosis and autophagy in pancreatic cancer (PCa) and can promote and/or decrease the proliferation rate of tumor cells. The metastasis of PCa cells is tightly regulated by lncRNAs and they can affect the mechanism of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to modulate metastasis. The drug resistance of PCa cells, especially to gemcitabine, can be affected by lncRNAs. In addition, lncRNAs enriched in exosomes can be transferred among tumor cells to regulate their proliferation and metastasis. Antitumor compounds, such as curcumin and ginsenosides, can regulate lncRNA expression in PCa therapy. As we discuss here, the expression level of lncRNAs can be considered as both a diagnostic and prognostic tool in patients with PCa.
