Objective:To perform a scoping review of imaging-based machine-learning models to predict clinical outcomes and identify biomarkers in patients with PDAC.Summary of background data:Patients with PDAC could benefit from better selection for systemic and surgical therapy. Imaging-based machine-learning models may improve treatment selection.Methods:A scoping review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses-scoping review guidelines in the PubMed and Embase databases (inception-October 2020). The review protocol was prospectively registered (open science framework registration: m4cyx). Included were studies on imaging-based machine-learning models for predicting clinical outcomes and identifying biomarkers for PDAC. The primary outcome was model performance. An area under the curve (AUC) of ≥0.75, or a P-value of ≤0.05, was considered adequate model performance. Methodological study quality was assessed using the modified radiomics quality score.Results:After screening 1619 studies, 25 studies with 2305 patients fulfilled the eligibility criteria. All but 1 study was published in 2019 and 2020. Overall, 23/25 studies created models using radiomics features, 1 study quantified vascular invasion on computed tomography, and one used histopathological data. Nine models predicted clinical outcomes with AUC measures of 0.78-0.95, and C-indices of 0.65-0.76. Seventeen models identified biomarkers with AUC measures of 0.68-0.95. Adequate model performance was reported in 23/25 studies. The methodological quality of the included studies was suboptimal, with a median modified radiomics quality score score of 7/36.Conclusions:The use of imaging-based machine-learning models to predict clinical outcomes and identify biomarkers in patients with PDAC is increasingly rapidly. Although these models mostly have good performance scores, their methodological quality should be improved.
