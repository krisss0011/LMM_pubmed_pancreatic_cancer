With the progress of precision medicine treatment in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), individualized cancer-related examination and prediction is of great importance in this high malignant tumor, and antibody-dependent cell phagocytosis (ADCP) with changed pathways highly enrolled in the carcinogenesis of PDAC. High-throughput data of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma were downloaded and 160 differentially expressed ADCP-related genes (ARGs) were obtained. Secondly, GO and KEGG enrichment analyses show that ADCP is a pivotal biologic process in pancreatic carcinogenesis. Next, CALB2, NLGN2, NCAPG and SERTAD2 are identified through multivariate Cox regression. These 4 genes are confirmed with significant prognostic value in PDAC. Then, a risk score formula is constructed and tested in PDAC samples. Finally, the correlation between these 4 genes and M2 macrophage polarization was screened. Some pivotal differentially expressed ADCP-related genes and biologic processes, four pivotal subgroup was among identified in the protein-protein network, and hub genes was found in these sub group. Then, an ADCP-related formula was set: CALB2* 0.355526 + NLGN2* -0.86862 + NCAPG* 0.932348 + SERTAD2* 1.153568. Additionally, the significant correlation between M2 macrophage-infiltration and the expression of each genes in PDAC samples was identified. Finally, the somatic mutation landscape and sensitive chemotherapy drug between high risk group and low risk group was explored. This study provides a potential prognostic signature for predicting prognosis of PDAC patients and molecular insights of ADCP in PDAC, and the formula focusing on the prognosis of PDAC can be effective. These findings will contribute to the precision medicine of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma treatment.
