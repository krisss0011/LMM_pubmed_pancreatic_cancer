Sphingosine kinase (SK) is involved in the growth of cells, including cancer cells. However, which of its two isotypes-SK1 and SK2-is more favorable for cancer growth remains unclear. Although PF-543 strongly and selectively inhibits SK1, its anticancer effect is not high, and the underlying reason remains difficult to explain. We previously determined that the tail group of PF-543 is responsible for its low metabolic stability (MS). In this study, compounds containing aromatic or aliphatic tails in the triazole group were synthesized, and changes in the SK-inhibitory effect and anticancer activity of PF-543 were assessed using pancreatic cancer cells. The compounds with aliphatic tails showed high inhibitory effects on pancreatic cancer cells but slightly lower selectivity for SK1. A compound with an introduced aliphatic tail activated protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), showing an effect similar to that of FTY720. Molecular docking analysis revealed that the PP2A-binding form of this newly synthesized compound was different from that noted in the case of FTY720. This compound also improved the MS of PF-543. These results indicate that the tail structure of PF-543 influences MS.
