Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been the subject of multiple recent preclinical and clinical studies for its beneficial use in the combination treatments of different types of cancers. Polymeric HCQ (PCQ), a macromolecular multivalent version of HCQ, has been shown to be effective in various cancer models bothin vitroandin vivoas an inhibitor of cancer cell migration and experimental lung metastasis. Here, we present detailedin vitrostudies that show that low concentrations of PCQ can efficiently inhibit cancer cell migration and colony formation orders of magnitude more effectively compared to HCQ. After intraperitoneal administration of PCQin vivo, high levels of tumor accumulation and penetration are observed, combined with strong antimetastatic activity in an orthotopic pancreatic cancer model. These studies support the idea that PCQ may be effectively used at low doses as an adjuvant in the therapy of pancreatic cancer. In conjunction with previously published literature, these studies further undergird the potential of PCQ as an anticancer agent.
