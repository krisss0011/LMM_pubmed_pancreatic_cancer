The most common type of pancreatic cancer is pancreatic adenocarcinoma, which affects the exocrine ducts. There are many risk factors associated with pancreatic cancer, including smoking, obesity, poor diet, diabetes, inactivity and genetics. In the UK, pancreatic cancer is the 10th most common cancer with a poor prognosis, with only 24% of people surviving the first year after diagnosis and 7% surviving for 5 years. The lives of those with the condition are impacted in a number of ways.
