The macroscopic and microscopic assessments of pancreatic cancer resection specimens belong to the standard repertoire of any department of pathology. In recent years standards have been developed regarding both macroscopic and microscopic assessments, which are laid down in international and national guidelines and classifications and are regularly updated. In this way the reporting of results and interdisciplinary communication are facilitated. These classifications and guidelines are influenced by current studies and the data from them provide information on which histopathological factors are particularly relevant for the prognosis and treatment. Due to the increasing use of neoadjuvant therapy the assessment of tumor regression in histopathological specimens is also gaining in importance. Finally, individual targeted treatments are also now available for pancreatic cancer, which require extended molecular pathological diagnostics.
