Background/aim:The regimen of nanoliposomal irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin (Nal-IRI/FL) was approved in Japan as second-line chemotherapy after gemcitabine-based treatment for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in 2020. We examined the difference in outcome between patients treated with second-line folinic acid, fluorouracil, irinotecan hydrochloride and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) and those treated with nal-IRI/FL after first-line gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (GnP).Patients and methods:The outcomes of 34 patients with PDAC who received second-line FOLFIRINOX (n=21) or nal-IRI/FL (n=13) after GnP at our Department from January 2016 to June 2021 were reviewed retrospectively.Results:Patient backgrounds did not differ between the groups. Dose reduction was more frequently required for treatment with FOLFIRINOX than with nal-IRI/FL (86% vs. 46%, p=0.022). Pegfilgrastim and aprepitant were used more frequently in the FOLFIRINOX group (both p<0.01). Progression-free survival (5.9 vs. 8.3 months) and overall survival (9.1 vs. 11.2 months) did not differ significantly between the groups. The frequency of grade 3 (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) or higher adverse events was similar between the groups. All-grade peripheral neuropathy was more common in the FOLFIRINOX group (100% vs. 77%, p=0.048).Conclusion:FOLFIRINOX and nal-IRI/FL as second-line therapy after GnP provided similar prognoses, although supportive treatment and dose reduction were more frequently required for FOLFIRINOX.
