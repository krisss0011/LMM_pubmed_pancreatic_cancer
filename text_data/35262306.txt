Chronic pancreatitis tends to develop a number of complications that may constitute the form of presentation of the disease. Some societies have issued guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of chronic pancreatitis complications, but the level of evidence for any topic is usually low and recommendations tend to be weak. We aimed to provide defined position statements for the clinician based on updated review of published literature and on multidisciplinary expert agreement. The goal was to propose defined terminology and rational diagnostic/therapeutic circuits based on current knowledge. To this end 14 sections related to complications and special forms of chronic pancreatitis (early chronic, groove and autoimmune pancreatitis) were reviewed by 21 specialists from 6 different fields to generate 32 statements. Featured statements assert common bile duct stenosis does not require invasive treatment (endoscopic or surgical) unless cholestasis, cholangitis, lithiasis or other symptoms develop. Pancreatic duct strictures and calculi should be approached (after ruling out malignancy) if causing pain, pancreatitis, pseudocysts or other complications. Treatment of symptomatic pseudocysts must be individualized, considering associated main duct stenosis, vascular and pericystic complications. Higher risk conditions for pancreatic cancer are advance age, smoking, genetic background, recent diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis or diabetes, and appearance of new symptoms. Groove pancreatitis can initially be treated with conservative measures. Both prednisolone or rituximab can induce remission and maintenance of autoimmune pancreatitis. Internal fistula, vascular complications, bacterial overgrowth, osteoporosis and renal lithiasis require specific therapeutic approaches.
