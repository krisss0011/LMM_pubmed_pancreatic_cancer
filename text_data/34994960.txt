We here report a case of pancreatic duct rupture associated with high-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia treated by radical resection. A 71-year-old man presented to our hospital because of abdominal bloating. Diagnoses of early-stage pancreatic body cancer with pancreatic duct rupture, pancreatic ascites, and formation of a pseudocyst were made on the basis of blood tests, multidetector dynamic computed tomography, endoscopic ultrasonography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. After achieving control of the ascites by placement of a pancreatic duct stent and aspiration of the pseudocyst, distal pancreatectomy with D2 lymph node dissection was performed. Intraoperative cytologic examination of the ascites was negative. The pathological diagnosis was high-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia in the pancreatic body. The branched pancreatic duct was occluded and dilated by acute inflammation around the pancreatic neoplasm, the inflammation being in the region of the dilated branched pancreatic duct and having caused its rupture. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published report of pancreatic duct rupture associated with high-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia.
