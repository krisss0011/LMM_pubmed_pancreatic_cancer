Purpose:Recent studies have demonstrated that kinetochore-associated protein 1 (KNTC1) plays a significant role in the carcinogenesis of numerous types of cancer. This study aimed to explore the role and possible mechanisms of KNTC1 in the development of pancreatic cancer.Methods and results:We analyzed differentially expressed genes by RNA sequencing in three paired pancreatic cancer and para-cancerous tissue samples and found that the expression of KNTC1 was significantly upregulated in pancreatic cancer. A Cancer and Tumor Gene Map pan-analysis showed that high expression of KNTC1 was related to poor prognosis in 9499 tumor samples. With immunohistochemical staining, we found that the high expression of KNTC1 in pancreatic cancer was related to pathological grade and clinical prognosis. Similarly, RT-PCR results indicated that the expression of KNTC1 was higher in three groups of pancreatic cancer cell lines (BxPC-3, PANC-1, and SW1990) than in normal pancreatic ductal cells. We introduced lentivirus-mediated shRNA targeting KNTC1 into PANC-1 and SW1990 cells and found that KNTC1 knockdown significantly decreased cell growth and increased cell apoptosis compared to the control group cells. Bioinformatic analysis of the cell expression profile revealed that differential genes were mainly enriched in the cell cycle, mitosis, and STAT3 signaling pathways, and co-immunoprecipitation confirmed an interaction between KNTC1 and cell division cycle associated 8.Conclusions:KNTC1 could be linked to the pathophysiology of pancreatic cancer and may be an early diagnostic marker of cervical precancerous lesions.
