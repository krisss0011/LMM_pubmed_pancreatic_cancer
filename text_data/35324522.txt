Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal types of cancer, mainly due to its delayed diagnosis and lack of effective therapeutic options. Therefore, it is imperative to find novel treatment options for PDAC. Here, we tested a series of conventional chemotherapeutics together with anthracycline compounds as single agents or in combination, determining their effectivity against established commercial and patient-derived, low-passage PDAC cell lines. Proliferation and colony formation assays were performed to determine the anticancer activity of anthracyclines; aclarubicin and doxorubicin, on commercial and patient-derived, low-passage PDAC cell lines. In addition, the effect of standard-of-care drugs gemcitabine and individual components of FOLFIRINOX were also investigated. To evaluate which mechanisms of cell death were involved in drug response, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase was evaluated by western blot. Aclarubicin showed superior antitumor activity compared to other anthracyclines and standard of care drugs (gemcitabine and individual components of FOLFIRINOX) in a patient-derived, low-passage PDAC cell line and in commercial cell lines. Importantly, the combination of gemcitabine and aclarubicin showed a synergistic effect at a dose range where the single agents by themselves were ineffective. In parallel, evaluation of the antitumor activity of aclarubicin demonstrated an apoptotic effect in all PDAC cell lines. Aclarubicin is cytotoxic for commercial and patient-derived low-passage PDAC cell lines, at doses lower than peak serum concentrations for patient treatment. Our findings support a (re)consideration of aclarubicin as a backbone of new combination regimens for pancreatic cancer patients.
