Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers in the world, causing hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide annually. Because of late diagnosis, rapid metastasis and drug resistance to chemotherapy, pancreatic cancer has a poor prognosis. Although the treatment of pancreatic cancer has made tremendous progress, the options for effective treatment are still limited, and new treatment methods are in crying needs to improve prognosis in clinic. Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent non-apoptotic cell death mode, which is mediated by lipid peroxidation and iron accumulation. Ferroptosis plays a momentous role in regulating different cancers in recent years, such as breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer and pancreatic cancer. In this present review, we elaborate on the regulatory mechanisms and signaling pathways of ferroptosis in pancreatic cancer, with the intention of delivering directions and new ideas for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
