Microbes and their metabolites are found in all body organs; their interaction with body organs can influence inflammation, immunity, and cancer development. Pancreatic cancer development is closely related to intestinal, intrapancreatic, and oral flora. The microbiota plays a regulatory role in pancreatic cancer's malignant progression and treatment resistance. Thus, the study of microbiota-host interactions has emerged as a new hot topic in pancreatic cancer treatment, with microbiota control demonstrating significant clinical potential. This review summarizes recent advances in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer, emphasizing the enormous potential for operating microbiota in pancreatic cancer treatment.
