Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest malignant tumors of the human digestive system. Due to its insidious onset, many patients have already lost the opportunity for radical resection upon tumor diagnosis. In recent years, neoadjuvant treatment for patients with borderline resectable PDAC has been recommended by multiple guidelines to increase the resection rate of radical surgery and improve the postoperative survival. However, further developments are required to accurately assess the tumor response to neoadjuvant therapy and to select the population suitable for such treatment. Reductions in drug toxicity and the number of neoadjuvant cycles are also critical. At present, the clinical evaluation of neoadjuvant treatment is mainly based on several serological and imaging indicators; however, the unique characteristics of PDAC and the insufficient sensitivity and specificity of the markers render this system ineffective. The imaging evaluation system, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), has its own unique imaging advantages compared with computed tomography (CT) and other imaging examinations. One key advantage is the ability to reflect the changes more rapidly in tumor tissue components, such as the degree of fibrosis, microvessel density, and tissue hypoxia. It can also perform multiparameter quantitative analysis of tumor tissue and changes, attributing to its increasingly important role in imaging evaluation, and potentially the evaluation of neoadjuvant treatment of pancreatic cancer, as several current articles have studied. At the same time, owing to the complexity of MRI and some of its limitations, its wider application is limited. Compared with CT imaging, few relevant studies have been conducted. In this review article, we will investigate and summarize the advantages, limitations, and future development of MRI in the evaluation of neoadjuvant treatment of PDAC.
