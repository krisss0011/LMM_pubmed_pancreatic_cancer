Pancreatic carcinoma (PC) is one of the most common and deadly human malignancies worldwide. LncRNAs play significant roles in the occurrence and development of various cancers. LncRNA SNHG11 (SNHG11) has been found to display high expression in serum of PC patients, which implies that dysregulated SNHG11 may be related to the development of PC. However, there is still a knowledge gap concerning the specific function and molecular mechanism of SNHG11 in PC. After conducting experiments with constructed models in vitro or in vivo, we found that exosomal SNHG11 promoted cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis but impeded cell apoptosis in PC in vitro, and additionally, it facilitated tumor growth in vivo. Exosome-mediated SNHG11 regulated the expression of VEGFA through sponging miR-324-3p. Rescue assays validated that the inhibitory effect of SNHG11 depletion on cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis could be reversed by miR-324-3p downregulation or VEGFA upregulation, and the promoting effect of SNHG11 silence on cell apoptosis could be rescued by transfection of miR-324-3p inhibitor or pcDNA3.1-VEGFA. To conclude, exosomal-mediated SNHG11 could regulate PC progression via miR-324-3p/VEGFA axis. Our findings may provide a novel insight for understanding PC, which might contribute to the development of potential PC biomarker.
