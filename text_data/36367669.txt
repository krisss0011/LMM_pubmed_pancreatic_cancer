Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the most common type of pancreatic cancer, is characterized by poor treatment response and low survival time. The current clinical treatment for advanced PDAC is still not effective. In recent years, the research and application of immunotherapy have developed rapidly and achieved substantial results in many malignant tumors. However, the translational application in PDAC is still far from satisfactory and needs to be developed urgently. To carry out the study of immunotherapy, it is necessary to fully decipher the immune characteristics of PDAC. This review summarizes the recent progress of the tumor microenvironment (TME) of PDAC and highlights its link with immunotherapy. We describe the molecular cues and corresponding intervention methods, collate several promising targets and progress worthy of further study, and put forward the importance of integrated immunotherapy to provide ideas for future research of TME and immunotherapy of PDAC.
