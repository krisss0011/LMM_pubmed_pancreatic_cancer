Background:Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a malignant cancer and chemotherapy ineffectively treats PDAC, leading to the requirement for alternative tumor-targeted treatment. Human amniotic fluid mesenchymal stem cells (hAFMSCs) have been revealed to suppress tumor growth in various cancers and they are a strong candidate for treating PDAC.Methods:To evaluate the effects of hAFMSCs on human pancreatic carcinoma cells (PANC1, AsPC1 and BxPC3 cell lines) and the possible mechanism involved, an in vitro cell coculture system was used. A PANC1 orthotopic xenograft mouse model was established and hAFMSCs were injected intravenously at 4 weeks post-xenograft.Results:An in vitro coculture assay showed that hAFMSCs inhibited PANC1 cell proliferation by inducing S phase cell cycle arrest and increased cell apoptosis in a time-dependent manner. In PANC1 cells, hAFMSCs caused the downregulation of Cyclin A and Cyclin B1 as well as the upregulation of p21 (CDKN1A) at 24 h post coculture. The upregulation of pro-apoptotic factors Caspase-3/-8 and Bax at 24 h post coculture reduced the migration and invasion ability of PANC1 cells through inhibiting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. In a PANC1 orthotopic xenograft mouse model, a single injection of hAFMSCs showed significant tumor growth inhibition with evidence of the modulation of cell cycle and pro-apoptotic regulatory genes and various genes involved in matrix metallopeptidase 7 (MMP7) signaling-triggered EMT process. Histopathological staining showed lower Ki67 levels in tumors from hAFMSCs-treated mice.Conclusions:Our data demonstrated that hAFMSCs strongly inhibit PDAC cell proliferation, tumor growth and invasion, possibly by altering cell cycle arrest and MMP7 signaling-triggered EMT.
