Pancreatic cancer is the 4th most common cause of cancer death in Germany and continues to be associated with a poor prognosis. A prerequisite for chemotherapy or radiotherapy is always the pathohistological (or cytological) confirmation of the tumor disease. Molecular diagnostics include analysis of DNA mismatch repair in the tumor and of the germline mutations in BRCA 1/2 (gBRCA mutation). Systemic chemotherapy remains the mainstay in the management of locally advanced and metastatic disease. If a gBRCA mutation is detected, platinum-based therapy should be used. Patients with good performance status benefit from second-line therapy. Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors (not yet approved) may be considered in pretreated patients with evidence of deficient DNA mismatch repair or microsatellite instability.
