Background:The treatment of pancreatic cancer (PDAC) remains clinically challenging, and neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) offers down staging and improved surgical resectability. Abundant fibrous stroma is involved in malignant characteristic of PDAC. We aimed to investigate tissue remodelling, particularly the alteration of the collagen architecture of the PDAC microenvironment by NAT.Methods:We analysed the alteration of collagen and gene expression profiles in PDAC tissues after NAT. Additionally, we examined the biological role of Ephrin-A5 using primary cultured cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs).Results:The expression of type I, III, IV, and V collagen was reduced in PDAC tissues after effective NAT. The bioinformatics approach provided comprehensive insights into NAT-induced matrix remodelling, which showed Ephrin-A signalling as a likely pathway and Ephrin-A5 (encoded by EFNA5) as a crucial ligand. Effective NAT reduced the number of Ephrin-A5+cells, which were mainly CAFs; this inversely correlated with the clinical tumour shrinkage rate. Experimental exposure to radiation and chemotherapeutic agents suppressed proliferation, EFNA5 expression, and collagen synthesis in CAFs. Forced EFNA5 expression altered CAF collagen gene profiles similar to those found in PDAC tissues after NAT.Conclusion:These results suggest that effective NAT changes the extracellular matrix with collagen profiles through CAFs and their Ephrin-A5 expression.
