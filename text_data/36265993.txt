Pancreatic cancer is a fatal malignancy that is projected to emerge as the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Despite the critical advances in surgical strategies, radiographic techniques, and systemic therapy, the treatment modality has remained largely unchanged over the past two decades eliciting a dire need for clinical trials in improving quality of life and prolonging survival in this patient population. Emergence of innovative strategies including novel combination chemotherapy, immunotherapy, vaccines, small compound drugs, among others is avenues under investigation to improve perioperative outcomes in localized pancreatic cancer.
