Purpose:Given the perioperative morbidity and intensity of multimodality treatment, patients with resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) spend a substantial amount of time in clinical care. The primary aim was to determine total time spent in multimodality care for patients with locoregional PDAC.Methods:A cohort study of all patients who underwent curative-intent resection for PDAC at a single-institution, tertiary care center was performed (2015-2019). Exact times for all relevant visits were abstracted from the primary medical record, and travel time was calculated. Care time was divided into preoperative, surgical, radiation, and systemic therapy phases of care. Primary outcome measures were the percentage of total survival time (TST) and percentage of overall survival (OS) days spent in receipt of care.Results:One hundred seven patients were included. Patients spent a median of 5.0% (interquartile range [IQR] 2.4%-10.1%) of TST and 11.0% (IQR, 5.7%-20.4%) of OS days in receipt of clinical care. Preoperative, surgical, radiation, and systemic therapy phases of care comprised a median of 0.9% (IQR, 0.4%-2.2%), 3.0% (IQR, 1.9%-6.8%), 4.4% (IQR, 3.6%-6.3%), and 10.0% (IQR, 6.2%-14.1%) of OS days. The median per-visit travel time was 60 minutes (IQR, 32-120), and the median cumulative travel time was 22.0 hours (IQR, 12.0-51.5). 12.1% (n = 13) and 7.8% (n = 4) of patients spent > 10% of TST in receipt of surgical and systemic therapy care, respectively.Conclusion:Patients with locoregional pancreatic cancer spend a considerable percentage of their survival time in receipt of oncologic care. Further research to determine predictors of increased time burden is warranted to better inform shared decision making.
