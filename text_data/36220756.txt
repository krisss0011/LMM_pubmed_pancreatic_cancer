Background/objectives:Patients with pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCN) generally undergo surveillance by cross-sectional imaging or endoscopic-ultrasound due to their pre-malignant potential. Appearance of certain cyst characteristics during surveillance is associated with aggressive behavior or presence of malignancy. Patient characteristics associated with progression or induction of malignancy in PCN is unclear from current studies. We performed this meta-analysis to determine the patient characteristics associated with progression or malignancy in patients with PCN who undergo surveillance.Methods:We performed a systematic research of several electronic databases for all the studies on surveillance of PCN which reported demographic data of patients who had progression or malignancy and controls. We calculated Risk ratio (RR) or Hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for each variable. Mantel- Haenszel method or Inverse-variance model was used to pool data of progression or malignant transformation into fixed or random effect model meta-analysis.Results:11observational studies, 4 assessing risk factors for malignancy (3955 patients) and 7 evaluating risk factors for progression of PCN (3144 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. Diabetes mellitus was associated with higher risk for malignant transformation as well as progression of PCN (RR = 1.54, CI 1.23, 1.92). Advanced age was associated with higher risk of progression. Male gender had higher risk for malignant transformation but not progression of PCN.Conclusion:Diabetes is associated with an increased risk of both malignancy and progression of PCN in patients who undergo surveillance. Advanced age is also associated with higher risk of progression of PCN.
