Although FOXD1 has been found to be involved in the malignant processes of several types of cancers, its role in pancreatic cancer (PC) is not well understood. This study aimed to investigate the expression and function of FOXD1 in PC. We found that FOXD1 mRNA and protein expression were upregulated in PC tissues compared with non-tumor tissues, and high expression level of FOXD1 was associated with an adverse prognostic index of PC. The results of in vitro and in vivo assays indicate that overexpression of FOXD1 promotes aerobic glycolysis and the capacity of PC cells to proliferate, invade, and metastasize, whereas FOXD1 knockdown inhibits these functions. The results of mechanistic experiments suggest that FOXD1 can not only directly promote SLC2A1 transcription but also inhibit the degradation of SLC2A1 through the RNA-induced silencing complex. As a result, FOXD1 enhances GLUT1 expression and ultimately facilitates PC cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis by regulating aerobic glycolysis. Taken together, FOXD1 is suggested to be a potential therapeutic target for PC.
