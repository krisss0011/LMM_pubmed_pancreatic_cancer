Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal malignant tumors. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for its progression are little known. This study aimed to understand the regulatory role of CD44V3 in pancreatic cancer. A Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to reveal the correlation between CD44/CD44V3 expression and the prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients.CD44V3andU2AF1were knocked down using shRNAs. The proliferation, migration, invasion, and stemness of two pancreatic cell lines, BxPC-3 and AsPC-1, were examined. The expression of CD44V3, cancer-associated markers, and the activation of AKT signaling were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Both CD44 and CD44V3 expression levels were associated with a poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients. Interestingly, the expression of CD44V3, instead of CD44, was greatly increased in tumor tissues.CD44V3knockdown inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion, and stemness of cancer cells.CD44V3splicing was regulated by U2AF1 and downregulation of U2AF1 enhanced CD44V3 expression, which promoted pancreatic cancer progression. CD44V3 is an important cancer-promoting factor, which may serve as a potential candidate for pancreatic cancer intervention.
