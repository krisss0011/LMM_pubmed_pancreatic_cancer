Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) support tumors via multiple mechanisms, including maintaining the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and limiting infiltration of immune cells. The prolyl isomerase Pin1, whose overexpression in CAFs has not been fully profiled yet, plays critical roles in tumor initiation and progression. To decipher effects of selective Pin1 inhibition in CAFs on pancreatic cancer, here we formulate a DNA-barcoded micellular system (DMS) encapsulating the Pin1 inhibitor AG17724. DMS functionalized with CAF-targeting anti-FAP-Î± antibodies (antiCAFs-DMS) can selectively inhibit Pin1 in CAFs, leading to efficacious but transient tumor growth inhibition. We further integrate DNA aptamers (AptT), which can engage CD8+ T lymphocytes, to obtain a bispecific antiCAFs-DMS-AptT system. AntiCAFs-DMS-AptT inhibits tumor growth in subcutaneous and orthotopic pancreatic cancer models.
