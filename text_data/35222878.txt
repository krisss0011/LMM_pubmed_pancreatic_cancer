MicroRNAs (miRNAs) act as a kind of small and noncoding RNA, which have been implicated in the regulation of various pathobiological processes in cancer, including progression in pancreatic cancer and in other human cancers. Previous reports demonstrate that pancreatic cancer has been reported as one of the leading causes of cancer-related death, and some factors including oncogenic genes and environments are involved in tumorigenesis. In our study, we found microRNA-146a (miR-146a) was evidently downregulated in pancreatic cancer tissues and cells. Overexpression of miR-146a obviously reduced cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in vitro, as determined by MTT analysis, colony formation analysis, EdU analysis, and cell cycle experiments. Here, we found tumor suppressor sex-determining region Y-box 7 (SOX7) was the direct target of miR-146a. Overexpression of miR-146a decidedly inhibited SOX7 expression, which promotes cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Knockdown of miR-146a increased SOX7 expression. Depression of miR-146a and SOX7 promoted cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in vitro, confirming miR-146a regulated pancreatic cancer cell proliferation by inhibiting SOX7. In summary, we found miR-146a reduced the cell proliferation of pancreatic cancer through targeting SOX7. In the present study, we demonstrated the function of miR-146a in pancreatic cancer and might provide a new target in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
