Background & objectives:Inflammation has been studied to be an important contributory factor to carcinogenesis through pro-inflammatory markers such as interleukin (IL)-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP). Furthermore, K-ras mutation is an important genetic alteration in the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer. This study aimed to compare these inflammatory markers in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with the diseased and healthy controls (HCs) and to check for any association between IL-6 and CRP serum levels with the disease status, survival and K-ras mutation status of PDAC patients.Methods:The study included 135 PDAC, 25 chronic pancreatitis (CP) patients and 25 HCs. The serum levels of IL-6 and CRP were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and K-ras mutations were detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique.Results:The serum levels of both these markers were elevated in PDAC cases than that in HCs. High IL-6 levels and higher CRP levels were found to be associated with locally advanced disease, lymphatic invasion, metastasis and advanced stage of the PDAC. In patients with unresectable PDAC, higher IL-6 levels were found to be associated with the presence of K-ras mutations.Interpretation & conclusions:Higher IL-6 and CRP levels in patients with advanced PDAC suggest an important role of these inflammatory markers in tumour progression. Furthermore, the association of mutations in the K-ras gene with serum IL-6 indicates cross-talks that may contribute to the progression of the PDAC.
