Artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning (ML), is being slowly incorporated in medical practice, to provide a more precise and personalized approach. Pancreatic surgery is an evolving field, which offers the only curative option for patients with pancreatic cancer. Increasing amounts of data are available in medicine: AI and ML can help incorporate large amounts of information in clinical practice. We conducted a systematic review, based on PRISMA criteria, of studies that explored the use of AI or ML algorithms in pancreatic surgery. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review on this topic. Twenty-five eligible studies were included in this review; 12 studies with implications in the preoperative diagnosis, while 13 studies had implications in patient evolution. Preoperative diagnosis, such as predicting the malignancy of IPMNs, differential diagnosis between pancreatic cystic lesions, classification of different pancreatic tumours, and establishment of the correct management for each of these lesions, can be facilitated through different AI or ML algorithms. Postoperative evolution can also be predicted, and some studies reported prediction models for complications, including postoperative pancreatic fistula, while other studies have analysed the implications for prognosis evaluation (from predicting a textbook outcome, the risk of metastasis or relapse, or the mortality rate and survival). One study discussed the possibility of predicting an intraoperative complication-massive intraoperative bleeding. Artificial intelligence and machine learning models have promising applications in pancreatic surgery, in the preoperative period (high-accuracy diagnosis) and postoperative setting (prognosis evaluation and complication prediction), and the intraoperative applications have been less explored.
