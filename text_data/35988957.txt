Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest malignancies. Therefore, there is an urgent need to detect pancreatic cancer in an earlier stage to improve outcomes. A variety of hereditary cancer syndromes have been associated with an increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer, and these individuals may benefit from surveillance programs. Surveillance programs have shown potential to improve outcomes, but have important risks such as overtreatment. In this review we will discuss the definitions and epidemiology of hereditary pancreatic cancer, recommendations for genetic testing and participation in surveillance. Important aspects are differences in surveillance strategies, target lesions, and potential benefits and harms of surveillance. Lastly we will highlight future directions for research and improvement of care for individuals at high-risk of pancreatic cancer.
