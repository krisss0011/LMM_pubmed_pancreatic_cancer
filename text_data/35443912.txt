Background:Family history of pancreatic cancer (PC) and some hereditary cancer syndromes are risk factors for PC. Previous studies suggest that conducting surveillance for kindreds at high risk for familial PC may be useful for diagnoses at the stage where resections can still be implemented; however, there is insufficient evidence linking surveillance and increased rates of resectable PC.Methods:We launched a surveillance study for kindreds with familial PC and individuals with hereditary PC syndrome, titled the "Diamond Study," in June 2020. This Japanese national multi-institutional prospective intervention study has been initiated to conduct evaluations within a prospective clinical trial format.Results:The primary endpoint is the fraction of patients with resectable PC among patients with PC found through surveillance interventions. Endoscopic ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging combined with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography will be performed alternatively every 6 months for up to 15 years, with 400 as the predicted number of registered participants and a predicted registration period of 10 years.Conclusion:We intend to scientifically prove the usefulness of surveillance for kindreds with familial PC and individuals with hereditary PC syndrome to improve PC prognoses.
