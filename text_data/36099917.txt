Plasma cell responses are associated with anti-tumor immunity and favorable response to immunotherapy. B cells can amplify anti-tumor immune responses through antibody production; yet B cells in patients and tumor-bearing mice often fail to support this effector function. We identify dysregulated transcriptional program in B cells that disrupts differentiation of naive B cells into anti-tumor plasma cells. The signaling network contributing to this dysfunction is driven by interleukin (IL) 35 stimulation of a STAT3-PAX5 complex that upregulates the transcriptional regulator BCL6 in naive B cells. Transient inhibition of BCL6 in tumor-educated naive B cells is sufficient to reverse the dysfunction in B cell differentiation, stimulating the intra-tumoral accumulation of plasma cells and effector T cells and rendering pancreatic tumors sensitive to anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade. Our findings argue that B cell effector dysfunction in cancer can be due to an active systemic suppression program that can be targeted to synergize with T cell-directed immunotherapy.
