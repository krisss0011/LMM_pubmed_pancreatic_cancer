In the tumor microenvironment, the extracellular matrix (ECM) has been recognized as an important part of cancer development. The dominant ECM proteins are the 28 types of collagens, each with a unique function in tissue architecture. Type XX collagen, however, is poorly characterized, and little is known about its involvement in cancer. We developed an ELISA quantifying type XX collagen, named PRO-C20, using a monoclonal antibody raised against the C-terminus. PRO-C20 and PRO-C1, an ELISA targeting the N-terminal pro-peptide of type I collagen, was measured in sera of 219 patients with various solid cancer types and compared to sera levels of 33 healthy controls. PRO-C20 was subsequently measured in a separate cohort comprising 36 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and compared to 20 healthy controls and 11 patients with chronic pancreatitis. PRO-C20 was significantly elevated in all cancers tested: bladder, breast, colorectal, head and neck, kidney, lung, melanoma, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, and stomach cancer (p < 0.01−p < 0.0001). PRO-C1 was only elevated in patients with ovarian cancer. PRO-C20 could discriminate between patients and healthy controls with AUROC values ranging from 0.76 to 0.92. Elevated levels were confirmed in a separate cohort of patients with PDAC (p < 0.0001). High PRO-C20 levels (above 2.57 nM) were predictive of poor survival after adjusting for the presence of metastasis, age, and sex (HR: 4.25, 95% CI: 1.52−11.9, p-value: 0.006). Circulating type XX collagen is elevated in sera of patients with various types of cancer and has prognostic value in PDAC. If validated, PRO-C20 may be a novel biomarker for patients with solid tumors and can help understand the ECM biology of cancer.
