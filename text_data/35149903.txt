Purpose:Osteopenia typically presents low bone mineral density (BMD) and has recently been reported as a prognostic factor in various cancers. However, the prognostic value of osteopenia in digestive tract cancers remains to be defined. We aimed to review the prognostic value of preoperative osteopenia in patients with digestive cancers.Methods:Cohort studies evaluating the prognostic value of preoperative osteopenia in digestive cancers (colorectal, esophageal, hepatic, bile duct, and pancreatic cancer) were searched using electronic databases and trial registries. The exposure was defined as low BMD estimated by computed tomography at 11ththoracic vertebra, while comparator was normal BMD. The primary outcomes were overall survival and recurrence-free survival for osteopenia. Random effect meta-analyses were performed. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence.Results:A total of 11 studies (2230 patients) were included. Osteopenia was an independent risk factor for overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.02, 95% CI = 1.47 to 2.78; I2= 74%), along with sarcopenia. Osteopenia also predicted poor recurrence-free survival (HR = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.36 to 2.81; I2= 85%). In subgroup analyses, osteopenia predicted prognosis in colorectal, esophageal, hepatic, and bile duct cancers, but not in pancreatic cancer. The certainty of the evidence was low due to inconsistency and publication bias.Conclusion:Osteopenia may be independently associated with poor prognosis in patients with digestive tract cancer. Further studies are needed to establish the relevance of osteopenia in the operative prognosis of these patients.
