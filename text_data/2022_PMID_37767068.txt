INTRODUCTION: The phase III IMbrave150 study established atezolizumab + 
bevacizumab as standard of care in patients with unresectable hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC). This exploratory analysis reports efficacy and safety results 
in patients with baseline Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B disease.
METHODS: Patients with systemic treatment-naive unresectable HCC and Child-Pugh 
class A liver function were randomized 2:1 to receive 1,200 mg of atezolizumab 
plus 15 mg/kg of bevacizumab or 400 mg of sorafenib. Co-primary endpoints were 
overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) per independent review 
facility (IRF)-assessed Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) 
version 1.1 in the BCLC stage B subgroup. Patients in this analysis had BCLC 
stage B disease at baseline per electronic case report form. Secondary efficacy 
endpoints included the objective response rate (ORR) and change in the sum of 
longest diameters (SLD) of target lesions from baseline per IRF RECIST 1.1 and 
modified RECIST (mRECIST) for HCC.
RESULTS: Of 501 enrolled patients, 74 (15%) had BCLC stage B disease at baseline 
(atezolizumab + bevacizumab, n = 49; sorafenib, n = 24). For this group, median 
follow-up was 19.7 months. A trend toward improved OS and PFS per IRF RECIST 1.1 
was observed with atezolizumab + bevacizumab versus sorafenib (OS: hazard ratio 
[HR]: 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.29, 1.34; PFS: HR: 0.64; 95% CI: 
0.36, 1.12). ORRs per IRF RECIST 1.1 and HCC mRECIST were 43% and 50% with 
atezolizumab + bevacizumab and 26% and 30% with sorafenib, respectively. 
Percentage change in SLD of target lesions from baseline per IRF RECIST 1.1 and 
HCC mRECIST showed durable responses with atezolizumab + bevacizumab treatment. 
Safety data were consistent with known profiles of atezolizumab and bevacizumab, 
as seen in the overall study population.
DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Efficacy benefits were observed with atezolizumab + 
bevacizumab in patients with baseline BCLC stage B disease, consistent with the 
intention-to-treat population.
