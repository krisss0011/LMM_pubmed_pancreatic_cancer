Objective:To investigate the impact of the dosage of intraoperative opioids on postoperative survival of pancreatic cancer patients who underwent pancreatectomy.Methods:The clinical data of 95 patients with pancreatic cancer who underwent pancreatectomy at Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital from September 2013 to August 2018 were retrospectively collected. Dosage of intraoperative opioid medications was converted to fentanyl equivalent dose. Patients were divided into high-dose group (fentanyl consumption â‰¥2.21 mg,n=46) and low-dose group (fentanyl consumption<2.21 mg,n=49) according to the median intra-operative fentanyl equivalents. The relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) between the two groups were compared. Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to analyze the impact of important covariates on RFS and OS.Results:RFS of patients in low-dose group at 1, 3 and 5 years was 75.5%, 26.5% and 15.2% respectively. OS of patients in low-dose group at 1, 3 and 5 years was 77.6%, 32.5% and 24.4% respectively. RFS of patients in high-dose group at 1, 3 and 5 years was 76.1%, 23.9% and 12.0% respectively. OS of patients in high-dose group at 1, 3 and 5 years was 76.1%, 37.0% and 15.0%. There was no significant difference in RFS and OS between the two groups (allP>0.05). Multivariate Cox analysis showed that dosage of intraoperative fentanyl was not associated with RFS (HR=1.205, 95%CI: 0.737-1.970,P=0.456) or OS (HR=1.062, 95%CI: 0.634-1.778,P=0.818).Conclusion:Dosage of intraoperative opioid has no effect on RFS and OS in pancreatic cancer patients undergoing pancreatectomy.
