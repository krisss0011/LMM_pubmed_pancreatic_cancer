Background:Enrollment criteria are routinely utilized in patient selection in SEER-Medicare but little is known about how this may be impacting research outcomes. This study evaluated demographics and survival among pancreatic cancer patients who are included and excluded from SEER-Medicare analyses.Methods:Patients â‰¥66 years old with pancreatic cancer were identified (SEER-Medicare, 2008-2015). Two patient cohorts were compared: included (continuous enrollment in Medicare Parts A and B and no enrollment in Medicare Advantage), and excluded. Mortality was assessed using a Standardized Mortality Ratio.Results:Among 49,017 patients with pancreatic cancer, 59.5% were in the included cohort. The excluded cohort was younger (median age 74 vs. 77) with more male (49.9% vs. 47.8%), non-white (33.0% vs. 21.3%) and urban-dwelling patients (91.0% vs. 85.0%). Those excluded had a higher mortality risk (SMR 1.06, 95%CI 1.04-1.07).Conclusions:There are significant differences in patient demographics and mortality among those who are and are not routinely included in SEER-Medicare analyses and our study provides a critical opportunity to quantify this potential bias.
