Background:Artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning (ML) and deep learning, has the potential to revolutionize biomedical research. Defined as the ability to "mimic" human intelligence by machines executing trained algorithms, AI methods are deployed for biomarker discovery.Objective:We detail the advancements and challenges in the use of AI for biomarker discovery in ovarian and pancreatic cancer. We also provide an overview of associated regulatory and ethical considerations.Methods:We conducted a literature review using PubMed and Google Scholar to survey the published findings on the use of AI in ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, and cancer biomarkers.Results:Most AI models associated with ovarian and pancreatic cancer have yet to be applied in clinical settings, and imaging data in many studies are not publicly available. Low disease prevalence and asymptomatic disease limits data availability required for AI models. The FDA has yet to qualify imaging biomarkers as effective diagnostic tools for these cancers.Conclusions:Challenges associated with data availability, quality, bias, as well as AI transparency and explainability, will likely persist. Explainable and trustworthy AI efforts will need to continue so that the research community can better understand and construct effective models for biomarker discovery in rare cancers.
