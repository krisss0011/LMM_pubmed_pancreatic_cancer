Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive disease with high mortality, largely due to late stage at diagnosis. Approximately 10% to 15% are hereditary, and detection of early stage PDAC or precursor lesions through pancreatic surveillance programs may improve outcomes. Current surveillance is annual, typically with endoscopic ultrasound and/or magnetic resonance imaging.
