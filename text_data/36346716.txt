Background:Neoadjuvant therapy is increasingly being used before surgery for localized pancreatic cancer. Given the importance of completing multimodal therapy, the aim of this study was to characterize surgical resection rates after neoadjuvant therapy as well as the reasons for, and long-term prognostic impact of, not undergoing resection.Methods:A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective trials and high-quality retrospective studies since 2010 was performed to calculate pooled resection rates using a generalized random-effects model for potentially resectable, borderline resectable, and locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Median survival times were calculated using random-effects models for patients who did and did not undergo resection.Results:In 125 studies that met the inclusion criteria, neoadjuvant therapy consisted of chemotherapy (36.8 per cent), chemoradiation (15.2 per cent), or chemotherapy and radiation (48.0 per cent). Among 11 713 patients, the pooled resection rates were 77.4 (95 per cent c.i. 71.3 to 82.5), 60.6 (54.8 to 66.1), and 22.2 (16.7 to 29.0) per cent for potentially resectable, borderline resectable, and locally advanced pancreatic cancer respectively. The most common reasons for not undergoing resection were distant progression for resectable and borderline resectable cancers, and local unresectability for locally advanced disease. Among 42 studies with survival data available, achieving surgical resection after neoadjuvant therapy was associated with improved survival for patients with potentially resectable (median 38.5 versus 13.3 months), borderline resectable (32.3 versus 13.9 months), and locally advanced (30.0 versus 14.6 months) pancreatic cancer (P < 0.001 for all).Conclusion:Although rates of surgical resection after neoadjuvant therapy vary based on anatomical stage, surgery is associated with improved survival for all patients with localized pancreatic cancer. These pooled resection and survival rates may inform patient-provider decision-making and serve as important benchmarks for future prospective trials.
