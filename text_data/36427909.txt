The physin family of proteins, synaptophysin (SYP), synaptophysin like 1 (SYPL1), synaptophysin like 2 (SYPL2) and synaptoporin (SYNRP), are tetratransmembrane transport vesicle proteins distributed throughout the digestive system. Of these, SYP is a required marker for histopathologic identification of neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs), especially in gastroenteropancreatic NENs (GEP-NENs). Recently, bloodstream SYP, i.e., on platelets and circulating tumor cells, has been correlated to clinicopathologic features of GEP-NENs and may have prognostic significance. Serum SYPL1 also represents a promising biomarker for colorectal cancer. This chapter provides an overview of physin structures and potential use as diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic tools for digestive tract neoplasms.
