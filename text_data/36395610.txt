Abnormal intracellular metabolism not only provides nutrition for tumor occurrence and development, but also sensitizes the function of various immune cells in the immune microenvironment to promote tumor immune escape. This review discusses the emerging role of immune cells in the progress of pancreatic cancer, acrossing metabolic reprogramming and key metabolic pathways present in different immune cell types. At present, the hotspots of metabolic reprogramming of immune cells in pancreatic cancer progression mainly focuses on glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, tricarboxylic acid cycle and amino acid metabolism, which affect the function of anti-tumor immune cells and immunosuppressive cells in the microenvironment, such as macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, neutrophils and B cells by a series of key metabolic signaling pathways, such as PI3K/AKT, mTOR, AMPK, HIF-1Î±, c-Myc and p53. Drugs that target the tumor metabolism pathways for clinical treatment of pancreatic cancer are also systematically elaborated, which may constitute food for others' projects involved in clinical anti-cancer research.
