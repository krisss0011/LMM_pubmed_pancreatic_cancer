While the associations between individual lifestyle factors and risk of pancreatic cancer were studied extensively, their combined impact has not been examined. We evaluated the association of a composite score of healthy lifestyle factors, including body mass index, cigarette smoking, the Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010 (AHEI-2010), sleep duration, and physical activity with pancreatic cancer risk in the Singapore Chinese Health Study, an ongoing prospective cohort study of 63,257 Chinese aged 45 to 74 years at enrollment in 1993 to 1998 with up to 25 years of follow up. Cox proportional hazard regression method was used to estimate HR and its 95% confidence interval (CI) with adjustment for multiple potential confounders. We identified 316 incident pancreatic cancer cases among the cohort participants after a mean 17 years of follow up. Individuals with higher composite scores representing healthier lifestyle were at significantly lower risk of pancreatic cancer. The multivariate-adjusted HRs (95% CIs) of pancreatic cancer incidence for the composite scores 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 to 7 were 0.60 (0.50-0.91), 0.48 (0.32-0.71), 0.45 (0.31-0.67), 0.41 (0.27-0.62), and 0.38 (0.24-0.62), respectively, compared with the scores 0 to 1 (Ptrend< 0.0001). The inverse association was more apparent among participants without diabetes history and was robust in men and women as well as in alcohol drinkers and nondrinkers. In summary, the association for pancreatic cancer risk was stronger for the aggregated than individual healthy lifestyle factors. These findings suggest that a more comprehensive lifestyle modification strategy would be more effective for prevention of pancreatic cancer than the change of a single lifestyle factor. PREVENTION RELEVANCE: In this large prospective Asian study, we calculated a composite score of healthy lifestyle factors, including body mass index, cigarette smoking, the Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010 (AHEI-2010), sleep duration, and physical activity and found this composite score was associated with a significant reduction in pancreatic cancer risk, by as much as 62%. This finding suggests that public health programs emphasizing comprehensive lifestyle modification strategy would be more effective for prevention of pancreatic cancer than the change of a single lifestyle factor.
