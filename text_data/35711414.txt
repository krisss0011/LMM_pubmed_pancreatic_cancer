Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) represents 90% of all pancreatic cancer cases and shows a high mortality rate among all solid tumors. PDAC is often associated with poor prognosis, due to the late diagnosis that leads to metastasis development, and limited efficacy of available treatments. The tumor microenvironment (TME) represents a reliable source of novel targets for therapy, and even if many of the biological interactions among stromal, immune, and cancer cells that populate the TME have been studied, much more needs to be clarified. The great limitation in the efficacy of current standard chemoterapy is due to both the dense fibrotic inaccessible TME barrier surrounding cancer cells and the immunological evolution from a tumor-suppressor to an immunosuppressive environment. Nevertheless, combinatorial therapies may prove more effective at overcoming resistance mechanisms and achieving tumor cell killing. To achieve this result, a deeper understanding of the pathological mechanisms driving tumor progression and immune escape is required in order to design rationale-based therapeutic strategies. This review aims to summarize the present knowledge about cellular interactions in the TME, with much attention on immunosuppressive functioning and a specific focus on extracellular matrix (ECM) contribution.
