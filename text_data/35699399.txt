Background and objectives:To describe the patterns of disease relapse and follow-up of patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Additionally, we looked at patients' characteristics at relapse and survival.Methods:We included patients with potentially resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma diagnosed from 2008 to 2018 who were submitted to resection with clear macroscopic margins and started posttreatment surveillance.Results:The study population consists of 73 patients. The median interval between imaging studies was 3.2 months during the first 2 years of follow-up and 5.1 months thereafter. Forty-eight patients (65.8%) experienced disease relapse. The most frequent single site of relapse was locoregional (N = 21; 43.8%). At relapse, 31 patients (64.6%) were symptomatic and forty-two patients (87.6%) had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1. Most patients were able to undergo additional anticancer therapy (N = 41; 85.4%). Patients with asymptomatic relapses experienced longer median postrelapse survival (25.4 vs. 11.3 months; p = 0.015).Conclusions:A follow-up protocol that included imaging studies every 3 months in the first 2 years and every 6 months thereafter is able to diagnose disease relapse when patients have adequate performance status and are still able to undergo additional anticancer treatment.
