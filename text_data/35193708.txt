We tested the ability of a novel DNA methylation biomarker set to distinguish metastatic pancreatic cancer cases from benign pancreatic cyst patients and to monitor tumor dynamics using quantitative DNA methylation analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from blood samples. The biomarkers were able to distinguish malignant cases from benign disease with high sensitivity and specificity (AUC = 0.999). Furthermore, the biomarkers detected a consistent decline in tumor-derived cfDNA in samples from patients undergoing chemotherapy. The study indicates that our liquid biopsy assay could be useful for management of pancreatic cancer patients.
