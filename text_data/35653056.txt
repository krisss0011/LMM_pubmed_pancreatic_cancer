Background:The aim of this study is to analyze the role of neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and its variation pre- and postoperatively (delta NLR) in the overall survival after pancreatectomy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) at a single center and to identify factors associated with overall survival.Methods:A retrospective study of consecutive patients undergoing pancreatectomy due to PDAC or undifferentiated carcinoma from January 2010 to January 2020 was performed. Association between the evaluated factors and overall survival was analyzed using a log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard regression model.Results:Overall, 242 patients underwent pancreatectomy for PDAC or undifferentiated carcinoma. OS was 22.8 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 19.5-29), and survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 72%, 32.5%, and 20.8%, respectively. NLR and delta NLR were not significantly associated with survival (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.14, 95%CI: 0.77-1.68, p = 0.5). Lymph node ratio was significantly associated (HR = 1.66, 95%CI: 1.21-2.26, p = 0.001) in the bivariate analysis. In multivariable analysis, the only factors that were significantly associated with survival were perineural invasion (HR = 1.94, 95%CI: 1.21-3.14, p = 0.006), surgical margin (HR = 1.83, 95%CI: 1.10-3.02, p = 0.019), tumor size (HR = 1.01, 95%CI: 1.003-1.027, p = 0.16), postoperative CA 19-9 level (HR = 1.001, p < 0.001), and completion of adjuvant treatment (HR = 0.53, 95%CI: 0.35-0.8, p = 0.002).Conclusion:Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and delta NLR were not associated with the overall survival in this cohort. Risk factors such as perineural invasion, surgical margins, CA19-9 level, and tumor size showed worse survival in this study, whereas completing adjuvant treatment was a protective factor.
