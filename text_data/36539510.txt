Programmed death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) help tumor cells evade immune surveillance, and are regarded as important targets of anti-tumor immunotherapy. Post-translational modification of PD-L1 has potential value in immunosuppression. Here, we identified that ubiquitin-specific protease 8 (USP8) deubiquitinates PD-L1. Pancreatic cancer tissues exhibited significantly increased USP8 levels compared with those in normal tissues. Clinically, the expression of USP8 showed a significant association with the tumor-node-metastasis stage in multiple patient-derived cohorts of pancreatic cancer. Meanwhile, USP8 deficiency could reduce tumor invasion and migration and tumor size in an immunity-dependent manner, and improve anti-tumor immunogenicity. USP8 inhibitor pretreatment led to reduced tumorigenesis and immunocompetent mice with Usp8 knockdown tumors exhibited extended survival. Moreover, USP8 interacted positively with PD-L1 and upregulated its expression by inhibiting the ubiquitination-regulated proteasome degradation pathway in pancreatic cancer. Combination therapy with a USP8 inhibitor and anti-PD-L1 effectively suppressed pancreatic tumor growth by activation of cytotoxic T-cells and the anti-tumor immunity was mainly dependent on the PD-L1 pathway and CD8 + T cells. Our findings highlight the importance of targeting USP8, which can sensitize PD-L1-targeted pancreatic cancer to immunotherapy and might represent a novel therapeutic strategy to treat patients with pancreatic tumors in the future.
