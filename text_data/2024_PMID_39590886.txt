PD-L1 siRNA: A Preclinical Investigation.

OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the anticancer potential of genetically modified 
exosomes engineered to express CD133-binding peptides on their surface and carry 
PD-L1 siRNA for the treatment of murine model of metastatic pancreatic cancer.
METHODS: CD133-targeting exosomes (tEx) were generated by harvesting conditioned 
media from adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) that had undergone transformation 
using pDisplay vectors encoding CD133-binding peptide sequences. Subsequently, 
siPD-L1-loaded CD133-targeting Exosomes, referred to as tEx(s), were created by 
incorporating PD-L1 siRNA into the tEx using Exofect kit.
RESULTS: tEx(s) demonstrated superior targetability compared to other materials, 
including Ex, Ex(p), and tEx. This was substantiated by higher Total Radiant 
Efficiency (TRE) observed in metastatic liver and pancreatic tissues following 
intravenous administration of tEx(s) (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the intravenous 
delivery of tEx(s) resulted in the most pronounced upregulation of pro-apoptotic 
markers (BIM and c-caspase 3) and the least downregulation of the anti-apoptotic 
markers (Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL) which has been demonstrated in various methods, 
including RT-PCR, Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry in the 
metastatic lesions in the livers (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: PD-L1 siRNA-loaded CD133-targeting exosomes demonstrated remarkable 
anticancer efficacy, characterized by specific binding to CD133-positive 
pancreatic cancer cells and suppression of PD-L1 expression within these cells.
