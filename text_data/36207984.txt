Objective:To compare the short-term and long-term prognosis of irreversible electroporation(IRE) and conversional resection for locally advanced pancreatic cancer(LAPC).Methods:The clinical and pathological data of 98 LAPC patients who underwent IRE or conversional resection at the Department of Pancreatobiliary Surgery,Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center from August 2015 to December 2020 were retrospectively collected and analyzed.The study comprised of 53 males and 45 females, with age(M(IQR)) of 57.5(13.5)years old(range:20 to 87 years old). Fifty-three patients received IRE treatment(IRE group) and 45 patients received surgical resection(resection group). The differences of clinical and pathological data between both groups were not significant(allP<0.05). The Mann-WhitneyUtest was used for quantitative data and the χ2test was used for categorical data.Survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method and compared using Log-rank test.Results:The operation time and intraoperative blood loss were 5.0(2.4)hours and 50(100) ml in the IRE group,respectively,which were significantly less than those of resection group(7.0(3.3)hours and 400(200)ml,bothP<0.05).The hospital stay and hospitalization cost were 9.0(3.0)days and 79 154 (83 738) yuan in the IRE group,respectively,which were also significantly less than those in the resection group(16.0(8.5)days and 109 557(37 795)yuan,bothP<0.05).The complication rate of IRE group was significantly lower than that of the resection group(18.8%vs.55.6%,χ2=14.270,P<0.01).The median overall survival(OS) time of IRE group was 28.9 months(95%CI:23.2 to 34.6 months),with the 1-,2-,and 3-year OS rates of 91.6%,61.7%,and 24.6%,respectively.The median survival of OS of resection group was 27.1 months(95%CI:20.9 to 33.3 months),with the 1-,2-,and 3-year OS rates of 81.8%,53.9%,and 30.3%,respectively.There was no significant difference in OS between the two groups(χ2=0.900,P=0.760).The median progression free survival(PFS) time of IRE group was 18.0 months(95%CI:14.7 to 21.3 months),with the 1-,2-,and 3-year PFS rates of 68.3%,29.7%,and 9.9%,respectively.The median survival of PFS of resection group was 11.1 months(95%CI:6.1 to 16.2 months),with the 1-,2-,and 3-year PFS rates of 45.2%,21.9%,and 14.6%,respectively.There was no significant difference in PFS between the two groups(χ2=1.850,P=0.170).Conclusion:IRE can achieve similar survival for LAPC and may has less complications compared to those with conversion resection.
