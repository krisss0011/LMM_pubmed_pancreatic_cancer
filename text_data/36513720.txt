Oncolytic virus (OV) therapy is a promising cancer immunotherapy, especially for cold tumors by inducing the direct lysis of cancer cells and initiation of potent antitumor response. Canerpaturev (C-REV) is an attenuated oncolytic herpes simplex virus-1, which demonstrated a potent antitumor effect in various preclinical models when used either alone or combined. Metformin is a commonly prescribed antidiabetic drug that demonstrated a potent immune modulator effect and antitumor response. We combined C-REV with metformin in a low immunogenic bilateral murine tumor model to enhance C-REV's antitumor efficacy. In vitro, metformin does not enhance the C-REV cell cytotoxic effect. However, in in vivo model, intratumoral administration of C-REV with the systemic administration of metformin led to synergistic antitumor effect on both sides of tumor and prolonged survival. Moreover, combination therapy increased the effector CD44+CD8+PD1-subset and decreased the proportion of terminally-differentiated CD103+KLRG-1+T-regulatory cells on both sides of tumor. Interestingly, combination therapy efficiently modulates conventional dendritic cells type-1 (cDC1) on tumors, and tumor-drained lymph nodes. Our findings suggest that combination of C-REV and metformin enhances systemic antitumor immunity. This study may provide insights into the mechanism of action of OV therapy plus metformin combination against various tumor models.
