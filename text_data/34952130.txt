Introduction:Adenosquamous cancer of the pancreas (ASCP) is an aggressive, infrequent subtype of pancreatic cancer that combines a glandular and squamous component and is associated with poor survival.Methods:Multicenter retrospective observational study carried out at three Spanish hospitals. The study period was: January 2010-August 2020. A descriptive analysis of the data was performed, as well as an analysis of global and disease-free survival using the Kaplan-Meier statistic.Results:Of a total of 668 pancreatic cancers treated surgically, twelve were ASCP (1.8%). Patient mean age was 69.2±7.4 years. Male/female ratio was 1:1. The main symptom was jaundice (seven patients). Correct preoperative diagnosis was obtained in only two patients. Nine pancreatoduodenectomies and three distal pancreatosplenectomies were performed. 25% had major complications. Mean tumor size was 48.6±19.4mm. Nine patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. Median survival time was 5.9 months, and median disease-free survival was 4.6 months. 90% of patients presented recurrence. Ten of the twelve patients in the study (83.3%) died, with disease progression being the cause in eight. Of the two surviving patients, one is disease-free and the other has liver metastases.Conclusion:ASCP is a very rare pancreatic tumor with aggressive behavior. It is rarely diagnosed preoperatively. The best treatment, if feasible, is surgery followed by the standard chemotherapy regimens for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
