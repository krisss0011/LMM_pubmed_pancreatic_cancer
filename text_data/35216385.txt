HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) represent promising anti-cancer treatments, as the acetylation of histone and non-histone proteins is often dysregulated in cancer and contributes to cancer onset and progression. HDACi have been also reported to increase the cytotoxicity of DNA-damaging agents, such as radiation or cisplatin. In this study, we found that TSA and, even more effectively, VPA synergized with AZD2461, PARP1, 2 and 3 inhibitor (PARPi) to induce DNA damage and reduce pancreatic cancer cell survival. At a molecular level, VPA and TSA down-regulated CHK1 and RAD51, which is correlated with the interruption of the cross-talk between mutp53 and HSP70. Moreover, VPA and to a lesser extent TSA reactivated wtp53 in these cells, which contributed to CHK1 and RAD51 reduction. These findings suggest that the combination of HDACi and PARPi might improve the treatment of pancreatic cancer, which remains one of the most aggressive and therapy-resistant cancers.
