Background:Main-duct (MD) intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is associated with malignancy risk. There is a lack of consensus on treatment (partial or total pancreatectomy) when the MD is diffusely involved. We sought to characterize the pancreatic remnant fate after partial pancreatectomy for non-invasive diffuse MD-IPMN.Methods:Consecutive patients with partial pancreatectomy for non-invasive MD-IPMN from 2004 to 2016 were analyzed. Diffuse MD-IPMN was defined by preoperative imaging as dilation of the MD in the head of the pancreas more than 5 mm and involving the whole gland.Results:Of 127 patients with resected non-invasive MD-IPMN, 47 (37%) had diffuse MD involvement. Eleven of 47(23%) patients developed imaging evidence of progression or new cystic disease in the pancreatic remnant. Patients with diffuse MD-IPMN were older (73yrs vs 67yrs, p = 0.009), more likely to receive a pancreaticoduodenectomy (96% vs 56%, p < 0.001) and have high-grade dysplasia (51% vs 31%, p = 0.025) than those with focal MD involvement. Diffuse MD involvement was not associated with shorter PFS following partial pancreatectomy (p = 0.613).Conclusion:Partial pancreatectomy is an appropriate surgical approach for diffuse MD-IPMN, and is not associated with earlier progression after surgery as compared to partial pancreatectomy for focal dilation.
