The phosphorylation of histone H2A.X into γH2A.X is a crucial early event in the 
DNA damage response, marking DNA damage sites and initiating repair processes. 
While ATM kinase is traditionally recognized as the primary mediator of H2A.X 
phosphorylation, our study identifies serine/threonine kinase 39 (STK39) as a 
novel enhancer of this critical signaling pathway. We demonstrate that after DNA 
damage, STK39 undergoes phosphorylation by the ATM kinase, facilitating its 
interaction with the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex and subsequent recruitment to 
chromatin. This recruitment enables STK39 to further phosphorylate H2A.X, thus 
amplifying γH2A.X production and promoting homologous recombination repair. 
Notably, we observe a significant upregulation of STK39 in pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma (PAAD) tissues, correlating with heightened resistance to PARPi 
therapy. Furthermore, we demonstrate the synergistic efficacy of combining STK39 
inhibition with PARP inhibitors in suppressing and reversing PAAD growth. This 
study not only provides new insights into the molecular dynamics of H2A.X 
phosphorylation but also highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting STK39 
to enhance PARPi sensitivity in PAAD (created with BioRender).
