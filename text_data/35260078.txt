Background:Transmembrane protein 43 (TMEM43), a member of the transmembrane protein subfamily, plays a critical role in the initiation and development of cancers. However, little is known concerning the biological function and molecular mechanisms of TMEM43 in pancreatic cancer.Methods:In this study, TMEM43 expression levels were analyzed in pancreatic cancer samples compared with control samples. The relationship of TMEM43 expression and disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed in pancreatic cancer patients. In vitro and in vivo assays were performed to explore the function and role of TMEM43 in pancreatic cancer. Coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) followed by protein mass spectrometry was applied to analyze the molecular mechanisms of TMEM43 in pancreatic cancer.Results:We demonstrated that TMEM43 expression level is elevated in pancreatic cancer samples compared with control group, and is correlated with poor DFS and OS in pancreatic cancer patients. Knockdown of TMEM43 inhibited pancreatic cancer progression in vitro, decreased the percentage of S phase, and inhibited the tumorigenicity of pancreatic cancer in vivo. Moreover, we demonstrated that TMEM43 promoted pancreatic cancer progression by stabilizing PRPF3 and regulating the RAP2B/ERK axis.Conclusions:The present study suggests that TMEM43 contributes to pancreatic cancer progression through the PRPF3/RAP2B/ERK axis, and might be a novel therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer.
