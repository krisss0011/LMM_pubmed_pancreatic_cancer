Rationale and objectives:To compare dual energy CT (DECT) quantitative metrics and radiomics for differentiating benign and malignant pancreatic lesions on contrast enhanced abdomen CT.Materials and methods:Our study included 103 patients who underwent contrast-enhanced DECT for assessing focal pancreatic lesions at one of the two hospitals (Site A: age 68 ± 12 yrs; malignant = 41, benign = 18; Site B: age 46 ± 2 yrs; malignant = 23, benign = 21). All malignant lesions had histologic confirmation, and benign lesions were stable on follow up CT (>12 months) or had characteristic benign features on MRI. Arterial-phase, low- and high-kV DICOM images were processed with the DECT Tumor Analysis (DETA) to obtain DECT quantitative metrics such as HU, iodine and water content from a region of interest (ROI) over focal pancreatic lesions. Separately, we obtained DECT radiomics from the same ROI. Data were analyzed with multiple logistic regression and receiver operating characteristics to generate area under the curve (AUC) for best predictive variables.Results:DECT quantitative metrics and radiomics had AUCs of 0.98-0.99 at site A and 0.89-0.94 at site B data for classifying benign and malignant pancreatic lesions. There was no significant difference in the AUCs and accuracies of DECT quantitative metrics and radiomics from lesion rims and volumes among patients at both sites (p > 0.05). Supervised learning-based model with data from the two sites demonstrated best AUCs of 0.94 (DECT radiomics) and 0.90 (DECT quantitative metrics) for characterizing pancreatic lesions as benign or malignant.Conclusion:Compared to complex DECT radiomics, quantitative DECT information provide a simpler but accurate method of differentiating benign and malignant pancreatic lesions.
