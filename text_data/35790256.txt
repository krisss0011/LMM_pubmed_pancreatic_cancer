Background/aim:Anti-apoptotic proteins, including Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, hinder cancer treatment, and several drugs targeting these molecules have been developed. One is ABT-263 (navitoclax), which targets Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w. On the other hand, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been used as a drug for malaria infection and autoimmune disease. HCQ can exert a similar effect as chloroquine with fewer adverse events. In addition, HCQ exerts antitumor activity. In the present study, the effects of HCQ on ABT-263-induced antitumor activities were examined using three human pancreatic cancer cell lines (PANC-1, MiaPaCa-2, and BxPC-3).Materials and methods:In vitro effects of HCQ and ABT-263 were examined by cell viability, colony-forming assays, and flow cytometry. Protein expression was determined by immunoblotting. In vivo effects of HCQ and ABT-263 were examined by a xenograft mice model.Results:Combined treatment with HCQ and ABT-263 synergistically decreased the viability of only BxPC-3 cells. This synergistic effect was not observed when HCQ was combined with ABT-199, an inhibitor specific to Bcl-2. The combination of HCQ and ABT-263 induced caspase-dependent apoptosis. Protein expression of Bcl-xL was more highly expressed in BxPC-3 cells than in the other two cell lines, and the combination of HCQ with a Bcl-xL inhibitor or siRNA-mediated knockdown of Bcl-xL induced apoptosis in BxPC-3 cells. Combination therapy with HCQ and ABT 737, an ABT-263 analogue, suppressed the in vivo growth of BxPC-3 with transient body-weight loss.Conclusion:HCQ effectively promotes Bcl-xL inhibition-induced apoptosis in BxPC-3 human pancreatic cancer cells.
