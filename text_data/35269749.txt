Semaphorins (SEMAs) are axon guidance factors that participate in axonal connections and nerve system development. However, the functional roles of SEMAs in tumorigenesis are still largely uncovered. By using in silico data analysis, we found that SEMA6C was downregulated in pancreatic cancer, and its reduction was correlated with worse survival rates. RNA sequencing revealed that cell cycle-related genes, especially cyclin D1, were significantly altered after blockage of SEMA6C by neutralizing antibodies or ectopic expressions of SEMA6C. Mechanistic investigation demonstrated that SEMA6C acts as a tumor suppressor in pancreatic cancer by inhibiting the AKT/GSK3 signaling axis, resulting in a decrease in cyclin D1 expression and cellular proliferation. The enhancement of cyclin D1 expression and cyclin-dependent kinase activation in SEMA6C-low cancer created a druggable target of CDK4/6 inhibitors. We also elucidated the mechanism underlying SEMA6C downregulation in pancreatic cancer and demonstrated a novel regulatory role of miR-124-3p in suppressing SEMA6C. This study provides new insights of SEMA6C-mediated anti-cancer action and suggests the treatment of SEMA6C-downregulated cancer by CDK4/6 inhibitors.
