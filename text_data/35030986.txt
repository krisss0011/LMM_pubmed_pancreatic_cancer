The role of DNA methylation and its interplay with gene expression in the susceptibility to pancreatic cancer (PanC) remains largely unexplored. To fill in this gap, we conducted an integrative two-phase epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of PanC using genomic DNA from 44 cases and 556 controls (20 local controls and 536 public controls in the Framingham Heart Study) in phase 1 and 23 cases and 22 controls in phase 2. We validated the findings using pre-diagnostic blood samples from 13 cases and 26 controls in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Study. We further examined gene expression in peripheral leukocytes of 47 cases and 31 controls involved in the methylation study using RNA sequencing and performed bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using existing single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. In phase 1, we identified 2776 significantly differentially methylated CpG sites (DMPs) and 154 significantly differentially methylated regions (DMRs). In phase 2, we validated six DMPs (in or nearAIM2, DGKA, STK39, andTNFSF8) and three DMRs (in or nearnc886, LY6G5C, andHLA-DPB1). The DMR nearnc886was further validated in the WHI samples (P = 6.69 Ã— 10-5). MR analysis suggested that the CpG sites cg00308130 and cg16684184 fornc886and cg16875057 forSTK39were causally related to PanC susceptibility and that PanC influenced methylation of cg15354065 forDGKA. This first integrative EWAS of PanC provides novel insights into the role of DNA methylation and its interplay with SNPs and gene expression in the disease susceptibility.
