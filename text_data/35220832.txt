Introduction:Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has become a serious health problem with high impact worldwide. The heterogeneity of PDAC makes it difficult to apply drug delivery systems (DDS) used in other cancer models, for example, the poorly developed vascular system makes anti-angiogenic therapy ineffective. Due to its various malignant pathological changes, drug delivery against PDAC is a matter of urgent concern. Based on this situation, various drug delivery strategies specially designed for PDAC have been generated.Areas covered:This review will briefly describe how delivery systems can be designed through nanotechnology and formulation science. Most research focused on penetrating the stromal barrier, exploiting and alleviating the hypoxic microenvironment, targeting immune cells, or designing vaccines, and combination therapies. This review will summarize the ways to reverse the malignant pathological features of PDAC and hopefully provide ideas for subsequent studies.Expert opinion:Drug delivery systems designed to achieve penetrating functions or to alleviate hypoxia and activate immunity have achieved good therapeutic results in animal models in several studies. In future studies, there is a need to deliver PDAC therapeutics in a more precise manner, or the use of drug carriers for multiple functions simultaneously, are potential therapeutic strategy.
