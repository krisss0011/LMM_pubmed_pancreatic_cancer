Objective:Previously, we reported that insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1) immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed high sensitivity for neuroendocrine carcinoma of the uterine cervix and was an effective method for histopathological diagnosis, but that its specificity remained to be verified. Therefore, the aim was to verify the specificity of INSM1 IHC for a large number of non-neuroendocrine neoplasia (NEN) of the cervix.Methods:RNA sequences were performed for cell lines of small cell carcinoma (TCYIK), squamous cell carcinoma (SiHa), and adenocarcinoma (HeLa). A total of 104 cases of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded specimens, 16 cases of cervical NEN and 88 cases of cervical non-NEN, were evaluated immunohistochemically for conventional neuroendocrine markers and INSM1. All processes without antigen retrieval were performed by an automated IHC system.Results:The transcripts per million levels of INSM1 in RNA sequences were 1505 in TCYIK, 0 in SiHa, and HeLa. INSM1 immunoreactivity was shown only in the TCYIK. Immunohistochemical results showed that 15 cases of cervical NEN showed positive for INSM1; the positivity score of the tumor cell population and the stain strength for INSM1 were high. Two of the 88 cases of cervical non-NENs were positive for INSM1 in one case each of typical adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. The sensitivity of INSM1 for cervical NEN was 94%; specificity, 98%; the positive predictive value, 88%; and the negative predictive value, 99%.Conclusion:INSM1 is an adjunctive diagnostic method with excellent specificity and sensitivity for diagnosing cervical NEN. Higher specificity can be obtained if morphological evaluation is also performed.
