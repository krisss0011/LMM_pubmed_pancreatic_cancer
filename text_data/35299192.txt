A 76-year-old male was diagnosed as locally advanced pancreatic cancer because abdominal CT scan revealed a pancreatic head tumor with involvement of the proper hepatic artery. Gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel was initiated, but was discontinued because interstitial pneumonia was occurred. The treatment was switched to S-1 therapy and achieved stable disease for 22 months. Therefore, conversion surgery was scheduled. Because stenosis of the celiac artery origin due to median arcuate ligament(MAL)compression and dilatation of pancreatoduodenal artery arcade were observed, laparoscopic MAL section was performed. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 5 without complications. Postoperative CT scan revealed no stenosis of the celiac artery origin and disappearance of dilatation of pancreatoduodenal artery arcade. On postoperative day 14, subtotal stomach-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy(PD)with portal vein resection was performed. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 19 without complications. Two-staged PD after MAL section make possible to evaluate blood flow accurately and select an appropriate operative method. Laparoscopic MAL section is minimally invasive and may be useful for two-staged PD in patients with celiac axis stenosis.
