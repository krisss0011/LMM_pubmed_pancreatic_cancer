While patients with resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) show improved survival compared to their non-resectable counterparts, survival remains low owing to occult metastatic disease and treatment resistance. Liquid biopsy based on circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has been shown to predict recurrence and treatment resistance in various types of cancers, but their utility has not been fully demonstrated in resectable PDAC. We have simultaneously tracked three circulating biomarkers, including CTCs, cfDNA, and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), over a period of cancer treatment using a microfluidic device and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). The microfluidic device is based on the combination of filtration and immunoaffinity mechanisms. We have measured CTCs, cfDNA, and ctDNA in a cohort of seven resectable PDAC patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery, and each patient was followed up to 10 time points over a period of 4 months. CTCs were detectable in all patients (100%) at some point during treatment but were detectable in only three out of six patients (50%) prior to the start of treatment. Median cfDNA concentrations remained comparable to negative controls throughout treatment. ddPCR was able to find KRAS mutations in six of seven patients (86%); however, these mutations were present in only two of seven patients (29%) prior to treatment. Overall, the majority of circulating biomarkers (81% for CTCs and 91% for cfDNA/ctDNA) were detected after the start of neoadjuvant therapy but before surgery. This study suggests that a longitudinal study of circulating biomarkers throughout treatment provides more useful information than those single time-point tests for resectable PDAC patients.
