Pancreatic cancer is digestive cancer with limited therapeutic options and a poor outcome. Pancreatic cancer has a high mortality rate, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 5%. The median survival after metastasis of the disease is less than 6 months. Studies have revealed that the standard treatment, including palliative chemotherapy or immunotherapy, is not significantly effective for pancreatic cancer. Herein, we report a case of pancreatic cancer who benefited from a combination of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy and chemotherapy.
