Background:Due to the aging population, the number of older patients diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) will continue to rise.Study design:Utilizing the NCDB from 2010 to 2016, patients with early stage, clinically node negative PDAC who were ≥70 years old and had a Whipple were identified. Multivariable logistic regressions were used to determine independent factors for R0 resection and NAT. Cox-proportional-hazards regression analyses examined for the impact of NAT on the risk of death.Results:Of 5086 patients, 51.7% received upfront surgery + adjuvant therapy (UFS + AT), followed by 29.9% UFS only, and the remainder NAT. NAT significantly improved OS compared to a combined cohort of those that had UFS ± AT. NAT retained its independent survival benefit when compared to only patients that had UFS + AT.Conclusion:For older patients diagnosed with early stage PDAC, NAT was associated with improved R0 resection rates and a significant survival benefit when compared to the current standard of care.
