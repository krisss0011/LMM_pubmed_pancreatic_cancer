Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is highly refractory to treatment. Standard-of-care gemcitabine (Gem) provides only modest survival benefits, and development of Gem resistance (GemR) compromises its efficacy. Highly GemR clones of Gem-sensitive MIAPaCa-2 cells were developed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of GemR and implemented global quantitative differential proteomics analysis with a comprehensive, reproducible ion-current-based MS1 workflow to quantify âˆ¼6000 proteins in all samples. In GemR clone MIA-GR8, cellular metabolism, proliferation, migration, and 'drug response' mechanisms were the predominant biological processes altered, consistent with cell phenotypic alterations in cell cycle and motility. S100 calcium binding protein A4 was the most downregulated protein, as were proteins associated with glycolytic and oxidative energy production. Both responses would reduce tumor proliferation. Upregulation of mesenchymal markers was prominent, and cellular invasiveness increased. Key enzymes in Gem metabolism pathways were altered such that intracellular utilization of Gem would decrease. Ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase large subunit was the most elevated Gem metabolizing protein, supporting its critical role in GemR. Lower Ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase large subunit expression is associated with better clinical outcomes in PDAC, and its downregulation paralleled reduced MIAPaCa-2 proliferation and migration and increased Gem sensitivity. Temporal protein-level Gem responses of MIAPaCa-2 versus GemR cell lines (intrinsically GemR PANC-1 and acquired GemR MIA-GR8) implicate adaptive changes in cellular response systems for cell proliferation and drug transport and metabolism, which reduce cytotoxic Gem metabolites, in DNA repair, and additional responses, as key contributors to the complexity of GemR in PDAC. These findings additionally suggest targetable therapeutic vulnerabilities for GemR PDAC patients.
