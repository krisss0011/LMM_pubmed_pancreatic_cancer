Background:First-line palliative chemotherapy regimens in advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma include triplet chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan, and the doublet of nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine. Use of triplet chemotherapy in real-world populations is limited by tolerability and nab-paclitaxel is not universally available. Regimens using the combination of cisplatin, capecitabine, gemcitabine, and either epirubicin or docetaxel may be better tolerated, more widely available, and similarly effective, but no published real-world data exist.Methods:A retrospective cohort review of patients with metastatic or unresectable locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with first-line palliative cisplatin, capecitabine, gemcitabine, and either epirubicin or docetaxel chemotherapy at Auckland City Hospital between July 1, 2013 and July 30, 2020. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Secondary outcomes were rates of grade 3 or 4 hematological toxicity, rate of febrile neutropenia, number of cycles received, and reasons for discontinuation.Results:Eighty-eight patients were included. Median age was 66 years (range 39-79), 28.4% had unresectable, locally advanced disease and 71.6% metastatic disease. Median OS was 8.5 months. Patients stopped treatment due to disease progression (53.4%), completing 12 cycles (19.3%), or toxicity (10.2%). Grade 4 neutropenia was experienced by 21.6%; 10.2% had febrile neutropenia. There were four treatment-related deaths.Conclusion:This retrospective study in a real-world population demonstrates that chemotherapy with cisplatin, capecitabine, and gemcitabine with epirubicin (PEXG) or docetaxel (PDXG) had similar effectiveness to more commonly used combination regimens. PDXG/PEXG are viable alternatives to nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine in countries that have restricted drug funding.
