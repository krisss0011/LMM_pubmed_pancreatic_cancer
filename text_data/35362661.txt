Background/purpose:The detection ability and role of different imaging modalities to detect pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (PNENs) including small lesions is unclear. This study aimed to compare the ability of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and computed tomography (CT) to detect PNENs.Methods:Data of patients who underwent EUS and contrast-enhanced CT and were diagnosed with PNENs were analyzed. The detection rates of pancreatic lesions with EUS and CT based on tumor size and influencing factors were investigated.Results:For 256 PNEN lesions, the detection rate of EUS was better than that of CT (94.5% vs 86.3%; P < .001). EUS was significantly superior to CT for PNENs ≤5 mm (58.3% vs 16.7%; P = .006) and 5-10 mm (97.7% vs 79.5%; P = .008). There was no significant difference in the detection rate between EUS and CT for PNENs >10 mm (98.4% vs 96.4%; P = .375). Size (≤5 mm) and insulinoma were independent factors associated with poor EUS and CT detection rates.Conclusions:Endoscopic ultrasound exhibited better detection ability than CT, with an excellent detection rate for PNENs >5 mm, except for insulinomas. CT could detect PNENs >10 mm, which are amenable to treatment.
