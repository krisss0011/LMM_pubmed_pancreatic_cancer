Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is a widely accepted treatment for progressive grade 1 and 2 (G1-2) gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NET). There is increasing evidence that PRRT is effective for selected patients with well-differentiated (WD) G3 NET, which are now separated from neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC). These preliminary data have led to prospective PRRT trials currently in progress. This article provides an update of the current role of PRRT for patients with WD-G3 NET, highlighting the importance of patient selection based on molecular imaging phenotype, as well as outlining some potential future directions in this field. Upcoming prospective trials will help define the role, sequencing, and optimization of PRRT to improve outcomes of patients with WD-G3 NET.
