Pancreatic cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Unfortunately, therapeutic gains in the treatment of other cancers have not successfully translated to pancreatic cancer treatments. Management of pancreatic cancer is difficult due to the lack of effective therapies and the rapid development of drug resistance. The cytotoxic agent gemcitabine has historically been the first-line treatment, but combinations of other immunomodulating and stroma-depleting drugs are currently undergoing clinical testing. Moreover, the treatment of pancreatic cancer is complicated by its heterogeneity: analysis of genomic alterations and expression patterns has led to the definition of multiple subtypes, but their usefulness in the clinical setting is limited by inter-tumoral and inter-personal variability. In addition, various cell types in the tumor microenvironment exert immunosuppressive effects that worsen prognosis. In this review, we discuss current perceptions of molecular features and the tumor microenvironment in pancreatic cancer, and we summarize emerging drug options that can complement traditional chemotherapies.
