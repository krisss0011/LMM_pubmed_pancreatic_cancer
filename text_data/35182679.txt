The lactate receptor HCAR1 (hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 1) is highly expressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), where it regulates lactate transport between the cancer cells. Little is known about the underlying cause of high HCAR1 expression in PDAC, and in the present study, we investigated whether HCAR1 could be a target of miRNA regulation. By searching for predicted miRNA candidates in silico, we identified miR-431-5p as a possible regulator of HCAR1. We found miR-431-5p to repress HCAR1 expression through direct binding to the 3' UTR. The endogenous expression of miR-431-5p and HCAR1 was found to be negatively related in the PDAC cell lines BxPC-3, Capan-2, and PANC-1. Overexpression of miR-431-5p inhibited cell proliferation in all the cell lines, and a shift in cell cycle progression and induction of apoptosis were found in the BxPC-3 cells. Transcriptomic analysis of mRNA from BxPC-3 cells revealed numerous differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including HCAR1, in response to miR-431-5p overexpression. A significant proportion of these DEGs was enriched in cancer-related processes and signalling pathways. Among the most significantly repressed DEGs was ATP6V0E1, encoding the integral subunit e of vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase), an enzyme that is important for cancer cell survival. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of HCAR1 and ATP6V0E1 showed that only knockdown of ATP6V0E1 mimicked the effect of miR-431-5p overexpression on cell viability. Our findings indicate that miR-431-5p acts as a tumour suppressor in PDAC cells, with BxPC-3 cells being most responsive.
