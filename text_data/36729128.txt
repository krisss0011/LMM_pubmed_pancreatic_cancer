Pancreatic cancer is mostly metastaticat diagnosis. BR east CA ncer gene (BRCA) mutations are associated with platinum sensitivity in metastatic pancreatic cancer. However, curative surgery and complete remission are infrequent. In this report, we present a 42-year-old female patient diagnosed with BRCA-mutated pancreatic cancer with liver metastases. After 12 cycles of FOLFIRINOX, liver metastases disappeared and the patient underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. The patient has been followed in complete remission for 5 years. To the best of our knowledge, the presented case is the longest recurrence-free survival after platinum-based therapy in metastatic pancreatic cancer with BRCA mutation. Our case emphasizes that investigating BRCA gene mutations at the time of diagnosis can be life-saving in these patients.
