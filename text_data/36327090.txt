Purpose:Neoadjuvant therapy (NT) is increasingly utilized for patients with localized pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Patients with cancer have high information needs and the Internet has materialized as a leading source of information for many patients. Nevertheless, little is known about the availability, accessibility, quality, and readability of online information regarding NT for PDAC.Methods:A search of online patient informational materials (PIMs) pertaining to NT for PDAC was conducted using a combination of common search engines and browsers. Two independent researchers evaluated the readability, quality, and availability of unique PIMs from the top 25 websites from each search using validated measures.Results:Among the 130 websites retrieved, 46 (35.4%) unique PIMs focused on treatment of PDAC. Only 30 (23%) mentioned NT as a possible treatment option. Downstaging was the rationale for NT mentioned in the majority (90%) of websites. The mean quality and reliability of the 30 PIMs, assessed using the DISCERN instrument, was 3.3 ± 0.7, suggesting moderate quality/reliability. The mean readability score, assessed using the SMOG Grade tool, was 10.96 ± 1.49, which is equivalent to an 11th grade reading level.Conclusion:The low availability, poor readability, and moderate quality of online informational materials regarding NT for PDAC highlight the need for new patient-centered resources to educate patients and caregivers on an increasingly utilized treatment strategy for localized PDAC.
