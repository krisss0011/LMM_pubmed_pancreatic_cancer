Effective treatments are urgently needed for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Anlotinib is a novel small-molecule multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor with broad inhibitory effects on tumor growth and angiogenesis. Here, we present an advanced pancreatic cancer patient, who respond to anlotinib targeted therapy after the failure of multiline chemotherapy and apatinib targeted therapy. Anlotinib was given orally at a dose of 10 mg once daily (2 weeks on/1 week off), and progression-free survival was 5.6 months. The adverse reaction of anlotinib was elevated aminotransferase and fatigue, but it was tolerable and reversible. Our case indicates that anlotinib might be effective in the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer. This case report may offer a new targeted treatment option for heavily treated advanced pancreatic cancer.
