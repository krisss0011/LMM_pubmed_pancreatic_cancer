Gemcitabine (GEM) drug resistance remains a difficult challenge in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) treatment. Therefore, identifying a safe and effective treatment strategy for PDAC is urgent. Lucidone is a natural compound extracted from the fruits of Lindera erythrocarpa Makino. However, the role of lucidone in PDAC inhibition remains unclear. In addition, high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) are involved in multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) regulation and GEM resistance. Thus, this study aimed to explore the function of lucidone in tumor cytotoxicity and chemosensitivity through the suppression of RAGE-initiated signaling in PDAC cells. The data showed that lucidone significantly promoted apoptotic cell death and inhibited the expression of autophagic proteins (Atg5, Beclin-1, LC3-II, and Vps34) and MDR1 by inhibiting the HMGB1/RAGE/PI3K/Akt axis in both MIA Paca-2 cells and MIA Paca-2GEMRcells (GEM-resistant cells). Notably, convincing data were also obtained in experiments involving RAGE-specific siRNA transfection. In addition, remarkable cell proliferation was observed after treatment with lucidone combined with GEM, particularly in MIA Paca-2GEMRcells, indicating that lucidone treatment enhanced chemosensitivity. Collectively, this study provided the underlying mechanism by which lucidone treatment inhibited HMGB1/RAGE-initiated PI3K/Akt/MDR1 signaling and consequently enhanced chemosensitivity in PDAC.
