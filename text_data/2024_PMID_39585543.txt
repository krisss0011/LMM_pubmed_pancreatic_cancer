Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has proven to be a formidable cancer 
primarily due to its tumor microenvironment (TME). This highly desmoplastic, 
hypoxic, and pro-inflammatory environment has not only been shown to facilitate 
the growth and metastasis of PDAC but has also displayed powerful 
immunosuppressive capabilities. A critical cell involved in the development of 
the PDAC TME is the fibroblast, specifically the antigen-presenting 
cancer-associated fibroblast (apCAF). The pro-inflammatory environment of PDAC 
induces the proliferation of apCAFs, promoting immunosuppression through immune 
cell inactivation, immune response regulation, and expression of CD74. In 
conjunction with apCAFs and tumor cells, CD74 serves as a versatile promoter of 
PDAC by preventing tumor antigen-expression on tumor cells, upregulating the 
expression of immunosuppressive chemical mediators, and activating proliferative 
pathways to induce PDAC malignancy. This review will highlight critical 
mediators and pathways that promote the PDAC stroma and TME with its hypoxic and 
immunosuppressive properties. Further, we will highlight the nature of apCAFs 
and CD74, their specific roles in the PDAC TME, and their potential as targets 
for immunotherapy.
