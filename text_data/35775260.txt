Objective:To investigate the safety and feasibility of minimally invasive pancreatic tumor enucleation.Methods:The clinicopathological data of 60 patients with minimally invasive pancreatic tumor enucleation admitted to the Department of Pancreatic Surgery of Fudan University Cancer Center from November 2019 to August 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. There were 17 males and 43 females,with age of (50.0±13.2)years(range: 23 to 73 years). Tumors were located in the head of pancreas in 40 cases(66.7%),neck and tail of pancreas in 20 cases(33.3%). Patients were divided into robotic group(n=25) and laparoscopic group(n=35) according to surgical methods. The measurement data were compared byt-test or Mann-WhitneyUtest, and the categorical data were compared by χ2test or Fisher exact probability method. The influencing factors of postoperative pancreatic fistula were analyzed by univariate and multivariate Logistic regression.Results:All patients successfully completed tumor enucleation without conversion to laparotomy. The operation time was (183.5±67.3)minutes(range:90 to 410 minutes). Twelve patients(20.0%) underwent stent placement and pancreatic duct repair during operation. The removal time of abdominal drainage tube after operation was (24.7±22.9)days(range:2 to 113 days). The tumor diameter in the robotic group was larger than that in the laparoscopic group((3.5±0.9)cmvs.(2.9±0.7)cm,t=-2.825,P=0.006). The incidences of postoperative biochemical fistula and grade B pancreatic fistula were 20.0%,22.9% and 36.0%,51.4%,respectively(χ²=2.289,P=0.318). There were no grade C pancreatic fistula,lymphatic fistula,biliary fistula,delayed gastric emptying,secondary operation and perioperative death in both groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed on the occurrence of clinically related pancreatic fistula(above grade B). The results showed that the increase of body mass index(OR=1.285,95%CI:1.053 to 1.569,P=0.014),the larger diameter of the tumor(OR=3.703,95%CI:1.465 to 9.360,P=0.006) and intraoperative pancreatic duct repair(OR=7.889,95%CI:1.471 to 42.296,P=0.016) were independent risk factors,whereas robotic surgery(OR=0.168,95%CI:0.036 to 0.796,P=0.025) was a protective factor. No case of pancreatin dependent dyspepsia and new onset diabetes mellitus was observed.Conclusions:Minimally invasive tumor enucleation is feasible in the treatment of benign and low-grade pancreatic tumors. The incidence of pancreatic fistula is high in the short term after operation,but serious complications are rare. The robot assisted system can reduce the risk of postoperative pancreatic fistula and has more advantages in dealing with larger diameter tumors because of clearer surgical vision and more accurate operation.
