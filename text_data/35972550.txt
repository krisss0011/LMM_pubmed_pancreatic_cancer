Purpose:To evaluate the significance of CT perfusion parameters predicting response to neoadjuvant therapy in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).Materials and methods:Seventy patients with PDAC prospectively had CT perfusion acquisition incorporated into baseline multiphase staging CT. Twenty-eight who were naïve to therapy were retained for further investigation. Perfusion was performed 5-42.5 s after contrast, followed by parenchymal and portal venous phases. Blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), and permeability surface area product (PS) were calculated using deconvolution algorithms. Patients were categorized as responders or non-responders per RECIST 1.1. Perfusion variables with AUC ≥ 0.70 in differentiating responders from non-responders were retained. Logistic regression was used to assess associations between baseline perfusion variables and response.Results:18 of 28 patients showed favorable response to therapy. Baseline heterogeneity variables in tumor max ROI were higher in non-responders than responders [median BF coefficient of variation (CV) 0.91 vs. 0.51 respectively, odds ratio (OR) 6.8 per one standard deviation (1-SD) increase, P = 0.047; median PS CV 1.6 vs. 0.68, OR 3.9 per 1-SD increase, P = 0.047; and median BV CV 0.75 vs. 0.54, OR = 4.0 per 1-SD increase, P = 0.047]. Baseline BV mean in tumor center was lower in non-responders than responders (median BV mean: 0.74 vs. 2.9 ml/100 g respectively, OR 0.28 per 1-SD increase, P = 0.047).Conclusion:For patients with PDAC receiving neoadjuvant therapy, lower and more heterogeneous perfusion parameters correlated with an unfavorable response to therapy. Such quantitative information can be acquired utilizing a comprehensive protocol interleaving perfusion CT acquisition with standard of care multiphase CT scans using a single contrast injection, which could be used to identify surgical candidates and predict outcome.
