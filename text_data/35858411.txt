The major challenges in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) management are local or distant metastasis and limited targeted therapeutics to prevent it. To identify a druggable target in tumor secretome and to explore its therapeutic intervention, we performed a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based proteomic analysis of tumors obtained from a patient-derived xenograft model of PDAC. Galectin-3 binding protein (Gal-3BP) is identified as a highly secreted protein, and its overexpression is further validated in multiple PDAC tumors and primary cells. Knockdown and exogenous treatment of Gal-3BP showed that it is required for PDAC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Mechanistically, we revealed that Gal-3BP enhances galectin-3-mediated epidermal growth factor receptor signaling, leading to increased cMyc and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. To explore the clinical impact of these findings, two antibody clones were developed, and they profoundly abrogated the metastasis of PDAC cells in vivo. Altogether, our data demonstrate that Gal-3BP is an important therapeutic target in PDAC, and we propose its blockade by antibody as a therapeutic option for suppressing PDAC metastasis.
