Importance:Only a few high-volume centers have reported on long-term oncologic outcomes after minimally invasive pancreatic surgery (MIPS) for pancreatic adenocarcinoma, but none of them have shown superior long-term overall survival (OS) compared with open pancreatic surgery (OPS).Objective:To study long-term survival after MIPS and OPS with curative intent among patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.Design, setting, and participants:This comparative effectiveness study used a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained electronic database of patient data collected between January 2010 and December 2019. Consecutive patients from a high-volume pancreatic cancer referral center were included. Data analysis was conducted from March to October 2022. Median follow-up time was 56.8 months.Exposures:Patients were matched using propensity score models to study long-term survival.Main outcomes and measures:Survival outcomes were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model. Variables used for propensity score correction were TNM stage, tumor dimension, lymph node status, type of operation, simultaneous vascular resection, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, sex, age, and American Society of Anesthesiologists score. Additional corrections were made for year of surgery and type of adjuvant chemotherapy.Results:After propensity score matching the sample of 396 patients, there were 198 patients in the MIPS group (89 [44.9%] men; median [range] age, 68 [32-87] years) and 198 in the OPS group (94 [47.5%] men; median [range] age, 67 [39-84] years). Median OS in the MIPS group was 30.7 (95% CI, 26.2-36.8) months compared with 20.3 (95% CI, 17.6-23.5) months after OPS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.70; 95% CI, 0.56-0.87; P = .002). Median disease-free survival (DFS) after MIPS vs OPS was 14.8 (95% CI, 11.8-17.0) months vs 10.7 (95% CI, 9.0-12.1) months (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.57-0.89; P = .003). Additional corrections for year of surgery and type of adjuvant chemotherapy showed better OS (year of surgery: HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.57-0.96; P = .02; adjuvant chemotherapy: HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.56-0.90; P = .005) and DFS (year of surgery: HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.59-0.99; P = .04; adjuvant chemotherapy: HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.57-0.92; P = .009) for patients undergoing minimally invasive vs open surgery.Conclusions and relevance:In this study of 396 patients with borderline resectable and resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma, MIPS was associated with better OS and DFS than OPS. Centralization of MIPS should be stimulated, and pancreatic surgeons should be encouraged to pass the learning curve before implementing MIPS for pancreatic adenocarcinoma in daily clinical practice.
