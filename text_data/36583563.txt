Background:Epidemiologic studies have produced conflicting results on the effects of metformin on pancreatic cancer. This study aimed to observe and analyze whether metformin use is associated with better prognosis in pancreatic cancer.Materials and Methods:In this retrospective cohort study, all baseline data were retrieved from The Chinese Medicine Information Retrieval System (https://dc.wzhospital.cn/vpn/index.html) of The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. Survival data were collected by follow-up visits and medical records. Overall survival was the primary endpoint, while progression-free survival and disease-free survival were secondary endpoints. Progression or recurrence was assessed with radiologic images.Results:Seventy-six metformin users and 92 metformin nonusers diagnosed with pancreatic cancer from 2012 to 2020 in this hospital were enrolled. The adjusted hazard ratio for overall survival for metformin users was 0.50 (95% confidence interval = 0.33-0.76), where median overall survival was 16.0 months for metformin users versus 11.5 months for metformin nonusers. The protective effect was also found by analyzing progression-free survival (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.39, 95% confidence interval = 0.18-0.86) and disease-free survival (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.30, 95% confidence interval = 0.14-0.68). In the subgroup analysis, metformin use had a statistically significant association with prolongation of survival in stage I to II pancreatic cancer patients (hazard ratio = 0.47, 95% confidence interval = 0.25-0.91), but not for advanced tumor stage (hazard ratio for IV stage = 0.62, 95% confidence interval = 0.33-1.19), after adjustment for other risk factors.Conclusion:Metformin use is related to favorable survival outcomes of pancreatic cancer, especially in early tumor stage.
