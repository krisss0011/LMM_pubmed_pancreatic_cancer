Background:Our phase II trial (FABRIC study) failed to verify the efficacy of gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin (GEMOX) in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with a familial or personal history of pancreatic, breast, ovarian or prostate cancer, which suggested that a family and personal history may be insufficient to determine response to platinum-based chemotherapy.Methods:This ancillary analysis aimed to investigate the prevalence of germline variants of homologous recombination repair (HRR)-related genes and clarify the association of germline variants with the efficacy of GEMOX and patient outcome in PDAC patients. Of 45 patients enrolled in FABRIC study, 27 patients were registered in this ancillary analysis.Results:Of the identified variants in HRR-related genes, one variant was considered pathogenic and eight variants in six patients (22%) were variants of unknown significance (VUS). Objective response to GEMOX was achieved by 43% of the seven patients and tended to be higher than that of patients without such variants (25%). Pathogenic/VUS variant in HRR-related genes was an independent favorable factor for progression-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.322; P = 0.047) and overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.195; P = 0.023) in multivariable analysis.Conclusions:The prevalence of germline variants in PDAC patients was very low even among patients with a familial/personal history of pancreatic, breast, ovarian or prostate cancer. Patients with one or more germline variants in HRR-related genes classified as pathogenic or VUS may have the potential to obtain better response to GEMOX and have better outcomes.
