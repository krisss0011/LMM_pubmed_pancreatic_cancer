Objective:In this article, we aimed to report the incidence rate of PC at the national and regional levels of Iran from 2014 to 2017 for the first time based on the IARC protocols.Methods:The data was recruited from the Iranian national program of cancer registry, a national cancer registry program reformed in 2014 after including cancer diagnosis based on clinical judgment and death certificates. This registry includes data from the pathology laboratories and clinical sectors included with death certificates from 60 medical universities in 31 provinces of Iran. Age-standardized incidence rates were calculated at the national and regional levels.Results:From 2014 to 2017, 8851 new cases (males=60.46%) were diagnosed, with a mean age of 66.2 Â± 19.6. Forty-one percent of the patients were diagnosed by microscopic verification, and 51% were diagnosed based on clinical judgment without microscopic verification and death certificates. The age-standardized incidence rate was measured as 3.45 per 100,000 in 2017, with the highest rates in individuals older than 85 (30.91 per 100,000), and the provinces of Qom, Tehran, and Isfahan recorded the highest incidence rates with 3.87, 3.85, and 3.66 per 100,000 respectively.Conclusions:PC incidence in Iran is still lower than in western countries. However, the incidence from 2014 to 2017 is higher than previous national and regional reports and should not be overlooked. Improvement in the national cancer registry program and documentation may be reasons for this difference.
