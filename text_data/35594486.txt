The classification and management of solid pancreatic neoplasms has expanded significantly in recent years because of advances in immunohistochemical markers, molecular diagnostics, and therapeutics. Solid pancreatic masses are subdivided into 1) ill-defined, scirrhous, and stroma-rich (ductal adenocarcinoma) and 2) well circumscribed, cellular, and stroma-poor (including neuroendocrine neoplasms, acinar cell carcinoma, pancreatoblastoma, and solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm). Definitive diagnosis, particularly of stroma-poor, circumscribed tumors, requires the incorporation of radiologic and cytologic findings, along with the judicious use of (broad, but limited) immunohistochemical panels (pancytokeratin and neuroendocrine [synaptophysin], acinar [trypsin], and solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm [Î²-catenin] markers), along with unstained slides. Depending on the initial results, immunohistochemical panels should be expanded to include more confirmatory (acinar and neuroendocrine) markers. This ensures that adequate material is available for definitive diagnosis/subclassification and, in some cases, grading, and/or molecular studies, particularly of grade 3 neuroendocrine neoplasms and mixed-lineage tumors. The objective of this review is to expand the understanding of the cytomorphology of solid pancreatic neoplasms using an integrated, multidisciplinary approach in their diagnosis. Knowledge and understanding of recent updates in the classification of solid pancreatic neoplasms ensures that cytopathologists appropriately triage specimens, judiciously use and interpret ancillary studies, and incorporate these results in reporting.
