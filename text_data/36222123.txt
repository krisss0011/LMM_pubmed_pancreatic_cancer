The efficacy of conventional treatments for pancreatic cancer remains unsatisfactory, and immunotherapy is an emerging option for adjuvant treatment of this highly deadly disorder. The tumor-associated antigen (TAA) MUC1 is expressed in a variety of human cancers and is overexpressed in more than 90% of pancreatic cancer, which makes it an attractive target for cancer immunotherapy. As a self-protein, MUC1 shows a low immunogenicity because of immune tolerance, and the most effective approach to breaking immune tolerance is alteration of the antigen structure. In this study, the altered MUC11068-1076Y1epitope (YLQRDISEM) by modification of amino acid residues in sequences presented a higher immunogenicity and elicited more CTLs relative to the wild-type (WT) MUC11068-1076epitope (ELQRDISEM). In addition, the altered MUC11068-1076Y1epitope was found to cross-recognize pancreatic cancer cells expressing WT MUC1 peptides in an HLA-A0201-restricted manner and trigger stronger immune responses against pancreatic cancer via the perforin/granzyme apoptosis pathway. As a potential HLA-A0201-restricted CTL epitope, the altered MUC11068-1076Y1epitope is considered as a promising target for immunotherapy of pancreatic cancer. Alteration of epitope residues may be feasible to solve the problem of the low immunogenicity of TAA and break immune tolerance to induce immune responses against human cancers.
