The successful application of antibody-based therapeutics in either primary or metastatic cancer depends upon the selection of rare cell surface epitopes that distinguish cancer cells from surrounding normal epithelial cells. By contrast, as circulating tumor cells (CTCs) transit through the bloodstream, they are surrounded by hematopoietic cells with dramatically distinct cell surface proteins, greatly expanding the number of targetable epitopes. Here, we show that an antibody (23C6) against cadherin proteins effectively suppresses blood-borne metastasis in mouse isogenic and xenograft models of triple negative breast and pancreatic cancers. The 23C6 antibody is remarkable in that it recognizes both the epithelial E-cadherin (CDH1) and mesenchymal OB-cadherin (CDH11), thus overcoming considerable heterogeneity across tumor cells. Despite its efficacy against single cells in circulation, the antibody does not suppress primary tumor formation, nor does it elicit detectable toxicity in normal epithelial organs, where cadherins may be engaged within intercellular junctions and hence inaccessible for antibody binding. Antibody-mediated suppression of metastasis is comparable in matched immunocompetent and immunodeficient mouse models. Together, these studies raise the possibility of antibody targeting CTCs within the vasculature, thereby suppressing blood-borne metastasis.
