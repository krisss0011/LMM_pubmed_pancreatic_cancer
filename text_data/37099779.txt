Objectives:Racial-ethnic disparities in pain management are common but not known among pancreatic disease patients. We sought to evaluate racial-ethnic disparities in opioid prescriptions for pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer patients.Methods:Data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey were used to examine racial-ethnic and sex differences in opioid prescriptions for ambulatory visits by adult pancreatic disease patients.Results:We identified 207 pancreatitis and 196 pancreatic cancer patient visits, representing 9.8 million visits, but weights were repealed for analysis. No sex differences in opioid prescriptions were found among pancreatitis (P = 0.78) or pancreatic cancer patient visits (P = 0.57). Opioids were prescribed at 58% of Black, 37% of White, and 19% of Hispanic pancreatitis patient visits (P = 0.05). Opioid prescriptions were less common in Hispanic versus non-Hispanic pancreatitis patients (odds ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.91; P = 0.03). We found no racial-ethnic differences in opioid prescriptions among pancreatic cancer patient visits.Conclusions:Racial-ethnic disparities in opioid prescriptions were observed in pancreatitis, but not pancreatic cancer patient visits, suggesting possible racial-ethnic bias in opioid prescription practices for patients with benign pancreatic disease. However, there is a lower threshold for opioid provision in the treatment of malignant, terminal disease.
