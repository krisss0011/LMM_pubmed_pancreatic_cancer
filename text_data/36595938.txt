Orthotopic patient-derived xenograft models recapitulate the genomic complexity of the original tumor and some aspects of local microenvironment, useful for rapid development and validation of personalized treatment strategies. Here, we precisely describe a protocol for generating tumor slices from human or murine-derived pancreatic cancer. They are then implanted directly into the murine pancreas, monitored using ultrasound, with a 90% success rate. This assay creates a clinically relevant in vivo model facilitating personalized treatment development.
