Pancreatic cancer is a highly lethal cancer characterized by local invasiveness, early metastasis, recurrence and high resistance to current therapies. Extensive stroma or desmoplasia is a key histological feature of the disease, and interactions between cancer and stromal cells are critical for pancreatic cancer development and progression. Mesenchymal stromal cells [MSCs] exhibit preferential tropism to primary and metastatic tumor sites and may either suppress or support tumor growth. Although MSCs represent a potential source of pancreatic cancer stroma, their contribution to pancreatic tumor growth remains poorly known. Here, we show that bone marrow MSCs significantly contribute to pancreatic cancer growth in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, MSCs create a pro-carcinogenic microenvironment through the release of key factors mediating growth and angiogenesis, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, vascular endothelial growth factor and activation of STAT3 signaling in tumor cells. IL-6 released by MSCs was largely responsible for the pro-tumorigenic effects of MSCs. Knockdown of IL-6 expression in MSCs by small interfering RNA (siRNA) abolished the MSC growth-promoting effect in vitro, reducing tumor cell proliferation and clonogenic potential. In addition, in a heterotopic nude mouse model of human pancreatic tumor xenografts, blockade of IL-6 with the anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, tocilizumab, or of its downstream effector STAT3 with the small molecule STAT3 inhibitor S3I-201, abrogated MSC-mediated tumor promotion and delayed tumor formation significantly. Our data demonstrate that MSCs promote pancreatic cancer growth, with IL-6 produced by MSCs playing a pivotal role.
