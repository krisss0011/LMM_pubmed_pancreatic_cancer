BACKGROUND: Liver resection and local ablation are the only curative treatment 
for non-cirrhotic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Few data exist concerning the 
prognosis of patients resected for non-cirrhotic HCC. The objectives of this 
study were to determine the prognostic factors of recurrence-free survival (RFS) 
and overall survival (OS) and to develop a prognostication algorithm for 
non-cirrhotic HCC.
METHODS: French multicenter retrospective study including HCC patients with 
non-cirrhotic liver without underlying viral hepatitis: F0, F1 or F2 fibrosis.
RESULTS: A total of 467 patients were included in 11 centers from 2010 to 2018. 
Non-cirrhotic liver had a fibrosis score of F0 (n=237, 50.7%), F1 (n=127, 27.2%) 
or F2 (n=103, 22.1%). OS and RFS at 5 years were 59.2% and 34.5%, respectively. 
In multivariate analysis, microvascular invasion and HCC differentiation were 
prognostic factors of OS and RFS and the number and size were prognostic factors 
of RFS (P<0.005). Stratification based on RFS provided an algorithm based on 
size (P=0.013) and number (P<0.001): 2 HCC with the largest nodule ≤10 cm 
(n=271, Group 1); 2 HCC with a nodule >10 cm (n=176, Group 2); >2 HCC regardless 
of size (n=20, Group 3). The 5-year RFS rates were 52.7% (Group 1), 30.1% (Group 
2) and 5% (Group 3).
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a prognostication algorithm based on the number (≤ or 
>2) and size (≤ or >10 cm), which could be used as a treatment decision support 
concerning the need for perioperative therapy. In case of bifocal HCC, surgery 
should not be a contraindication.
