Purpose:To assess the preclinical efficacy, clinical safety and efficacy, and MTD of palbociclib plus nab-paclitaxel in patients with advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).Experimental design:Preclinical activity was tested in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of PDAC. In the open-label, phase I clinical study, the dose-escalation cohort received oral palbociclib initially at 75 mg/day (range, 50‒125 mg/day; modified 3+3 design; 3/1 schedule); intravenous nab-paclitaxel was administered weekly for 3 weeks/28-day cycle at 100‒125 mg/m2. The modified dose-regimen cohorts received palbociclib 75 mg/day (3/1 schedule or continuously) plus nab-paclitaxel (biweekly 125 or 100 mg/m2, respectively). The prespecified efficacy threshold was 12-month survival probability of ≥65% at the MTD.Results:Palbociclib plus nab-paclitaxel was more effective than gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel in three of four PDX models tested; the combination was not inferior to paclitaxel plus gemcitabine. In the clinical trial, 76 patients (80% received prior treatment for advanced disease) were enrolled. Four dose-limiting toxicities were observed [mucositis (n= 1), neutropenia (n= 2), febrile neutropenia (n= 1)]. The MTD was palbociclib 100 mg for 21 of every 28 days and nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m2weekly for 3 weeks in a 28-day cycle. Among all patients, the most common all-causality any-grade adverse events were neutropenia (76.3%), asthenia/fatigue (52.6%), nausea (42.1%), and anemia (40.8%). At the MTD (n= 27), the 12-month survival probability was 50% (95% confidence interval, 29.9-67.2).Conclusions:This study showed the tolerability and antitumor activity of palbociclib plus nab-paclitaxel treatment in patients with PDAC; however, the prespecified efficacy threshold was not met.Trial registration:Pfizer Inc (NCT02501902).Significance:In this article, the combination of palbociclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, and nab-paclitaxel in advanced pancreatic cancer evaluates an important drug combination using translational science. In addition, the work presented combines preclinical and clinical data along with pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessments to find alternative treatments for this patient population.
