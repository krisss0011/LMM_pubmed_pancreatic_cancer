Online resources such as YouTube® can serve as the go-to resource for patients and their caregivers after a life-changing diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. There is a need to analyze the content and educational value of these videos for patients with pancreatic cancer. The top 100 most viewed videos on pancreatic cancer on YouTube® were assessed and data were collected on various variables such as views, likes, dislikes, and comments. Videos categorized as patient educational videos were further analyzed for their content, source, and educational value. Videos uploaded by patients were the most discussed (p = 0.014) and liked (p = 0.0028) videos on YouTube®. The content of the videos (personal experience, advertisement, patient education, medical professional education, alternative treatments, and increased pancreatic cancer awareness) varied depending on the uploader (patients, healthcare providers, professional societies, media) of the videos (p = 0.0007). Patient education videos were poor in being comprehensive on their education of pancreatic cancer based on our rubric (mean score of 7.67 ± 2.63 of 20 possible points). The current study shows that the educational values of YouTube® videos related to pancreatic cancer remain limited. There is significant room for healthcare providers to use the platform to develop and share comprehensive videos that can be used as more effective sources of patient education.
