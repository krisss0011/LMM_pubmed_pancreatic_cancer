Background:Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has the lowest overall survival rate primarily due to the late onset of symptoms and rapid progression. Reliable and accurate tests for early detection are lacking. We aimed to develop a noninvasive test for early PDAC detection by capturing the circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) methylation signature in blood.Methods:Genome-wide methylation profiles were generated from PDAC and nonmalignant tissues and plasma. Methylation haplotype blocks (MHBs) were examined to discover de novo PDAC markers. They were combined with multiple cancer markers and screened for PDAC classification accuracy. The most accurate markers were used to develop PDACatch, a targeted methylation sequencing assay. PDACatch was applied to additional PDAC and healthy plasma cohorts to train, validate and independently test a PDAC-discriminating classifier. Finally, the classifier was compared and integrated with carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) to evaluate and maximize its accuracy and utility.Results:In total, 90 tissues and 546 plasma samples were collected from 232 PDAC patients, 25 chronic pancreatitis (CP) patients and 323 healthy controls. Among 223 PDAC cases with known stage information, 43/119/38/23 cases were of Stage I/II/III/IV. A total of 171 de novo PDAC-specific markers and 595 multicancer markers were screened for PDAC classification accuracy. The top 185 markers were included in PDACatch, from which a 56-marker classifier for PDAC plasma was trained, validated and independently tested. It achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.91 in both the validation (31 PDAC, 26 healthy; sensitivity = 84%, specificity = 89%) and independent tests (74 PDAC, 65 healthy; sensitivity = 82%, specificity = 88%). Importantly, the PDACatch classifier detected CA19-9-negative PDAC plasma at sensitivities of 75 and 100% during the validation and independent tests, respectively. It was more sensitive than CA19-9 in detecting Stage I (sensitivity = 80 and 68%, respectively) and early-stage (Stage I-IIa) PDAC (sensitivity = 76 and 70%, respectively). A combinatorial classifier integrating PDACatch and CA19-9 outperformed (AUC=0.94) either PDACatch (0.91) or CA19-9 (0.89) alone (p < 0.001).Conclusions:The PDACatch assay demonstrated high sensitivity for early PDAC plasma, providing potential utility for noninvasive detection of early PDAC and indicating the effectiveness of methylation haplotype analyses in discovering robust cancer markers.
