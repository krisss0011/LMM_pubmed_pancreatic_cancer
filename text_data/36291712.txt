Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is caused by genetic mutations in four genes: KRAS proto-oncogene and GTPase (KRAS), tumor protein P53 (TP53), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A), and mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 4 (SMAD4), also called the big 4. The changes in tumors are very complex, making their characterization in the early stages challenging. Therefore, the development of innovative therapeutic approaches is desirable. The key to overcoming PDAC is diagnosing it in the early stages. Therefore, recent studies have investigated the multifaced characteristics of PDAC, which includes cancer cell metabolism, mesenchymal cells including cancer-associated fibroblasts and immune cells, and metagenomics, which extend to characterize various biomolecules including RNAs and volatile organic compounds. Various alterations in theKRAS-dependent as well asKRAS-independent pathways are involved in the refractoriness of PDAC. The optimal combination of these new technologies is expected to help treat intractable pancreatic cancer.
