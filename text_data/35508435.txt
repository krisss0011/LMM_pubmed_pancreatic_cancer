Background:ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin-like motifs) family, a group of extracellular multifunctional enzymes, has been proven to play a pivotal role in the tumor. In pancreatic cancer, the role and mechanism of this family remain unclear. The present study aimed to figure out the hub gene of ADAMTSs and explore the exact roles in the prognosis and biological functions in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).Methods:We used several databases to analyze the ADAMTS family and then screen out the hub genes. The expression of ADAMTS12 in 106 pairs of PDAC tumors and adjacent normal tissues was examined by immunohistochemistry, and its correlations with clinical parameters were further analyzed. The impacts of ADAMTS12 on the migration of PDAC cells were predicted by gene set enrichment analysis and confirmed by transwell assays. The potential impacts of ADAMTS12 on the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were identified by database analysis and experimental proof of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blotting.Results:Our study found that ADAMTS12 was a crucial gene in PDAC, and it was highly expressed in tumor tissues when compared to that in the adjacent tissues. ADATMS12 had predictive value of a poor prognosis for PDAC. The elevation of ADAMTS12 was parallel to the progression of PDAC. Inhibition of ADAMTS12 suppressed the migration of PDAC cells and interfered with the process of EMT.Conclusions:ADAMTS12 is a crucial member of ADAMTSs in PDAC and a predictor of poor prognosis. Additionally, based on its impacts on migration and metastasis in PDAC and the relationship with EMT, ADAMTS12 plays a role of an oncogene in PDAC and may be a promising target for treatment.
