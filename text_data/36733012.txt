A 43-year-old woman with about abdominal distension was referred to our hospital for a more detailed examination. Abdominal CT showed 27 cm-sized cystic lesion with the calcification along the partition wall and a nodular hyperplasia. We suspected pancreatic pseudocyst, primary retroperitoneal tumor and we performed tumorectomy. The resected specimen had a maximum diameter of 27 cm. The histopathological diagnosis was mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of the pancreas with ovarian-type stroma. The adjuvant chemotherapy treated with gemcitabine was selected for 3 courses. She continues to do well without any recurrences 7 months later.
