Background:Epidemiological findings on dietary fat intake and risk of pancreatic cancer (PanC) are inconsistent.Objectives:This study aimed to determine the association between types of dietary fat intake and PanC.Methods:We conducted a hospital-based case-control study in 957 pathologically confirmed PanC cases and 938 cancer-free controls. Cases and controls were frequency matched by age, sex, and race. Dietary information was collected using a self-administered validated FFQ. Unconditional logistic regression models were used to estimate the ORs and 95% CIs of PanC risk by quintiles of fat intake with the lowest quintile as referent and with adjustment for other risk factors and dietary factors.Results:We observed no difference in (median) intake of total fat standardized for energy among cases versus controls. The multivariable-adjusted OR (95% CI) of the highest versus the lowest quintile of intake (ORQ5 compared with Q1) was 2.51 (1.68-3.72) for fat from animal sources and 0.41 (0.29-0.58) for fat from plant sources. Intakes of total MUFA, total PUFA, and linoleic (n-6) and long chain n-3 fatty acids were inversely associated with PanC (ORQ5 compared with Q1 and 95% CI: 0.55 [0.36-0.82], 0.59 [0.42-0.82], 0.64 [0.43-0.84], and 0.60 [0.42-0.84], respectively). Arachidonic acid (n-6) and several SFAs were positively associated with PanC.Conclusion:Although some observed associations with pancreatic cancer risk could be explained by reverse causation, the potential protective associations with intakes of largely plant-derived PUFAs and MUFAs and fish-derived long chain n-3 PUFAs warrant further prospective investigation.
