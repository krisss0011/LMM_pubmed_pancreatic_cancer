Isolated metastatic melanoma to the pancreas is a rare occurrence, representing less than 1 per cent of metastatic melanoma. This case describes the clinical presentation and course of illness of a patient who was diagnosed with a solitary metastasis to the pancreas 11 months after a clear margin resection of a pT1b, stage IB melanoma. Her melanoma metastasis was diagnosed on Endoscopic Ultrasound-Fine Needle Biopsy (EUS-FNB). This patient was found to have a concurrent myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) at the time of diagnosis. This case importantly highlights the course of a rare finding in isolated metastatic melanoma to the pancreas that may have been accelerated by the patient's immunocompromised state with concurrent MPN. A high index of suspicion must be raised in patients with abdominal symptoms and melanoma history as the therapeutic window for these patients is quite narrow.
