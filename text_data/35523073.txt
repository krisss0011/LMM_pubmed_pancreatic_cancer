Purpose:PEGylated human hyaluronidase (PEGPH20) enzymatically depletes hyaluronan, an important component of the extracellular matrix, increasing the delivery of therapeutic molecules. Combinations of chemotherapy and PEGPH20, however, have been unsuccessful in Phase III clinical trials. We hypothesize that by increasing tumor oxygenation by improving vascular patency and perfusion, PEGPH20 will also act as a radiosensitization agent.Experimental design:The effect of PEGPH20 on radiation treatment was analyzed with respect to tumor growth, survival time, p02, local blood volume, and the perfusion/permeability of blood vessels in a human pancreatic adenocarcinoma BxPC3 mouse model overexpressing hyaluronan synthase 3 (HAS3).Results:Mice overexpressing HAS3 developed fast growing, radiation resistant tumors that became rapidly more hypoxic as time progressed. Treatment with PEGPH20 increased survival times when used in combination with radiation therapy, significantly more than either radiation therapy or PEGPH20 alone. In mice that overexpressed HAS3, EPR imaging showed an increase in local pO2that could be linked to increases in perfusion/permeability and local blood volume immediately after PEGPH20 treatment. Hyperpolarized [1-13C] pyruvate suggested PEGPH20 caused a metabolic shift towards decreased glycolytic flux. These effects were confined to the mice overexpressing HAS3 - no effect of PEGPH20 on survival, radiation treatment, or pO2was seen in wild type BxPC3 tumors.Conclusions:PEGPH20 may be useful for radiosensitization of pancreatic cancer but only in the subset of tumors with substantial hyaluronan accumulation. The response of the treatment may potentially be monitored by non-invasive imaging of the hemodynamic and metabolic changes in the tumor microenvironment.
