Intraductal oncocytic papillary neoplasms (IOPNs) of the pancreatobiliary system are tumors comprising oncocytic cells, in which three types of fusion genes involving -PRKACA/-PRKACB were recently identified. IOPNs infrequently combine with other histological subtypes of pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) and intraductal papillary neoplasms of the bile duct (IPNBs). This study aimed to confirm the sensitivity/specificity of the fusion genes for IOPNs and to examine their significance in other oncocytic lesions. An RT-PCR, followed by DNA sequencing, was undertaken to examine the fusions in 18 histologically diagnosed IOPNs, including four combined IOPNs. Moreover, in two IOPN cases, invasive carcinomatous lesions were separately examined on their fusion status. Oncocytic thyroidal (n = 10), renal (n = 10), and salivary gland (n = 3) lesions and IPMNs (n = 9)/IPNBs (n = 4) with focal oncocytic changes were examined as controls. Fluorescence in situ hybridization using PRKACA break-apart probes was conducted for the combined IOPN cases. Target sequencing of KRAS exon2/3 and GNAS exon 8/9 was performed for IOPN cases. Fusions were detected in all IOPN cases including invasive lesions/none of the control cases. The fusion event was confirmed also in non-IOPN component in one of the four combined cases. Regarding mutation events, 5.6%/0% of IOPNs were KRAS-mt/GNAS-mt, respectively, and both components of combined IOPNs were all KRAS-wt/GNAS-wt. In conclusion, our study confirmed the sensitivity and specificity of these fusions for IOPNs. Here, we analyzed the roles of these fusion genes in combined IOPNs, proposing the possibility of IOPN development via IPMNs/IPNBs. Further studies with more combined cases are warranted.
