Introduction:Peritoneal metastases (PMs) following resection of pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are rare. Consequently, prevalence, risk factors, and prognosis are not well known. We reviewed our institution's experience and published literature to further characterize the scope of this phenomenon.Methods:All pancreatectomy cases (556 patients) performed at a tertiary care center between 2010 and 2020 were reviewed to identify IPMN diagnoses. Patients with adenocarcinoma not arising from IPMN, or a history of other malignancies were excluded.Results:Seventy-eight patients underwent pancreatectomy with IPMN on final pathology at our institution; 51 met inclusion criteria. Of these, there were five cases of PMs (4:1 females:males). Four had invasive carcinoma arising from IPMN and one had high-grade dysplasia at the index operation. Female sex and invasive histology were significantly associated with PM (P < 0.05). PM rates by sex were 3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.5-15) in males and 22% (95% CI: 9-45) in females. Rates by histology were 2.9% (95% CI: 0.5-15) for noninvasive IPMN, and 23.5% (95% CI: 9.5-47) for invasive carcinoma arising from IPMN. Median interval from surgery to PMs was 7 mo (range: 3-13).Conclusions:PMs following IPMN resection are rare but may be more common in patients with invasive histology. Although rare, PMs can arise in patients with noninvasive IPMNs. Further studies on pathophysiology and risk factors of PM following IPMN resection are needed and may reinforce adherence to guidelines recommending long-term surveillance.
