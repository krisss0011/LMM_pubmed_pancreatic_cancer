Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is among the deadliest of all common malignancies. Treatment is difficult and often complicated by the presence of cachexia. The clinical portrait of cachexia contributes to the poor prognosis experienced by PDAC patients and worsens therapeutic outcomes. We propose that low bone mineral density is a component of cachexia, which we explore herein through a retrospective review of all patients at our facility that underwent surgery for PDAC between 2011 and 2018 and compared to sex-, age- and comorbidity-matched control individuals. Data were abstracted from the medical record and pre-operative computed tomography scans. Muscle mass and quality were measured at the L3 level and bone mineral density was measured as the radiation attenuation of the lumbar vertebral bodies. Patients with PDAC displayed typical signs of cachexia such as weight loss and radiologically appreciable deterioration of skeletal muscle. Critically, PDAC patients had significantly lower bone mineral density than controls, with 61.2% of PDAC patients categorized as osteopenic compared to 36.8% of controls. PDAC patients classified as osteopenic had significantly reduced survival (1.01 years) compared to patients without osteopenia (2.77 years). The presence of osteopenia was the strongest clinical predictor of 1- and 2-year disease-specific mortality, increasing the risk of death by 107% and 80%, respectively. Osteopenia serves as a test of 2-year mortality with sensitivity of 76% and specificity of 58%. These data therefore identify impaired bone mineral density as a key component of cachexia and predictor of postoperative survival in patients with PDAC. The mechanisms that lead to bone wasting in tumor-bearing hosts deserve further study.
