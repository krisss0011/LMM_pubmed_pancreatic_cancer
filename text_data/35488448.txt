Endoscopic ultrasound-guided tissue acquisition (EUS-TA) currently plays a central role in the diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Although fine-needle aspiration has been the gold standard, novel biopsy needles for fine-needle biopsy (FNB) were developed to overcome its limitations, which include low tumor cellularity and the inability to retain cellular architecture. Following recent improvements in FNB needles, the pathological diagnosis has shifted from cytology to histology and now to genetic diagnosis. Genetic analysis using EUS-TA samples began with a search for the presence of K-ras mutations. However, the introduction of next-generation sequencers has dramatically changed genetic analysis and led to the gradual elucidation of the mechanism of PDAC, enabling personalized medicine by performing multiple gene analyses simultaneously. Comprehensive genomic profiling is currently applied in the clinical setting and there is an increasing need for gene analysis using EUS-TA samples. Although target genome sequencing is feasible even with cytological specimens, it can be difficult to proceed with full genetic analysis including whole-exome sequence or whole-genome sequence if the samples are too small. Genetic analysis will become highly important in determining indications for personalized medicine such as poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors or immune checkpoint inhibitors. Therefore, the endosonographer must always take gene analysis into consideration when collecting samples for diagnosis and further improvement of the puncture technique and needle development are anticipated in the future.
