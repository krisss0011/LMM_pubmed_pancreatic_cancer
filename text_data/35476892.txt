Background:Few studies have evaluated outcomes of total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) compared with single modality neoadjuvant therapy (SMNT) or surgery first (SF) for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).Methods:A single-institution retrospective review of PDAC patients who underwent pancreatectomy was conducted (1993-2019). Overall survival (OS) estimates from diagnosis and from surgery were determined using Kaplan-Meier methods; Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for covariates.Results:Surgery was performed upfront (SF) in 168 (46.9%), while 111 (31.0%) had chemotherapy or chemoradiation before resection (SMNT), and 79 (22.1%) underwent TNT (chemotherapy and chemoradiation). Resection margins were more frequently R0 in the TNT group (86.1%) compared with SMNT (64.0%) and SF (72%) (p < 0.001). Complete pathologic response was more common in the TNT group (10.1%) compared with SMNT (3.6%) or SF (0.6%) (p = 0.001), resulting in prolonged survival (median OS = 100.2 months). TNT patients demonstrated longer median OS from surgery (33.6 months) compared with SF (19.1 months) and SMNT (17.4 months) (p = 0.010), which persisted after controlling for covariates.Conclusions:TNT is associated with more frequent complete pathologic response, a higher rate of margin negative resection, and prolonged OS as compared with SF or SMNT. Additional studies to identify subgroups that derive the greatest benefit are warranted.
