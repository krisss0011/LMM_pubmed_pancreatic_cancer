Data-independent acquisition (DIA)-mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteome strategies are increasingly used for detecting and validating protein biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Here, based on an in-depth proteome analysis of seven pancreatic cancer cell lines, we built a pancreas-specific mass spectrum library containing 10633 protein groups and 184551 peptides. The proteome difference among the seven pancreatic cancer cells was significant, especially for the divergent expression of proteins related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The spectra library was applied to explore the proteome difference of PANC-1 and BxPC-3 cells upon gemcitabine (GEM) treatment, and potential GEM targets were identified. The cytotoxicity test and GEM target analysis found that HPAC, CFPAC-1, and BxPC-3 were sensitive to GEM treatment, whereas PANC-1 and AsPC-1 were resistant. Finally, we found EMT was significant for CFPAC-1, AsPC-1, and PANC-1 cells, whereas BxPC-3 and HPAC cells showed more typical epithelial features. This library provides a valuable resource for in-depth proteomic analysis on pancreatic cancer cell lines, meeting the urgent demands for cell line-dependent protein differences and targeted drug analysis.
