Background:Postoperative chemotherapy following pancreatic cancer resection is the standard of care. The utility of postoperative chemotherapy for patients who receive neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) is unclear.Methods:Patients who underwent pancreatectomy after NAT with FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine-based chemotherapy for non-metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (2015-2019) were identified. Patients who received less than 2 months of neoadjuvant chemotherapy or died within 90 days from surgery were excluded.Results:A total of 427 patients (resectable, 22.2%; borderline resectable, 37.9%; locally advanced, 39.8%) were identified with the majority (69.3%) receiving neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX. Median duration of NAT was 4.1 months. Following resection, postoperative chemotherapy was associated with an improved median overall survival (OS) (28.7 vs. 20.4 months, P = 0.006). Risk-adjusted multivariable modeling showed negative nodal status (N0), favorable pathologic response (College of American Pathologists score 0 &amp; 1), and receipt of postoperative chemotherapy to be independent predictors of improved OS. Regimen, duration, and number of cycles of NAT were not significant predictors. Thirty-four percent (60/176) of node-positive and 50.1% (126/251) of node-negative patients did not receive postoperative chemotherapy due to poor functional status, postoperative complications, and patient preference. Among patients with node-positive disease, postoperative chemotherapy was associated with improved median OS (27.2 vs. 10.5 months, P &lt; 0.001). Among node-negative patients, postoperative chemotherapy was not associated with a survival benefit (median OS, 30.9 vs. 36.9 months; P = 0.406).Conclusion:Although there is no standard NAT regimen for patients with pancreatic cancer, postoperative chemotherapy following NAT and resection appears to be associated with improved OS for patients with node-positive disease.
