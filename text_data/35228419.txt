A 67-year-old woman underwent distal pancreatectomy for pancreatic cancer. Recurrence in the form of lung metastasis was discovered eight months after surgery, and chemotherapy was initiated. Two years after the surgery, she was admitted for the evaluation of melena. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed multiple subepithelial lesions with ulceration from the gastric body to the fornix. The histopathology of biopsy specimens was consistent with ductal adenocarcinoma, which appeared similar to the resected pancreatic cancer. The patient was diagnosed with multiple gastric metastases of pancreatic cancer. We herein report a case of pancreatic cancer with multiple gastric metastases that occurred after surgery for pancreatic tail cancer.
