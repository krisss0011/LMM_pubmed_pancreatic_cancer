Introduction:The diagnosis of solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN) on fine needle aspiration specimens can be challenging because of morphological overlap with other pancreatic neoplasms, including pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour (PanNET). SRY-related high-mobility group box 11 (SOX11) is a recently described sensitive and specific marker for SPN diagnosis. However, SOX11 immunocytochemistry on cytological smears has not been reported. We evaluated the utility of SOX11 for diagnosis of SPN on cytological preparations.Methods:SOX11 immunocytochemistry was performed on Papanicolaou-stained smears and/or corresponding cell blocks from aspirates of 7 SPN and 10 PanNET cases identified between 2005 and 2020. Findings were compared with those for beta-catenin, a frequently used diagnostic marker for SPN.Results:Six smears and 6 cell blocks from SPN cases and 8 smears and 10 cell blocks from PanNET cases were available for immunostaining. For SPN, nuclear staining for SOX11 was seen in 6 of 6 (100%) smears and 5 of 6 (83%) cell blocks, with equivocal staining in 1 cell block. In contrast, 7 of 8 (88%) smears and 9 of 10 (90%) cell blocks were negative for SOX11 for PanNet, with equivocal staining seen in 1 case. Beta-catenin immunocytochemistry showed nuclear staining in 6 of 7 (86%) SPN cases and no staining in all 10 (100%) PanNET cases.Conclusions:SOX11 detected by immunocytochemistry can serve as a useful diagnostic marker for SPN, in addition to beta catenin, and can be performed on cytological smears in cases without a cell block preparation.
