Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) are major postoperative complications (POCs) following distal pancreatectomy (DP). Notably, POPF may worsen the prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer. Previously reported risks for POCs include body mass index, pancreatic texture, and albumin levels. Moreover, the C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio (CAR) is a valuable parameter for prognostication. On the other hand, POCs sometimes lead to a worse prognosis in several cancer types. Thus, we assumed that CAR could be a risk factor for POPFs. This study investigated whether CAR can predict POPF risk in patients with pancreatic cancer following DP. This retrospective study included 72 patients who underwent DP for pancreatic cancer at Ehime University between January 2009 and August 2022. All patients underwent preoperative CAR screening. Risk factors for POPF were analyzed. POPF were observed in 17 of 72 (23.6%) patients. POPF were significantly associated with a higher CAR (p = 0.001). The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis determined the cutoff value for CAR to be 0.05 (sensitivity: 76.5%, specificity: 88.9%, likelihood ratio: 6.88), indicating an increased POPF risk. Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed that CAR â‰¥ 0.05 was a statistically independent factor for POPF (p < 0.001, p = 0.013). Therefore, CAR has the potential to predict POPF following DP.
