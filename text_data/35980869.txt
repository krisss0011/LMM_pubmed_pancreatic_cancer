Preclinical data demonstrate that the gut microbiota can promote pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), but mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesized that intestinal microbiota alters anti-tumor innate immunity response to facilitate PDAC progression. Human PDAC L3.6pl cells were heterotopically implanted intoRag1-/-mice after microbiota depletion with antibiotics, while syngeneic murine PDAC Pan02 cells were implanted intrapancreatic into germ-free (GF) C57BL/6 J mice. Natural killer (NK) cells and their IFNγ expression were quantitated by flow cytometry. NK cells were depleted in vivo using anti-Asialo GM1 antibody to confirm the role of NK cells. Bacteria-free supernatant from SPF and GF mice feces was used to test its effect on NK-92MI cell anti-tumor responsein vitro. SPF and ex-GF mice (reconstituted with SPF microbiota) developed larger PDAC tumors with decreased NK cell tumor infiltration and IFNγ expression versus GF-Rag1-/-. Microbiota-induced PDAC tumorigenesis was attenuated by antibiotic exposure, a process reversed following NK cell depletion in bothRag1-/-and C57BL/6 J mice. Compared to GF, SPF-Rag1-/-abiotic stool culture supernatant inhibited NK-92MI cytotoxicity, migration, and anti-cancer related gene expression. Gut microbiota promotes PDAC tumor progression through modulation of the intratumoral infiltration and activity of NK cells.
