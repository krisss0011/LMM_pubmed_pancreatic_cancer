Background:Although improvement has been made in therapeutic strategies against pancreatic carcinoma, overall survival has not significantly enhanced over the past decade. Thus, the establishment of better therapeutic regimens remains a high priority.Methods:Pancreatic cancer cell lines were incubated with romidepsin, an inhibitor of histone deacetylase, and tamoxifen, and their effects on cell growth, signaling and gene expression were analyzed. Xenografts of human pancreatic cancer CFPAC1 cells were medicated with romidepsin and tamoxifen to evaluate their effects on tumor growth.Results:The inhibition of the growth of pancreatic cancer cells induced by romidepsin and tamoxifen was effectively reduced by N-acetyl cysteine and α-tocopherol, respectively. The combined treatment greatly induced reactive oxygen species production and mitochondrial lipid peroxidation, and these effects were prevented by N-acetyl cysteine and α-tocopherol. Tamoxifen enhanced romidepsin-induced cell senescence. FOXM1 expression was markedly downregulated in pancreatic cancer cells treated with romidepsin, and tamoxifen further reduced FOXM1 expression in cells treated with romidepsin. Siomycin A, an inhibitor of FOXM1, induced senescence in pancreatic cancer cells. Similar results were obtained in knockdown of FOXM1 expression by siRNA.Conclusion:Since FOXM1 is used as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer, a combination of the clinically available drugs romidepsin and tamoxifen might be considered for the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer.
