Aim:The first inhibitor targeting myoferlin (MYOF),WJ460, bears poor metabolic stability and water solubility. Therefore, this study aimed to improve the drug-like properties ofWJ460.Materials & methods:The authors synthesized an array of 1,5-diaryl-1,2,4-triazole analogs and appraised the binding activities with MYOF and their antiproliferative and antimigratory activities against pancreatic cancer cells.Results:Molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance results showed thatE4was directly bound to the MYOF-C2D domain.E4effectively inhibited the proliferation and migration of pancreatic cancer cellsin vitro. Anin silicostudy suggested that the water solubility ofE4was improved by about 22-times than that ofWJ460.Conclusion:The findings suggested that the druglike ability ofE4was significantly improved.
