Objective:The role of biomarkers in the early diagnosis and prognosis prediction of tumors has been paid more and more attention by researchers. Mucins are markers that have been found to have an abnormal expression in many tumors in recent years, which have been proved to have a predictive effect on the prognosis of tumors such as cholangiocarcinoma and colon cancer. However, whether it can predict the prognosis of pancreatic cancer remains unknown. The purpose of our study is to investigate whether the mucins and their subtypes are related to the prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer.Methods:We systematically searched the Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for all eligible studies on the relationship between mucin and the prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer up to November 2021. We used R 4.12 to calculate the combined risk ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). For studies that did not provide HR values, we used scientific methods to calculate their values as accurately as possible. We used fixed effect model due to low heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were used to study heterogeneity. The funnel plot and Egger test were used to test whether the publication bias existed. The trim and filling method were used to evaluate the impact of publication bias on the results of the study.Results:A total of 18 studies were included in this meta-analysis, including 4 subtypes of mucin family members and 1643 patients. There was a slight heterogeneity between studies (I2 = 24.4%, P = 0.14). Meta-analysis showed that MUC4 (HR = 2.04, 95%CI 1.21;3.45), MUC16 (HR = 2.10, 95%CI 1.31;3.37), and whole mucin (HR = 1.32, 95%CI 1.07;1.63). The expression level was negatively correlated with the prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients, MUC1 (HR = 1.09, 95%CI 0.77;1.54), MUC5 (HR = 1.03, 95%CI 0.47;2.25) The expression level was not related to the prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients.Conclusion:The meta-analysis demonstrated that the overall expression level of mucin and the expression levels of MUC4 and MUC16 were important prognostic predictors for pancreatic cancer patients. MUC1 and MUC5 had no predictive value for the prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients. Future studies should validate these and other promising biomarkers.Trial registration:PROSPERO registration number is CRD42021291962. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42021291962.
