Background and objectives:Few empiric studies evaluate the effects of regionalization on pancreatic cancer care.Methods:We queried the National Cancer Database to identify patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy for clinical stage I/II pancreatic adenocarcinoma between 2006 and 2015. Facilities were categorized by annual pancreatectomy volume. Textbook oncologic outcome was defined as a margin negative resection, appropriate lymph node assessment, no prolonged hospitalization, no 30-day readmission, no 90-day mortality, and timely receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy. Multivariable regression adjusted for comorbid disease, pathologic stage, and facility characteristics was used to evaluate the relationship between facility volume and textbook outcome.Results:Sixteen thousand six hundred and two patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy; 3566 (21.5%) had a textbook outcome. Operations performed at high volume centers increased each year (45.8% in 2006 to 64.2% in 2015, p < 0.001) as did textbook outcome rates (14.3%-26.2%, p < 0.001). Surgical volume was associated with textbook outcome. High volume centers demonstrated higher unadjusted rates of textbook outcome (25.4% vs. 11.8% p < 0.01) and increased adjusted odds of textbook outcome relative to low volume centers (odds ratio: 2.39, [2.02, 2.85], p < 0.001). Textbook outcome was associated with improved overall survival independent of volume.Conclusions:Regionalization of care for pancreaticoduodenectomy to high volume centers is ongoing and is associated with improved quality of care.
