Using CODA, a technique for three-dimensional reconstruction of large tissues, Kiemen et al. report observation of a microscopic focus of pancreatic cancer found in the vasculature of grossly normal human pancreas tissue resected adjacent to a large tumour. They use TP53 and SMAD4 staining to relate the small focus to the primary tumour. This report describes a represents a probable case of intraparenchymal metastasis of pancreatic cancer, revealing a probable cause of local recurrence.
