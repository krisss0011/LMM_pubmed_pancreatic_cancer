Introduction:The centralisation of pancreatic cancer (PC) services still varies worldwide. This study aimed to assess the impact that a centralisation has had on patients in South Wales, UK.Methods:A retrospective cohort analysis of patients in South Wales, UK, with PC prior to (2004-2009), and after (2010-2014) the formation of a specialist centre. Patients were identified using record linkage of electronic health records.Results:The overall survival (OS) of all 3413 patients with PC increased from a median (IQR) 10 weeks (3-31) to 11 weeks (4-35), p = 0.038, after centralisation. The OS of patients undergoing surgical resection or chemotherapy alone did not improve (93 weeks (39-203) vs. 90 weeks (50-95), p = 0.764 and 33 weeks (20-57) vs. 33 weeks (19-58), p = 0.793). Surgical resection and chemotherapy rates increased (6.1% vs. 9.2%, p < 0.001 and 19.7% vs. 27.0%, p < 0.001). The 30-day mortality rate trended downwards (7.2% vs. 3.6%, p = 0.186). The percentage of patients who received no treatment reduced (75.2% vs. 69.6%, p < 0.001).Conclusion:The centralisation of PC services in South Wales is associated with a small increase in OS and a larger increase in PC treatment utilisation. It is concerning that many patients still fail to receive any treatments.
