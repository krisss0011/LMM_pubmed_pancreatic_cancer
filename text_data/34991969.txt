Background:In recent trend of preoperative chemotherapy, postoperative clostridium difficile infection (CDI) might be increasing in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients. This study aimed to elucidate the inducement of postoperative CDI in the new era of preoperative chemotherapy.Methods:Eligible patients were those who received pancreaticoduodenectomy for PDAC. Patients were classified into two groups according to the presence or absence of postoperative CDI, and the independently associated factors for postoperative CDI were investigated. Additionally, eligible patients were classified using the identified associated factors, and the duration of preoperative antimicrobial administration and incidence of CDI were compared between the groups.Results:Two hundred PDAC patients were eligible for this study, and postoperative CDI was detected in 15 (7.5%) patients. Multivariate analysis revealed that preoperative biliary tract infection (BTI) and chemotherapy (Chemo) were independently associated with postoperative CDI (OR, 4.05; 95% CI, 1.25-13.1; p = 0.0200 and OR, 3.64; 95% CI, 1.14-11.6; p = 0.0209, respectively). The patients were classified into four groups according to the presence or absence of preoperative BTI and Chemo (BTI-/Chemo-, BTI-/Chemo+, BTI+/Chemo- and BTI+/Chemo + group). The median durations of preoperative antimicrobial administration were 0, 2, 8 and 15 days in each group, respectively. Postoperative CDI was detected in 3.7%, 10.0%, 10.5% and 31.3% in each group, respectively, and patients in BTI+/Chemo + group suffered CDI more frequently compared to those in BTI-/Chemo-group (p = 0.00778).Conclusions:Preoperative BTI and chemotherapy might induce postoperative CDI for PDAC patients.
