Background/objectives:Pancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death in the United States (US). However, there is paucity of data on pancreatic cancer hospitalizations in the US.Methods:We analyzed the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) to identify all hospitalizations of pancreatic cancer from 2008 to 2017. Hospitalization characteristics, adverse outcomes, and the disease burden on the US healthcare system was highlighted and further analyzed with respect to the US population. P-values â‰¤0.05 were statistically significant.Results:We noted an increase in the total number of pancreatic cancer hospitalizations from 37,123 in 2008 to 37,635 in 2017 (p < 0.0001), but a decline was noted for per million US population from 122 in 2008 to 116 in 2017. The 65-79 age group had the highest hospitalizations with an increasing trend from 41.6% in 2008 to 45.9% in 2017 (p < 0.0001). In 2008, a slight female predominance was noted (51.9 vs 48.1%, p < 0.0001); however, in 2017, a slight male predominance was observed (50.9 vs 49.1%, p < 0.0001). Whites made up a majority of the study population. Furthermore, emergent/urgent hospitalizations (50.7 vs 49.3%, p < 0.0001) were slightly more frequent than elective hospitalizations in 2017. The mean length of stay (LOS) decreased from 8.4 days in 2008 to 7 days in 2017 (p < 0.0001) and the all-cause inpatient mortality decreased from 10.1% in 2008 to 7.6% in 2017 (p < 0.0001).Conclusion:Although the total number of pancreatic cancer hospitalizations increased, there was a decline for per million US population. Additionally, mean LOS and inpatient mortality decreased between 2008 and 2017.
