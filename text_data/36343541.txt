Objective:Previous works have outlined the pivotal involvement of long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) in cancer progression, while the efficiency of LINC01234 in pancreatic cancer remained obscure. The purpose of this research is to unravel the regulatory mechanism of LINC01234 in pancreatic cancer via modulating microRNA (miR)-513a-3p and hexose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PD).Methods:Pancreatic cancer cells were cultured and clinical tissue specimens were collected. LINC01234, miR-513a-3p and H6PD levels in pancreatic cancer cells and tissues were examined. Plasmids altering LINC01234, miR-513a-3p and H6PD expression were transfected into pancreatic cancer cells to assess the change in biological behaviors of pancreatic cancer cells. The targeting relations among LINC01234, miR-513a-3p and H6PD were validated.Results:LINC01234 and H6PD levels were elevated while miR-513a-3p level was reduced in pancreatic cancer cells and tissues. LINC01234 deficiency hindered the malignant biological activities of pancreatic cancer cells. MiR-513a-3p depletion or H6PD elevation could abrogate the inhibitory effects of LINC01234 silencing on pancreatic cancer cells. LINC01234 sponged miR-513a-3p that targeted H6PD.Conclusion:The reduced LINC01234 exerts inhibitory impacts on pancreatic cancer cells via targeting miR-513a-3p to restrain H6PD level. The current study broadens the understanding of LINC01234 function and affords novel therapeutic targets for pancreatic cancer treatment.
