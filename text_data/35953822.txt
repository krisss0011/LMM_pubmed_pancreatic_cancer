Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly lethal and aggressive disease with its incidence and mortality quite discouraging. A robust prognostic signature and novel biomarkers are urgently needed for accurate stratification of the patients and optimization of clinical decision-making. Since the critical role of immune microenvironment in the progression of PC, a prognostic signature based on seven immune-related genes was established, which was validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) training set, TCGA testing set, TCGA entire set and GSE71729 set. Furthermore, S100A14 (S100 Calcium Binding Protein A14) was identified as the gene occupying the most paramount position in risk signature. According to the GSEA, CIBERSORT and ESTIMATE algorithm, S100A14 was mainly associated with lower proportion of CD8 + T cells and higher proportion of M0 macrophages in PC tissue. Meanwhile, analysis of single-cell dataset CRA001160 revealed a significant negative correlation between S100A14 expression in PC cells and CD8 + T cell infiltration, which was further confirmed by tissue microenvironment landscape imaging and machine learning-based analysis in our own PUMCH cohort. Additionally, analysis of a pan-pancreatic cancer cell line illustrated that S100A14 might inhibit CD8 + T cell activation via the upregulation of PD-L1 expression in PC cells, which was also verified by the immunohistochemical results of PUMCH cohort. Finally, tumor mutation burden analysis and immunophenoscore algorithm revealed that patients with high S100A14 expression had a higher probability of responding to immunotherapy. In conclusion, our study established an efficient immune-related prediction model and identified the potential role of S100A14 in regulating the immune microenvironment and serving as a biomarker for immunotherapy efficacy prediction.
