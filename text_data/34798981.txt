Individuals with a genetic susceptibility to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) may benefit from surveillance to increase the likelihood of early detection. Currently, candidates for surveillance are identified based on genetic test results and family history of PDAC, and surveillance is accomplished through imaging of the pancreas (endoscopic ultrasound or MRI). Novel methods that incorporate personalized risk, biomarkers, and radiomics are being investigated in an attempt to improve identification of at-risk individuals and to increase detection of precursor and early-stage lesions.
