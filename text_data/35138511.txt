Opioids are the most popular drugs for both acute and chronic pain management. The G protein-coupled mu-opioid receptor (MOR) is the therapeutic target for most clinically used opioids, including morphine. A mounting number of publications suggest a relationship between the MOR and possible cancer progression and recurrence extending to managing chronic cancer pain. In this study, we studied the possible link between opioid use and pancreatic cancer (PC) progression. We found increased MOR expression in murine and human PC cell lines, human PC-derived organoids, and in the undifferentiated or poorly differentiated areas of surgically resected PC tissues. Direct stimulation of MOR by morphine (MOR agonist) caused a significant dose-dependent increase in proliferation, invasion, and levels of stemness markers in PC cells. In a co-culture system, MOR stimulation of macrophages also resulted in increased proliferation of PC cells. MOR overexpression increased proliferation and cancer stemness, whereas knock-down of MOR followed opposite results in the PC cells. Morphine induced chemoresistance to conventional chemotherapeutic agents used for PC treatment. Overall, our results suggest that MOR is expressed in pancreatic cancer and may be involved in tumor progression and chemoresistance.
