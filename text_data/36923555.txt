Pancreatic cancer remains a disease with unmet clinical needs and inadequate diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers. In-depth characterization of the disease proteome is limited. This study thus aims to define and describe protein networks underlying pancreatic cancer and identify protein centric subtypes with clinical relevance. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics was used to identify and quantify the proteome in tumor tissue, tumor-adjacent tissue, and patient-derived xenografts (PDX)-derived cell lines from patients with pancreatic cancer, and tissues from patients with chronic pancreatitis. We identified, quantified, and characterized 11,634 proteins from 72 pancreatic tissue samples. Network focused analysis of the proteomics data led to identification of a tumor epithelium-specific module and an extracellular matrix (ECM)-associated module that discriminated pancreatic tumor tissue from both tumor adjacent tissue and pancreatitis tissue. On the basis of the ECM module, we defined an ECM-high and an ECM-low subgroup, where the ECM-high subgroup was associated with poor prognosis (median survival months: 15.3vs. 22.9 months; log-rank test,P= 0.02). The ECM-high tumors were characterized by elevated epithelial-mesenchymal transition and glycolytic activities, and low oxidative phosphorylation, E2F, and DNA repair pathway activities. This study offers novel insights into the protein network underlying pancreatic cancer opening up for proteome precision medicine development.Significance:Pancreatic cancer lacks reliable biomarkers for prognostication and treatment of patients. We analyzed the proteome of pancreatic tumors, nonmalignant tissues of the pancreas and PDX-derived cell lines, and identified proteins that discriminate between patients with good and poor survival. The proteomics data also unraveled potential novel drug targets.
