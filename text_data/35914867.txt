Objective:Pancreatic cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Poor prognosis and low survival rates have driven the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Nanosecond pulsed electric field has emerged as a novel, minimal invasive and non-thermal treatment for solid tumors. It is of great significance to study the combination therapy of nsPEF and other treatment strategies for pancreatic cancer.Methods:We developed neutrophil membrane-wrapped liposomal nanoparticles loaded with gemcitabine (NE/Lip-GEM) and investigated their use as a complementary agent for nsPEF treatment.Results:Our results showed that neutrophil-mediated delivery of liposomal-gemcitabine (NE/Lip-GEM) efficiently inhibited the growth of pancreatic tumors in mice whose has been treated with incomplete nsPEF ablation.Conclusions:The combination of nsPEF and NE/Lip-GEM may be a promising synergistic strategy for pancreatic cancer therapy.
