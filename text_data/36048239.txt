Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a lethal cancer with poor response to chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Recent studies suggest that epigenetic alterations contribute to its aggressive biology and the tumor microenvironment which render it unresponsive to immune checkpoint blockade. Here, we review our current understandings of epigenetic dysregulation in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, its effect on the tumor immune microenvironment, and the potential for epigenetic therapy to be combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors.
