Background:Preoperative chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy is a common strategy for treating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This study aimed to assess the association between the therapeutic response in PDAC and tumor blood circulation.Methods:The medical records of patients who underwent chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy prior to pancreatectomy for PDAC were reviewed. Of these, patient data that included three-phase contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) findings before treatments were used in this study. We evaluated the estimated tumor blood flow (eTBF) using CECT. According to the therapeutic histopathological response defined by the Evans classification, patients were divided into poor (grade I/IIa) and good (grade IIb/III/IV) responder groups. The variables, including eTBF, were compared between the two groups.Results:Thirty patients were enrolled in this study. Of these, 13 (43.3%) (grade IIB/III/IV: 8/4/1 patients) were categorized into the good responder group and 17 patients (56.7%) (grade I/IIA: 4/13 patients) were categorized into the poor responder group. eTBF was significantly higher in the good responder group (0.39 s-1vs. 0.32 s-1, p = 0.007). An eTBF â‰¥ 0.36 s-1was found to be an independent predictive factor for the destruction of over 50% of tumor cells (p = 0.036; odds ratio, 9.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-81.30).Conclusions:eTBF can be used to predict the therapeutic histopathological response in PDAC prior to treatment.
