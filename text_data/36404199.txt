Background:Progress of non-surgical treatments in the last decade has improved the prognosis of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (PanNEN). However, the improvement of surgery for advanced PanNEN remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the chronological changes of the clinical impact of pancreatectomy for PanNEN.Methods:Patients undergoing curative-intent pancreatectomy for PanNEN between 1991 and 2010 were categorized into the earlier period group, and those between 2011 and 2021 were into the later period group. Advanced PanNEN was defined as showing resectable synchronous liver metastases or invasion to portal venous systems or adjacent organs. The recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed among patients with non-advanced and advanced PanNENs. The independent prognostic risk factors were identified using a Cox proportional hazard model.Results:A total of 189 patients (n = 54 in the earlier period and n = 135 in the later period) were included. The proportion of advanced PanNEN increased from 15% to 30% (P = 0.027). The RFS and OS of non-advanced PanNEN were similar between the periods. Whereas, among patients with advanced PanNEN, the later period group showed improved prognosis; The 5-year RFS of the earlier period vs. the later period was 0% vs. 27%, and the 5-year OS was 38% vs. 82% (p = 0.013).Conclusions:A radical surgical treatment for advanced PanNEN has shown prognostic improvement in this decade. However, more careful perioperative examinations and possibly, additional treatments are required for PanNEN with portal vein invasion.
