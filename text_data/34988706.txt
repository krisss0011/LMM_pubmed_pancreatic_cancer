Purpose:Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most malignant cancer of the gastrointestinal system, and is associated with high rates of postoperative complications, including surgical site infections (SSIs). Perioperative oral care is an effective measure for preventing postoperative pneumonia. However, the preventive effects of perioperative oral care on SSIs have not been reported. We investigated the preventive effects of perioperative oral care on SSIs after pancreatic cancer surgery.Methods:A total of 103 patients with PDAC who underwent radical resection at Hiroshima Prefectural Hospital (2011-2018) were enrolled in this retrospective study. Of the 103 patients, 75 received perioperative oral care by dentists and dental hygienists (oral care group), whereas 28 did not (control group). Univariate and multivariate analyses with propensity score as a covariate were used to investigate the incidence and risk factors of SSIs in the oral care and control groups.Results:The incidence of SSIs was significantly lower in the oral care group than in the control group (12.0% vs. 39.3%, P = 0.004). Logistic regression analysis revealed that a soft pancreas, the surgical procedure (pancreaticoduodenectomy), blood transfusion, diabetes mellitus, and the absence of oral care intervention were risk factors for SSIs. The odds ratio for the absence of oral care intervention was 6.090 (95% confidence interval: 1.750-21.200, P = 0.004).Conclusion:Our results suggest that perioperative oral care may reduce the risk of developing SSIs after pancreatic cancer surgery. These findings need to be evaluated in future prospective studies.Trial registration:UMIN registration number: UMIN000042082; October 15, 2020, retrospectively registered.
