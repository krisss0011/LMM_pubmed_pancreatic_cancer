Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma remains an aggressive cancer with a low 5-year survival rate. Although gemcitabine has been a standard treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer, patients often develop resistance to this therapeutic. We have previously shown that treating pancreatic cancer cells in vitro with a combination of gemcitabine and the cytokine TRAIL significantly reduced both cell viability and survival. The data presented here demonstrate that this response to treatment is inhibited when cells are incubated with a conditioned medium derived from untreated cells. We show that this inhibition is specifically mediated by extracellular vesicles present in the conditioned medium, as seen by a significant decrease in apoptosis. Additionally, we further demonstrate that this effect can be reversed in the presence of GW4869, an inhibitor of exosome biogenesis and release. These results show that pancreatic cancer cell-derived extracellular vesicles can confer resistance to treatment with gemcitabine and TRAIL. The implications of these findings suggest that removal of EVs during treatment can improve the response of cells to gemcitabine and TRAIL treatment in vitro.
