Introduction:We previously developed a novel methylation assay, the combined restriction digital PCR (CORD) assay, consisting of treatment of DNA with methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes and droplet digital PCR.Methods:In this study, we assessed the diagnostic performance of serum methylated Homeobox A1 (mHOXA1) and methylated somatostatin (mSST) using the CORD assay in combination with CA19-9 for pancreatic cancer using serum samples from 82 healthy individuals, 13 patients with benign pancreatic disease, 3 patients with branched-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm, and 91 patients with pancreatic cancer.Results:For the single marker tests, sensitivity for all stages of pancreatic cancer, stage I cancer, and specificity were, respectively, 71.4%, 50.0%, and 94.9% for CA19-9; 51.6%, 68.8%, and 90.8% for mHOXA1; and 50.1%, 68.8%, and 94.9% for mSST. Those for the combined marker tests were, respectively, 86.8%, 81.3%, and 85.7% for combined mHOXA1 and CA19-9; 86.8%, 87.5%, and 89.8% for combined mSST and CA19-9; and 89.0%, 87.5%, and 85.7% for all three markers combined.Conclusion:The combination of mHOXA1 and mSST with CA19-9 appears to be useful to detect pancreatic cancer even at an early stage.
