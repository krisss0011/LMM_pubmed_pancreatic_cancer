A new sigma-2 (σ2) receptor ligand (FA4) was efficiently synthesized and evaluated for cytotoxic, proapoptotic, and antimigratory activity on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) primary cell cultures, which restrained the aggressive and chemoresistant behavior of PDAC. This compound showed relevant antiproliferative activity with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values ranging from 0.701 to 0.825 μM. The cytotoxic activity was associated with induction of apoptosis, resulting in apoptotic indexes higher than those observed after exposure to a clinically relevant concentration of the gemcitabine, the first-line drug used against PDAC. Interestingly,FA4was also able to significantly inhibit the migration rate of both PDAC-1 and PDAC-2 cells in the scratch wound-healing assay. In conclusion, our results support further studies to improve the library of thiosemicarbazones targeting the σ-2 receptor for a deeper understanding of the relationship between the biological activity of these compounds and the development of more efficient anticancer compounds against PDAC.
