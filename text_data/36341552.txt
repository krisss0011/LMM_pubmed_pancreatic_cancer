Objective:To investigate the safety and efficacy of anti-PD-1 antibodies in combination with chemotherapy in the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.Methods:The clinical data of 18 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who received anti-PD-1 antibody combined with chemotherapy were retrospectively analyzed. Safety, objective response rate, disease control rate, progression-free survival and overall survival were analyzed.Results:One patient achieved a complete response, nine patients had a partial response, five patients had stable disease and three patients had progressive disease. Progression-free survival and overall survival were shown to be significantly prolonged in both PD-L1-positive and high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) patients.Conclusion:Anti-PD-1 antibodies in combination with chemotherapy are safe and effective in the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.
