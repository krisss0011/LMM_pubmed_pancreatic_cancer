Objective:Positive resection margin indicates worse prognosis. The present study identified the independent risk factors of R1 resection in pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) and distal pancreatosplenectomy (DP) for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).Method:Consecutive patients who were operated from 1st December 2017 to 30th December 2018 were analyzed retrospectively. A standardized pathological examination with digital whole-mount slide images (DWMSIs) was utilized for evaluation of resection margin status. R1 was defined as microscopic tumor infiltration within 1 mm to the resection margin. The potential risk factors of R1 resection for PD and DP were analyzed separately by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses.Results:For the 192 patients who underwent PD, and the 87 patients who underwent DP, the R1 resection rates were 31.8% and 35.6%, respectively. Univariate analysis on risk factors of R1 resection for PD were tumor location, lymphovascular invasion, N staging, and TNM staging; while those for DP were T staging and TNM staging. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed the location of tumor in the neck and uncinate process, and N1/2 staging were independent risk factors of R1 resection for PD; while those for DP were T3 staging.Conclusions:The clarification of the risk factors of R1 resection might clearly make surgeons take reasonable decisions on surgical strategies for different surgical procedures in patients with PDAC, so as to obtain the first attempt of R0 resection.
