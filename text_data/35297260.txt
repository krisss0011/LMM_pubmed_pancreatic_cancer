A previously healthy 62-year-old female was referred to our hospital for epigastric discomfort in the previous month. Routine laboratory tests showed lipase and pancreatic isoamylase elevation. CT scan revealed an homogeneous mass arising from the pancreatic head-uncinate process in addition to multiple bilateral hypoattenuating lesions in the renal cortex and pulmonary nodules. US-guided biopsy of one of the kidney lesions was performed under the suspicion of pancreatic metastatic disease.
