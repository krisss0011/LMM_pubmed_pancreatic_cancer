Objective:Gastroentero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (GEP NETs) are a heterogeneous group of tumors with variable behaviors. Our aim was to study the baseline characteristics and outcomes of GEP-NETs and to establish the impact of tumor grade and resectability on the survival.Methods:A single center retrospective review of patients registered at SKMCH &RC Pakistan with the diagnosis of GEP-NETs was carried out from the Hospital Information System. The baseline characteristics of 134 diagnosed patients from January 2006 to August 2020 were analyzed. Overall survival (OS) and Disease Free Survival (DFS) was calculated using Kaplan-Meier curve. The impact of tumor grade and resectability was seen on the OS and DFS. Data was analyzed through SPSS version 23. Categorical parameters were computed using ChiSquare test, keeping p-value =0.05 significant.Result:A large majority had Grade 1 disease (59%) along with localized stage at presentation (73.1%) as compared to Grade 2 (23.9%) and Grade 3 (17.1%) disease with metastatic stage at presentation (26.9%). The 5 year OS according to tumor grade was, 88%, 57% and 0% in low, intermediate and high grade respectively. The 5-year OS was 94%, 79% and 43% in the completele, incomplete and in unresectable disease group, respectively.Conclusion:GEP-NETs are rare tumors with good outcomes in Grade I and II and poor outcomes in grade III Neuroendocrine Carcinomas (NEC). Tumor grade and complete surgery of the primary tumor are important predictors of response outcomes and prognosis.
