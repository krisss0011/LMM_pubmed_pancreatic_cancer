Glucagonoma syndrome is an extremely rare paraneoplastic disorder. The key presenting feature is a rash (necrolytic migratory erythema) which can easily be misdiagnosed as a primary skin disorder. Moreover, 50 to 80 % of patients already have metastatic disease at diagnosis. We report a case of a 38-year female presenting with epigastric pain and a skin rash all over the body. Workup revealed a neuroendocrine tumor (NET) of the pancreas, for which she underwent resection, resulting in a complete cure. A follow-up MRI after 8 months showed a hyperintense and arterially enhancing nodular liver lesion which did not show any uptake on the octreotide scan. However, a subsequent biopsy revealed a recurrence of the tumor. This was a unique finding in our case where a highly sensitive octreotide scan failed to identify metastasis, emphasising the importance of biopsy in such cases.
