This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the prognostic role of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Eligible studies reported differences in overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) by cfDNA status. The random effect model yielded the pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI). Detection of circulant-tumor DNA (ctDNA), KRAS mutations and other cfDNA alterations constitute detectable cfDNA biomarkers. Altogether, 38 studies (3,318 patients) were eligible. Progression-free and overall survival were decreased with detectable ctDNA (HR = 1.92, 95 %CI:(1.29,2.86); HR = 2.25, 95 %CI:(1.73,2.92)) and KRAS mutations (HR = 1.88, CI:1.22,2.92,); HR = 1.52, 95 %CI:(1.22,1.90)) respectively, across various stages. In unresectable cases, ctDNA (HR = 2.50, 95 %CI:(1.94,3.23)), but not KRAS mutations (HR = 1.16, 95 %CI:(0.46,2.94)) signaled risk for progression. Detectable cfDNA biomarkers correlated with worse prognosis in resectable cases and if detected during treatment. In conclusion, cfDNA biomarkers indicate accelerated progression and decreased survival in PDAC. Significance of KRAS mutations detection in unresectable cases is to be determined.
