Pancreatic cancer is a leading cause of death from cancer but only a minority of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas are eligible for curative resection. The increasing role of neoadjuvant therapy provides hope of improving outcomes. However, progress is also reliant on advances in imaging that can identify disease earlier and accurately assess treatment response. Computed tomography remains the cornerstone in evaluation of resectability, offering excellent spatial resolution. However, in high-risk patients, additional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography-computed tomography may further guide treatment decisions. Conventional computed tomography can be limited in its ability to determine disease response after neoadjuvant therapy. Dual-energy computed tomography and computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging perfusion studies emerging as potentially better alternatives. Combined with pioneering advances in radiomic analysis, these modalities also show promise in analysing tumour heterogeneity and thereby more accurately predicting outcomes. This article reviews these imaging techniques.
