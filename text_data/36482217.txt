Objectives:To investigate the safety and preliminary efficacy of the combined treatment of focused ultrasound (FUS) and chemotherapy (nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine, nPac/Gem) for patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer.Methods:Patients pathologically diagnosed with unresectable pancreatic cancer were included. Low (Isppa = 1.5 kW/cm2), intermediate (2.0 kW/cm2), and high (2.5 kW/cm2) FUS intensity treatment groups were predefined. A 1% duty cycle and the 3+3 scheme were used. Six combined treatments were performed, and adverse events were assessed. Changes in tumor size and tumor response, CA 19-9 level, and patient-reported outcomes at the immediate follow-up (F/U) and/or at the 3-month F/U and survival were evaluated.Results:Three participants were enrolled in each intensity group. No adverse device effect or dose-limiting toxicity occurred in any of the participants. Seven of the nine participants experienced a >15% tumor size decrease at the immediate F/U CT and at the 3-month F/U CT. The CA 19-9 level decreased in all of the participants at the immediate F/U. All participants in the intermediate-intensity treatment group showed a > 30% tumor size decrease, partial response, and a significant decrease in the CA 19-9 level at 3-month F/U and longer survival (p < 0.05).Conclusion:FUS with an intensity of 1.5 to 2.5 kW/cm2was safe in the combined treatment of FUS and nPac/Gem. Considering the results of the change in tumor size, the change in CA 19-9 level, tumor response, and survival, these FUS parameters can be used for subsequent clinical trials.Key points:• No adverse device effect or dose-limiting toxicity occurred in any of the participants when focused ultrasound with an intensity of 1.5-2.5 kW/cm2and a low duty cycle of 1% was combined with chemotherapy. • The intermediate-intensity group showed a >30% tumor size decrease, partial response, and a significant decrease in CA 19-9 in all of the participants at the 3-month follow-up and the longest survival. • Any focused ultrasound setting used in this study could be safe and optimal for subsequent clinical trials.
