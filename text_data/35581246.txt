Few studies have evaluated the impact of risk factors such as performance status (PS) and comorbidities on overall survival (OS) in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer (mPC). We investigated the influence of comorbidity, PS and age on nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine (NabGem) effectiveness profile in naive patients with mPC. 153 patients with mPC treated with NabGem upfront was divided in three groups (score 0 to 3) based on the absence or the presence of one or more risk factors among: age ≥ 70 years, PS 1 and comorbidities and the clinical outcomes was compared. Fifty-five patients were elderly (≥ 70 years), 80 patients have PS 1, whereas the other have PS 0. Patients with no risk factors (score 0) had an overall survival higher (20 months) than patients with one or two risk factors (score 1-2) (OS 11 months) and with three risk factors (score 3) (OS 8 months) (p < 0.01). The difference in OS was also statistically significant in patients without comorbidities (OS 15 months) compared to those with ≥ 1 comorbidity (OS 10 months) (p < 0.001). NabGem chemotherapy represent an effective treatment in naive patients. Age, PS, and comorbidities were prognostic factors in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.
