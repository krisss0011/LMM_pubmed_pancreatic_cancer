A 77-year-old woman who had undergone laparoscopic pylorus-preserving gastrectomy for gastric cancer showed dilatation of the main pancreatic duct in the distal pancreas on ultrasonography during postoperative surveillance. Detailed examination revealed that she had a main-duct type intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm with high-risk stigmata. As invasive malignancy was not suggested, laparoscopic splenic vessel-preserving distal pancreatectomy was performed to preserve the remnant stomach. Although adhesions around the gastroduodenostomy and splenic artery were severe, the magnified laparoscopic view facilitated the identification of appropriate dissection layers, resulting in limited blood loss. The distal pancreas was successfully resected without sacrificing blood flow to the remnant stomach. The postoperative course was uneventful. The pathological diagnosis was low-grade intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm. Laparoscopic splenic vessel-preserving distal pancreatectomy for benign or low-grade malignant disease of the distal pancreas can be useful for preserving the remnant stomach in patients with a history of gastrectomy.
