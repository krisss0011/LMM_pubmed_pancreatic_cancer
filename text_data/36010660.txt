Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a major role in the progression and drug resistance of pancreatic cancer. Recent studies suggest that CAFs exhibit functional heterogeneity and distinct transcriptomic signatures in pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic fibroblasts also form an integral component in pancreatic diseases such as chronic pancreatitis named disease-associated fibroblasts (DAFs). However, intra-tumoral heterogeneity of CAFs in pancreatic cancer patients and their pivotal role in cancer-related mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Further, it has not been elucidated whether CAF subtypes identified in pancreatic cancer also exist in chronic pancreatitis. In this study, we used primary isolated fibroblasts from pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis patients using the outgrowth method. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed, and bioinformatics analysis identified highly variable genes, including factors associated with overall survival of pancreatic cancer patients. The majority of highly variable genes are involved in the cell cycle. Instead of previously classified myofibroblastic (myCAFs), inflammatory (iCAFs), and antigen-presenting (ap) CAFs, we identified a myCAFs-like subtype in all cases. Most interestingly, after cell cycle regression, we observed 135 highly variable genes commonly identified in chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer patients. This study is the first to conduct scRNAseq and bioinformatics analyses to compare CAFs/DAFs from both chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer patients. Further studies are required to select and identify stromal factors in DAFs from chronic pancreatitis cases, which are commonly expressed also in CAFs potentially contributing to pancreatic cancer development.
