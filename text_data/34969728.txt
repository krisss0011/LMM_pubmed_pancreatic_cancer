Background/aim:The potential benefits of pancreatectomy with major arterial resection have been studied in the past, but findings remain controversial. Pancreatic neck/body cancer (PNBC) involving arteries frequently requires combined resection of the pancreas, artery and portal vein.Patients and methods:Nine prospectively-registered consecutive patients with PNBC were enrolled, all underwent pancreatoduodenectomy with common hepatic artery en-bloc resection (PD-CHAR). We investigated the safety of PD-CHAR by blood flow evaluation with intraoperative indocyanine green fluorescence imaging in reconstructed vessels/organs.Results:Among patients who underwent PD-CHAR, there was no severe morbidity. Artery/portal vein combined resection and reconstruction was performed in all patients. Four (44%) patients had pathological positivity for cancer cell invasion into the nerve plexus of artery at the site of radiographic artery involvement, although one (11%) was diagnosed with pathological artery involvement.Conclusion:PD-CHAR following neoadjuvant therapy might be feasible for PNBC without severe postoperative complications. Survival benefits in PNBC should be confirmed in further studies.
