Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a fatal malignant tumor whose effective treatment has not been found. The redox state and proliferative activity of PDAC cells are maintained by the conversion of aspartic acid in the cytoplasm into oxaloacetate though aspartate aminotransferase 1 (GOT1). Therefore, GOT1 inhibitors as a potential approach for treating PDAC have attracted more attention of researchers. Ziprasidone effectively inhibited GOT1 in a non-competitive manner. The potential cytotoxicity and anti-proliferation effects of ziprasidone against PDAC cells in vitro and in vivo were evaluated. Ziprasidone can induce glutamine metabolism disorder and redox state imbalance of PDAC cells by targeting GOT1, thereby inhibiting proliferation, preventing migration, and inducing apoptosis. Ziprasidone displayed significant in vivo antitumor efficacy in SW1990 cell-derived xenografts. What's more, knockdown of GOT1 in SW1990 reduced the anti-proliferative effects of ziprasidone. As a novel GOT1 inhibitor, ziprasidone may be a lead compound for the treatment of PDAC. KEY MESSAGES: Small molecule inhibitors targeting GOT1 may provide a therapeutic target in PDAC. Ziprasidone effectively inhibited GOT1 enzyme in a non-competitive manner. Ziprasidone repressed glutamine metabolism and inhibited the growth of tumor in vivo. Knockdown of GOT1 decreased the anti-proliferative effects of ziprasidone.
