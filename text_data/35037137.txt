Backgrounds:Pancreatic juice (PJ) is directly associated with pancreatic lesions, including pancreatic ductal cancer and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm-derived cancer. Therefore, EVs secreted from these lesions into PJ can be promising biomarkers for early diagnosis. However, there are limited data from analysis of EVs in PJ samples.Aims and methods:We aimed to determine the stability of EVs in PJ collected using endoscopic naso-pancreatic drainage (ENPD) tubes as well as catheter during endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERCP), with or without the impact of positive protease activity, and optimize the EV isolation method.Results:Size exclusion chromatography was found to be an optimal isolation method for EVs in PJ as it achieved higher recovery and purity of EVs compared with differential ultracentrifugation and polymer-based precipitation. Approximately 40% of the PJ samples collected during ERCP and more than 90% of those collected using ENPD tubes had positive protease activity. In vitro exposure to room temperature for less than 3 h was harmless to the structure of double-membrane EVs in PJ and the expression levels of TSG101, even with positive protease activity.Conclusions:We clarified the physiobiological status of EVs in PJ and optimized the EV isolation method using suitable PJ samples; these findings can be utilized to discover biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and elucidate their function.
