Background:Pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) and total pancreatectomy (TP) are two surgical methods to treat patients with pancreatic head adenocarcinoma (PHAC). However, the oncologic outcomes of TP for PHAC remain controversial. In this study, we compared early mortality and long-term survival patients undergoing TP and those with PD.Methods:All patients diagnosed with non-metastatic PHAC who underwent PD or TP from 1988 to 2016 were retrieved from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to balance the inter-group covariates. Cancer-specific survival (CSS) was the primary endpoint.Results:A total of 4748 patients (743 TP and 4005 PD) were included in the study. Some 740 patients who underwent TP were matched with 1479 who had PD. After PSM, there was no difference between TP and PD groups regarding 30-day mortality (3.5% vs. 2.7%, p = 0.290) and 90-day mortality (9.9% vs. 8%, p = 0.135). More importantly, TP showed comparable survival in comparison to PD, prior or after excluding patients who died within 30 and 90 days. Besides, multivariate analysis revealed that tumor size, tumor stage, N stage, chemotherapy, and radiation were significant prognostic factors.Conclusion:PD and TP have similar early mortality and long-term survival for patients with PHAC. In selected patients, TP can be used when oncologically appropriate.
