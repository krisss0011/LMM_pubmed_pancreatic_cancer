Background:Pancreatic cancer (PC) has an extremely high mortality rate, where obstructive jaundice due to cholestasis is a classic symptom. Conjugated bile acids (CBAs) such as taurocholic acid (TCA) have been reported to activate both the ERK1/2 and AKT signaling pathways via S1P receptor 2 (S1PR2) and promote growth of cholangiocarcinoma. Thus, we hypothesize that CBAs, which accumulate in cholestasis, accelerate PC progression via S1PR2.Methods:Murine Panc02-luc and human AsPC-1, MIA PaCa2, and BxPC-3 cells were treated with TCA, S1PR2 agonist CYM5520, S1PR2 antagonist JTE-013, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), and functional S1P receptor antagonist (except S1PR2) FTY720. Bile duct ligation (BDL) was performed on liver implantation or intraperitoneal injection of Panc02-luc cells.Results:Panc02-luc and AsPC-1 cells predominantly expressed S1PR2, and their growth and migration were stimulated by TCA or CYM5520 in dose-dependent manner, which was blocked by JTE-013. This finding was not seen in PC cell lines expressing other S1P receptors than S1PR2. Panc02-luc growth stimulation by S1P was not blocked by FTY720. BDL significantly increased PC liver metastasis compared with sham. PC peritoneal carcinomatosis was significantly worsened by BDL, confirmed by number of nodules, tumor weight, bioluminescence, Ki-67 stain, ascites, and worse survival compared with sham. CYM5520 significantly worsened PC carcinomatosis, whereas treatment with anti-S1P antibody or FTY720 also worsened progression.Conclusions:CBAs accelerated growth of S1PR2 predominant PC both in vitro and in vivo. This finding implicates S1PR2 as a potential therapeutic target in metastatic S1PR2 predominant pancreatic cancer.
