Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a challenging neoplastic disease, mainly due to the development of resistance to radio- and chemotherapy. Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) is an alternative technology that can eliminate cancer cells through oxidative damage, as shown in vitro, in ovo, and in vivo. However, how CAP affects the pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), key players in the invasion and metastasis of PDAC, is poorly understood. This study aims to determine the effect of an anti-PDAC CAP treatment on PSCs tissue developed in ovo using mono- and co-cultures of RLT-PSC (PSCs) and Mia PaCa-2 cells (PDAC). We measured tissue reduction upon CAP treatment and mRNA expression of PSC activation markers and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling factors via qRT-PCR. Protein expression of selected markers was confirmed via immunohistochemistry. CAP inhibited growth in Mia PaCa-2 and co-cultured tissue, but its effectiveness was reduced in the latter, which correlates with reduced ki67 levels. CAP did not alter the mRNA expression of PSC activation and ECM remodelling markers. No changes in MMP2 and MMP9 expression were observed in RLT-PSCs, but small changes were observed in Mia PaCa-2 cells. Our findings support the ability of CAP to eliminate PDAC cells, without altering the PSCs.
