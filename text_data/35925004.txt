Oleanolic acid (OA) and its derivatives show potent anticancer function. Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the fourth core motive of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been implicated in PC and has been validated as a therapeutic target. Our study demonstrated that K73-03, an OA derivative, was identified as a potent inhibitor of EGFR by using reverse pharmacophore screening and molecular dynamics simulation assays. Moreover, Western blot analysis showed that K73-03 markedly suppressed the levels of phosphorylated-EGFR (p-EGFR) and phosphorylated-Akt (p-Akt). The inhibitory effect of K73-03 on PC cells was assessed in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, K73-03 effectively inhibited the cell proliferation of PC cells, and induced apoptosis and autophagy of ASPC-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, pretreatment with chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor, significantly inhibited K73-03-induced autophagy and enhanced K73-03-induced apoptotic cell death. K73-03 also strongly repressed ASPC-1 cells xenograft growth in vivo. Thus, all these findings provided new clues about OA analog K73-03 as an effective anticancer agent targeted EGFR against ASPC-1 cells, it is worth further evaluation in the future.
