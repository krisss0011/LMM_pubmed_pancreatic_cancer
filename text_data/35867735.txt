The role of autophagy in cancer is complex. Both tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressive effects are reported, with tumor type, stage and specific genetic lesions dictating the role. This calls for analysis in models that best recapitulate each tumor type, from initiation to metastatic disease, to specifically understand the contribution of autophagy in each context. Here, we report the effects of deleting the essential autophagy geneAtg7in a model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), in which mutantKrasG12Dand mutantTrp53172Hare induced in adult tissue leading to metastatic PDAC. This revealed thatAtg7loss in the presence ofKrasG12D/+andTrp53172H/+was tumor promoting, similar to previous observations in tumors driven by embryonicKrasG12D/+and deletion ofTrp53. However,Atg7hemizygosity also enhanced tumor initiation and progression, even though this did not ablate autophagy. Moreover, despite this enhanced progression, fewerAtg7hemizygous mice had metastases compared with animals wild type for this allele, indicating that ATG7 is a promoter of metastasis. We show, in addition, thatAtg7+/-tumors have comparatively lower levels of succinate, and that cells derived fromAtg7+/-tumors are also less invasive than those fromAtg7+/+tumors. This effect on invasion can be rescued by ectopic expression ofAtg7inAtg7+/-cells, without affecting the autophagic capacity of the cells, or by treatment with a cell-permeable analog of succinate. These findings therefore show that ATG7 has roles in invasion and metastasis that are not related to the role of the protein in the regulation of autophagy.
