Objective:To analyze the clinical characteristics of patients with pancreatic cancer (PC) and diabetes and to explore the impact of diabetes duration, weight loss, and hypoglycemic drugs on the tumor biological behavior of PC.Methods:This is a retrospective study on patients with PC and diabetes. Subjects were grouped according to the onset age of PC, distant metastasis, duration of diabetes, degree of weight loss (âˆ†Wt), and type of hypoglycemic drugs. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between diabetes duration, weight loss, hypoglycemic drugs, and early-onset PC, distant metastasis.Results:Compared with late-onset PC, patients with early-onset PC had a higher proportion of new-onset DM (35 [79.5%] vs. 217 [46.9%], p < 0.001), smoker, drinker, and more obvious weight loss (8.5 [3.8, 15] kg vs. 5 [0, 10] kg, p < 0.001). Patients with remote metastasis had an earlier diagnosis age, heavier weight loss, lower body mass index, and were more likely to be smokers but had cancer less likely to be localized in the head of pancreas. Regression analysis showed that new-onset diabetes and weight loss were independently correlated to early-onset PC: odds ratio (OR) = 3.38 (95% CI 1.36-8.4, p = 0.09; OR = 1.56 (95% CI 1.16-2.1), p = 0.003, respectively. In contrast, long-term diabetes, and heavy weight loss were independently associated with remote metastasis: OR = 3.38 (95% CI 1.36-8.4, p = 0.09; OR = 1.56 (95% CI 1.16-2.1), p = 0.003, respectively.Conclusion:New-onset diabetes and weight loss were common presentation and risk factors of early-onset PC, which required more attention. Long-term diabetes and heavy weight loss were risk factors contributing to distant metastases, indicating potential risk factors contributing to the adverse prognosis of patients with PC.
