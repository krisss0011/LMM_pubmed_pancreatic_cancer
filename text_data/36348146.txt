Radiation therapy for cancer using the Bragg peak of an ion beam has been making steady progress after being proposed by Robert Wilson in 1946. At the end of 2020, 12 dedicated treatment devices existed in operation worldwide, and approximately 40,000 patients have been treated with ion beams (mostly carbon ions). To date, ion beam therapy is superior to other treatments for rare cancers in the head and neck as well as bone and soft tissues; however, most recently, evidence submitted in Japan for the 2022 revision of public health insurance shows that ion beam therapy outperforms photon therapy for intractable common cancers such as pancreatic cancer and liver cancer. This may greatly expand its indications. Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in the United States started research of ion beam therapy, National Institute of Radiological Sciences in Japan built the first dedicated device Heavy Ion Accelerator in Chiba and started systematic clinical research, and GSI in Germany developed the scanning irradiation method and rotating gantry for the first time. This paper presents the history and future challenges of ion beam therapy in three fields: accelerator and beam delivery system, physical/biological model and treatment planning system, and clinical research. This study is divided into three parts describing the achievements and roles of the three laboratories. In Part 1, accelerator and beam delivery system are described.
