Background:Cutaneous metastases in pancreatic cancer (PC) are rare. Herein, we evaluate the clinical, genomic, and other descriptors of patients with PC and cutaneous metastases.Methods:Institutional databases were queried, and clinical history, demographics, PC cutaneous metastasis details, and overall survival (OS) from cutaneous metastasis diagnosis were abstracted. OS was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods.Results:Forty patients were identified, and median age (Q1-Q3, IQR) of PC diagnosis was 66.0 (59.3-72.3, 12.9) years. Most patients had Stage IV disease at diagnosis (n = 26, 65%). The most common location of the primary tumor was the tail of the pancreas (n = 17, 43%). The most common cutaneous metastasis site was the abdomen (n = 31, 78%), with umbilical lesions occurring in 74% (n = 23) of abdominal lesions. The median OS (95% CI) was 11.4 months (7.0, 20.4). Twenty-three patients had umbilical metastases (58%), and 17 patients had non-umbilical metastases (43%). The median OS (95% CI) was 13.7 (7.0, 28.7) months in patients with umbilical metastases and 8.9 (4.1, Not reached) months in patients with non-umbilical metastases (p = 0.1). Sixteen of 40 (40%) patients underwent somatic testing, and findings were consistent with known profiles. Germline testing in 12 (30%) patients identified pathogenic variants in patients: CHEK2, BRCA1, and ATM.Conclusion:Cutaneous metastases from PC most frequently arise from a pancreas tail primary site and most frequently occur in the umbilicus. Cutaneous metastases may generally be categorized as umbilical or non-umbilical metastases.
