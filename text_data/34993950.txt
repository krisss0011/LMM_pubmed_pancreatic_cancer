Secondary prevention is a set of procedures involved in discovering early recurrence, local or systemic metastasis before the clinical signs or symptoms. We describe a mouse model with orthotopic pancreatic tumor implantation followed by distal pancreatectomy. The bioluminescence imaging and MRI could be used for screening the resected primary tumor recurrence and secondary cancer development. Different types of surgical procedures, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy can be engaged in reducing the metastasis potential of primary cancers. This model has been proved to be safe and easy to establish, which can mimic the clinical scenario and expand perspectives for studying the effects of tumor resection and adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy on secondary cancer prevention.
