Background:Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a malignancy worldwide. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) affects the growth of PC, nonetheless the mechanism is blurry. Here, we reconnoitered the parts of hsa_circ_0050102 in PC.Methods:Hsa_circ_0050102, microRNA-218-5p (miR-218-5p) and protein phosphatase methylesterase 1 (PPME1) abundances were indicated by quantitative RT-PCR or Western blot. Moreover, the cell functions were uncovered. Additionally, the relation of miR-218-5p and hsa_circ_0050102 or PPME1 was identified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Ultimately, the mice teats were utilized to quantity the part of hsa_circ_0050102.Results:Hsa_circ_0050102 and PPME1 contents were increased, and the miR-218-5p was dwindled in PC. Hsa_circ_0050102 lack subdued cell vitality, colony formation, cell migration and invasion, and angiogenesis, but endorsed cell apoptosis in PC cells. Furthermore, miR-218-5p was established to block the development of PC cells via PPME1. Hsa_circ_0050102 bound to miR-218-5p to adjust the content of PPME1.Conclusion:Hsa_circ_0050102 expedited the expansion of PC through growing PPME1 abundance by adjusting miR-218-5p.
