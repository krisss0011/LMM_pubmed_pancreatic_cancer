The cases of pancreatic cancer and associated deaths are increasing consistently and have become a global health concern. Prevalent intratumoral and intertumoral heterogeneity in pancreatic cancer has been revealed as an important cause of its poor prognosis. However, few precision management strategies have been formulated to treat this complex disease. There is growing evidence supporting the significance of subtyping pancreatic tumors on the basis of their molecular characteristics for improving the accuracy of clinical decision-making on treatment. Here, we summarize the current approaches to classification of pancreatic cancer, and highlight the feasibility and potential defects of their application in precision therapy.
