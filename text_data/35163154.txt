Our earlier studies showed that coupling nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with oleanolic acid derivatives increased their anti-inflammatory activity in human hepatoma cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate their effect on the signaling pathways involved in inflammation processes in human pancreatic cancer (PC) cells. Cultured PSN-1 cells were exposed for 24 h (30 µM) to OA oxime (OAO) derivatives substituted with benzyl or morpholide groups and their conjugates with indomethacin (IND) or diclofenac (DCL). The activation of NF-κB and Nrf2 was assessed by the evaluation of the translocation of their active forms into the nucleus and their binding to specific DNA sequences via the ELISA assay. The expression of NF-κB and Nrf2 target genes was evaluated by R-T PCR and Western blot analysis. The conjugation of IND or DCL with OAO derivatives increased cytotoxicity and their effect on the tested signaling pathways. The most effective compound was the DCL hybrid with OAO morpholide (4d). This compound significantly reduced the activation and expression of NF-κB and enhanced the activation and expression of Nrf2. Increased expression of Nrf2 target genes led to reduced ROS production. Moreover, MAPKs and the related pathways were also affected. Therefore, conjugate 4d deserves more comprehensive studies as a potential PC therapeutic agent.
