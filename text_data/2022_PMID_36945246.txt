A patient showed signs of fever and Hemovac insertion site discharge 8 days 
after surgery and was admitted. Abdominal paracentesis found milky ascites with 
triglyceride levels of the peritoneal fluid as high as 1,603 g/mL. Diagnosed as 
chylous ascites, symptomatic therapy such as empirical antibodies and diuretics 
was administered with paracentesis before being discharged. The ascites volume 
increased again, and the patient was re-admitted. The patient was treated with 
orlistat, octreotide, total parenteral nutrition administration, ascites 
drainage, and diuretics. Ascites levels increased further and intraperitoneal 
Viscum was administered. Clear ascites was observed, and the patient was 
discharged. We reported a case where conventional treatment for chylous ascites 
that occurred after pancreaticoduodenectomy was shown to be ineffective while 
Viscum extracted from mistletoe was able to manage chylous ascites.
