Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an increasing disease having a poor prognosis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of different models of care for pancreatic cancer in a tertiary referral centre in the period 2006-2020. Retrospective study of patients with PDAC observed from January 2006 to December 2020. The demographic and clinical data, and data regarding the imaging techniques used, preoperative staging, management, survival and multidisciplinary tumour board (MDTB) evaluation were collected and compared in three different periods characterised by different organisation of pancreatic cancer services: period A (2006-2010); period B (2011-2015) and period C (2016-2020). One thousand four hundred seven patients were analysed: 441(31.3%) in period A; 413 (29.4%) in B and 553 (39.3%) in C. The proportion of patients increased significantly, from 31.3% to 39.3% (P = 0.032). Body mass index (P = 0.033), comorbidity rate (P = 0.002) and Karnofsky performance status (P < 0.001) showed significant differences. Computed tomography scans (P < 0.001), endoscopic ultrasound (P < 0.001), fine needle aspiration, fine needle biopsy (P < 0.001), and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (P < 0.001) increased; contrast-enhanced ultrasound (P = 0.028) decreased. The cTNM was significantly different (P < 0.001). The MDTB evaluation increased significantly (P < 0.001). Up-front surgery and exploratory laparotomy decreased (P < 0.001), neoadjuvant treatment increased (P < 0.001). The present study showed the evolving knowledge in surgical oncology of pancreatic cancer at a tertiary referral centre over the time. The different models of care of pancreatic cancer, in particular the introduction of the MDTB and the institution of a pancreas unit to the decision-making process seemed to be influential.
