The Internet is a major source of patient information on medical subjects. Several studies have evaluated the content of English medical material for patient use. However, few have focused on evaluating other languages, an important gap in a growing Spanish-speaking population. The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare English and Spanish online content related to pancreatic cancer treatment. We conducted a Google web search in English and Spanish using the following terms "pancreatic cancer treatment" and "tratamiento cancer de pancreas." The first 15 educational patient-directed websites for each language were included. Two independent reviewers assessed materials for quality and understandability using the DISCERN and the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT)-validated tools. Readability was measured using two standardized tests. Wilcoxon rank sum test and unpaired Student's T-test were used for comparisons. Overall, websites in Spanish and English were understandable and had moderate to high quality. There were no significant differences in quality (p = 0.712) and understandability (p = 0.069) between languages. Readability level was significantly higher in English (p < 0.001) with content being at the university level, while Spanish was at the 12th grade level. Patient-directed online content on pancreatic cancer treatments exceeds the recommended reading level in both languages. Material is understandable with reasonable quality. Health content creators should acknowledge readability for information to be easily comprehended by those with lower health literacy.
