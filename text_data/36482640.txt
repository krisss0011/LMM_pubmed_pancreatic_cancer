Introduction:Pancreatic cancer is the seventh leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and surgical resection with radical intent remains the only potentially curative treatment option today. However, borderline resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (BR-PDAC) stand in the gray area between the resectable and unresectable disease since they are technically resectable but have a high probability of incomplete exeresis. Neoadjuvant treatment (NAT) plays an important role in ensuring resection success.Different survival prognostic factors for BR-PDAC have been well described, but evidence on the predictive factors associated with resection after NAT is scarce. This study aims to study if CA 19-9 plasmatic levels and the tumor anatomical relationship with neighboring vascular structures are prognostic factors for resection and survival (both Overall Survival and Progression-Free Survival) in patients with type A BR-PDAC.Methods:This will be a retrospective cohort study using data from type A BR-PDAC patients who received NAT in the Bellvitge University Hospital. The observation period is from January 2010 until December 2019; patients must have a minimum 12-month follow-up. Patients will be classified according to the MD Anderson Cancer Center criteria for BR-PDAC.Discussion:Patients with BR-PDAC have a high risk for a margin-positive resection. Serum Carbohydrate Antigen 19-9 plasmatic levels and vascular involvement stand out as disease-related prognostic factors.This study will provide valuable information on the prognostic factors associated with resection. We will exclude locally advanced tumors and expect this approach to provide more realistic resection rates without selecting those patients that undergo surgical exploration. However, focusing on an anatomical definition may limit the results' generalizability.
