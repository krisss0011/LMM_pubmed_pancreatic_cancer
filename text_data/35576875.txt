Objectives:It has been reported that sarcopenia is associated with higher postoperative complication rates in various surgeries and with a poorer prognosis in various carcinomas. However, many of these reports did not strictly follow the definition of sarcopenia. Therefore, we prospectively evaluated the influence of sarcopenia, as defined by the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People 2 (EWGSOP2), on complications after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) and on the prognosis of pancreatic head carcinoma.Methods:We prospectively investigated 180 patients who underwent PD at Chiba University Hospital from January 2016 to March 2020. The skeletal muscle mass, grip strength, and gait speed of the patients were measured preoperatively. Sarcopenia was defined in accordance with the EWGSOP2 definition. We evaluated the frequency and severity of postoperative complications in infectious, non-infectious, and overall complications. We analyzed the prognosis of 83 patients with pancreatic head carcinoma who underwent PD.Results:There were no differences in the severity and frequency of infectious, non-infectious, and overall complications between patients with and without sarcopenia. In patients with pancreatic head carcinoma, the recurrence-free and overall survival rates were significantly lower in patients with sarcopenia than in those without sarcopenia (P = 0.017 and P = 0.011, respectively). In multivariate analysis, sarcopenia was an independent risk factor for poor recurrence-free survival and overall survival (HR, 4.48; 95% CI, 1.68-11.98; P = 0.003 and HR, 3.25; 95% CI, 1.19-8.86; P = 0.021, respectively).Conclusions:Sarcopenia, as defined by EWGSOP2, did not affect complications after PD. Sarcopenia is an important prognostic factor for surgically resected pancreatic head carcinoma.
