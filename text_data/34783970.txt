Background:Mucinous pancreatic cysts are considered premalignant and managed differently compared to benign pancreatic cystic lesions. The aim of this updated meta-analysis is to assess the diagnostic accuracy of cyst carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in differentiating between mucinous and non-mucinous pancreatic cysts.Methods:Studies comparing the diagnostic accuracy of CEA (cutoff level of 192 ng/mL) in differentiating between mucinous and non-mucinous pancreatic cysts were searched in Medline, Ovid journals, Medline nonindexed citations, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Database of Systematic Reviews. Pooled estimates of diagnostic precision were calculated using random and fixed effects models.Results:Initial search identified 526 reference articles, of these 34 relevant articles were selected and reviewed. Data were extracted from 15 studies (n = 2063) which met the inclusion criteria. The pancreatic cystic fluid CEA level at a 192 ng/mL cutoff value had pooled specificity of 88.6% (95% CI 85.9-90.9) and pooled sensitivity was found to be 60.4% (95% CI 57.7-62.9). The pooled positive likelihood ratio was 4.5 (95% CI 2.9-6.9) and the pooled negative likelihood ratio was 0.45 (95% CI 0.38-0.52). The pooled diagnostic odds ratio, the odds of having mucinous cyst with elevated CEA, was 11.4 (95% CI 6.9-18.7). The P for chi-squared heterogeneity for all the pooled accuracy estimates was > 0.10.Conclusions:This meta-analysis suggests that the cyst fluid CEA level at a 192 ng/mL cutoff value is highly specific in the diagnosis of mucinous cystic lesions with reasonable sensitivity.
