Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most lethal diseases, with a 5‑year survival rate of <9%. Perineural invasion (PNI) is a common pathological hallmark of PC and is correlated with a poor prognosis in this disease. Hyperglycemia has been shown to promote the invasion and migration of PC cells; however, the effect of hyperglycemia on the PNI of PC and its underlying mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, Western blotting was utilized to detect the expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) and nerve growth factor (NGF). Transwell and wound‑healing assays were performed to detect the influence of hyperglycemia on the invasion and migration ability of PC cells. Anin vitroPC‑dorsal root ganglion (DRG) co‑culture system and anin vivoPNI sciatic nerve‑infiltrating tumor model were used to evaluate the severity of PNI in hyperglycemic conditions. In the results, hyperglycemia promoted the invasion/migration ability and elevated the expression of NGF in PC by upregulating HIF1α. Moreover,in vitroshort‑term hyperglycemia caused little damage on the DRG axons and accelerated both the PNI of the PC and the outgrowth of the DRGs by increasing the expression of NGF via activation of HIF1α. Indeed,in vivolong‑term hyperglycemia promoted the infiltration and growth of PC, and then disrupted the function of the sciatic nerve in a HIF1α‑dependent manner. In conclusion, a high‑glucose microenvironment promotes PNI of PC via activation of HIF1α.
