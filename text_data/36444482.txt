Background and objectives:Resection of retroperitoneal sarcoma (RPS) en bloc with pancreas is challenging and controversial. This single-center retrospective study aimed to analyze the impact of pancreatic resection (PR) and its different types on short- and long-term outcomes in patients with RPS.Methods:Data from 242 consecutive patients with RPS who underwent surgical treatment at the Peking University Cancer Hospital Sarcoma Center between January 2010 and February 2021 were analyzed. Out of these, 90 patients underwent PR, including pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) in 31 and distal pancreatectomy (DP) in 59.Results:Patients in the PR group had a higher major morbidity (37.8% vs. 14.5%) and mortality (8.9% vs. 1.3%) than those in the non-PR group, with a similar 5-year overall survival (OS) rate (46.9% vs. 53.6%). Patients in the PD and DP groups had a slight difference in major morbidity (48.4% vs. 32.2%), mortality (6.4% vs. 10.2%), and 5-year OS rates (43.3% vs. 49.3%). The PR type was not an independent risk factor for major morbidity or OS.Conclusions:PR in RPS resection was associated with increased morbidity and mortality with minimal influence on survival. Patients with RPS undergoing PD and DP showed slight differences in terms of safety and OS.
