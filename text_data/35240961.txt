Background:Pancreatic cancer is mostly diagnosed in advanced stages, and treatment results are not satisfactory. L3 skeletal muscle index (SMI) has emerged as a prognostic factor in pancreatic cancer patients. We aimed to assess the association between sarcopenia and overall survival in patients with pancreatic cancer in this study.Methods:Patients who were admitted to the Department of Oncology between March 2012 and December 2019 and diagnosed with pancreatic cancer were evaluated. The computerized tomography images and laboratory parameters of a total of 115 patients were included in this retrospective singlecenter study. We defined sarcopenia as an SMI <43,56 cm²/m² for females and <56,44 cm²/m² for males using the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve in the study population. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed by using Cox-regression modelling, and survival curves were constructed by using Kaplan-Meier method.Results:70% of the patients were male, and the mean age was 64.9±9.9 years (mean ± SD). 70.6% of female patients and 67.9% of male patients were diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. The prevalence of sarcopenia in the whole patient group was 29.6%. By multivariate analysis, SMI (p=0.009) and advanced stage (p=0.003) were found as poor prognostic factors for overall survival (OS). The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was statistically significantly higher in sarcopenic patients than in nonsarcopenic patients (p=0.031).Conclusion:Patients having sarcopenia at the time of diagnosis may demonstrate poorer overall survival of pancreatic cancer, and SMI may be considered as a potential prognostic factor.
