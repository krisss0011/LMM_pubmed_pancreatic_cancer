Background:Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is a curative resection for peri-ampullary tumours associated with high rates of peri-operative mortality and morbidity. The global trend is towards the establishment of high volume centres to reduce this. Australia faces geographical and population distribution challenges. Western Australia has centralized PD to two centres and we present the results of our institution in transitioning to a high volume centre.Methods:This was a prospective database of all PDs performed at our institution from 1 January 2005 to 2 April 2020. Mortality outcomes included peri-operative, 30 day and 90 day mortality. Complications, readmission and reinterventions at 90 days were recorded. The annual volume exceeded 20 from 2015. Outcomes prior to this were compared to characterize the transition to a high volume centre.Results:One hundred and twenty eight PDs were performed in Period 1 (1 January 2005-31 December 2014) and 170 in the high volume Period 2 (1 January 2015-2 April 2020). There was a non-statistically significant reduction in 90 day mortality in Period 2 (4.69% versus 1.18%, p = 0.06). There was a reduction in clinically significant post-operative pancreatic fistulas (31.25% versus 11.76%, p < 0.05), delayed gastric emptying (39.84% versus 22.35%, p < 0.05) and transfusion requirements (56.25% versus 17.65%, p < 0.05). Severe complications (Clavien-Dindo III or greater) were reduced (30.47% versus 18.24%, p < 0.05).Conclusion:Since establishing a high volume service, there was a reduction in post-operative complications and 90 day mortality. This is in line with outcomes from international centres and demonstrates the improvements that can be made.
