Radiomics is changing the world of medicine and more specifically the world of oncology. Early diagnosis and treatment improve the prognosis of patients with cancer. After treatment, the evaluation of the response will determine future treatments. In oncology, every change in treatment means a loss of therapeutic options and this is key in pancreatic cancer. Radiomics has been developed in oncology in the early diagnosis and differential diagnosis of benign and malignant lesions, in the evaluation of response, in the prediction of possible side effects, marking the risk of recurrence, survival and prognosis of the disease. Some studies have validated its use to differentiate normal tissues from tumor tissues with high sensitivity and specificity, and to differentiate cystic lesions and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor grades with texture parameters. In addition, these parameters have been related to survival in patients with pancreatic cancer and to response to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. This review aimed to establish the current status of the use of radiomics in pancreatic cancer and future perspectives.
