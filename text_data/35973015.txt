Advanced pancreatic cancer has a poor prognosis globally. Patients often develop pancreatic exocrine insufficiency leading to malabsorption. This systematic literature review explores the impact of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) on patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Data sources include MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, Cochrane (CENTRAL), PsychINFO, and Joanna Briggs Institute databases from inception to January 14, 2022, with reference list checking on Google Scholar. Narrative synthesis was used as the eligible studies were likely to be heterogeneous and hard to compare. This synthesis approach uses 4 steps: theory development, preliminary synthesis, exploration of relationships, and assessment of the robustness of the synthesis. Four themes arose from analyzing the study outcomes including PERT education, efficacy of PERT, the patient experience, and lack of awareness regarding enzyme replacement. The included studies did not use validated tools or standardized measurements, which made it difficult to compare or draw conclusions. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy shows the potential to improve symptoms, nutrition, weight loss, and survival, but high-quality studies with standardized outcomes have not been completed. Patient and health professional education is required because there seems to be a general lack of awareness about the use of PERT in pancreatic cancer.Systematic Review Registration: PROSPERO 2020 CRD42020195986.
