Background and purpose: Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the fourth leading cause of
cancer death in both men and women. The standard of care for patients with
locally advanced PC of chemotherapy, s tereotactic radiotherapy (RT), or
chemo-radiation-therapy has shown highly variable and limited success
rates. However, three-dimensional (3D) Pancreatic tumor organoids (PTOs)
have shown promise to study tumor response to drugs, and emerging
treatments under in vitro conditions. We investigated the potential for using
3D organoids to evaluate the precise radiation and drug dose responses of in
vivo PC tumors.
Methods: PTOs were created from mouse pancreatic tumor tissues, and their
microenvironment was compared to that of in vivo tumors using
immunohistochemical and immuno ﬂuorescence staining. The organoids and
in vivo PC tumors were treated with fractionated X-ray RT, 3-bromopyruvate
(3BP) anti-tumor drug, and combination of 3BP + fractionated RT.
Results: Pancreatic tumor organoids (PTOs) exhibited a similar ﬁbrotic
microenvironment and molecular response (as seen by apoptosis biomarker
expression) as in vivo tumors. Untreated tumor organoids and in vivo tumor
both exhibited proliferative growth of 6 folds the original size after 10 days,
whereas no growth was seen for organoids and in vivo tumors treated with 8
(Gray) Gy of fractionated RT. Tumor organoids showed reduced growth rates of
3.2x and 1.8x when treated with 4 and 6 Gy fractionated RT, respectively.
Interestingly, combination of 100 µM of 3BP + 4 Gy of RT showed pronounced
growth inhibition as compared to 3-BP alone or 4 Gy of radiation alone.
Further, positive identi ﬁcation of SOX2, SOX10 and TGF bindicated presence
of cancer stem cells in tumor organoids which might have some role in
resistance to therapies in pancreatic cancer.

Introduction
Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most lethal cancer in the
United States. The current standard of care for resected patients
consists of stereotactic radiation therapy (RT), chemotherapy or
chemo-RT, and despite extensive research and development of
new treatment regimens, 5-year survival remains at < 8%.
Pancreatic cancer patients receiving RT, chemotherapy or
chemo-RT are most commonly prescribed a regimen based on
guidelines for similar tumors with similar histology and stage, as
published by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( 1–
4). These guidelines are based on large-scale phase III clinical
trials used to study and quantify overall treatment response and
outcomes for the entire population of patients with similar
tumor characteristics, with a limited role for incorporating
genetic pro ﬁling or molecular information. Variations in
tumor and normal tissue response to radiation have long been
known ( 5–8) with considerable progress over the last 10 –15
years in understanding clinical manifestations and biologic
mechanisms of both tumor response and normal tissue
toxicities (acute and late).
Several factors in ﬂuence and complicate a patient ’s
likelihood of tumor respo nse to RT or development of
associated normal tissue toxicities. These complex factors are
related to physics (total dose, dose per fraction and volume
irradiated, and dose homogeneity), combined with use of
concomitant chemotherapy and/or surgery, patient
characteristics (age, environmental factors, hemoglobin levels,
and comorbid conditions) ( 9,10). Furthermore, variations in
patient sensitivity to RT and combined chemo-RT have been
investigated, with the ﬁrst report in 1975 of ﬁbroblasts from one
patient being 3× more sensitive than those from a cohort of
normal donors ( 11). Several subsequent studies showed
differential in vitro radiosensitivity in primary cancer cell
culture ( 12–16). This has led to a large amount of research
into development of biomarkers and models that can predict
sensitivity of individual patients ’tumors to RT, chemotherapy,
and chemo-RT, including standard 2D in vitro cell survival
studies and 3D xenograft models ( 17–18).
In addition, the study and use of 3D patient-derived tumor
organoid models to study tumor response to existing andemerging treatment regimens have grown substantially in
recent years ( 19). Tumor Derived Organoids delineate more
accurate response than cancer cell lines under 2D conditions in
terms of reiterating the in vivo environment, and amenable for
easier manipulation and high throughput screening than
xenografts model that takes longer time to achieve. Thus,
development of precision medicine approach customized to
individual patients could be more promising by adapting to an
appropriate platform such as bioengineered matrix that has the
ability to reproduce patient responses to treatment ( 20). There
has also been development of ﬂoating spheroid culture model
that allowed 3-D culture of cancer cells, however this organoid
system lacked matrix attachment and showed variable growth
pattern ( 21). Matrigel based 3D culture system is routinely used
for organoid growth and manipulation, however, it lacks de ﬁned
composition and exhibits batch to batch variation ( 22).
Furthermore, hydrogels like p olyethylene glycol which are
synthetic polymers, offer excellent elasticity in the control of
their physicochemical properties ( 23), however, these hydrogels
are less biocompatible than hydrogels based on natural
materials. Recently 3D collagen-based scaffold culture system
has also been used with zebra ﬁsh model combined with the use
of patient-derived primary cultures to examine trabectedin
response in undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma which has
shown clinical promise ( 24). In recent report, collagen-based
scaffolds model has been successfully established to study
pathophysiological features of oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma and it has been used to understand drug-resistance
processes ( 25). These developments have been driven by the
limited ef ﬁcacy in translating results derived from 2D in vitro cell
cultures into positive clinical outcomes ( 26,27). While
beneﬁting from simplicity and relative ease of use, 2D cultures
lack the ability to reproduce the diversity of cellular
organization, extracellular microenvironment, and cellular
contact and signaling pathways found within the tumor ( 28–
32). Patient-derived organoid models have shown the ability to
accurately model in vivo tumors, reproducing the heterogeneous
tissue and cellular microenvironments while maintaining genetic
and phenotypic pro ﬁles of the original tumors from which they
were derived ( 27).The majority of 3D organoid studies have
focused primarily on tumor response to chemotherapy and otherShukla et al. 10.3389/fonc.2022.1072774
Frontiers in Oncology frontiersin.org 02targeted treatment agents ( 19,33). A few studies have
investigated RT and chemo-RT responses in 3D tumor
organoids derived from glioblastoma ( 34), head and neck ( 35,
36), and rectal/colorectal ( 37–39) tumors.
Although several studies have outlined the development and
use of pancreatic tumor organoids (PTO) derived from mouse or
human cells ( 28,29,40–42) and these reports have mainly
focused on the general response of PTO organoids andindividual patient sensitivity to current and emerging
chemotherapy, molecular, and immunotherapy methods. To
date, few studies have been published on the applicability of
3D organoids for modeling the response of pancreatic cancer to
RT and combined chemo-RT. Here we report on an initial
feasibility study of PTO organoids and their ability to accurately
reproduce the responses to fractionated RT and chemo-RT of
thein vivo tumors from which they were derived. PTO
organoids were created from mouse pancreatic tumors, and
the microenvironments of the PTO organoids were compared
to excised in vivo tumor tissues. Responses of the PTO organoids
were compared to the responses of in vivo tumors to treatment
with fractionated x-ray RT. In addition, to illustrate the potential
of PTO organoids to determine tumor sensitivity to multiple
treatments, the responses of the PTO organoids to 3-
bromopyruvate (3BP) and combined 3BP-RT treatments were
studied and compared PTO responses to RT alone.
Materials and methods
Subcutaneous tumor xenografts
After animal protocol approval from our institution ’sO fﬁce
of Animal Welfare Assurance (IACUC Protocol #1019006), 6 –7-
week-old C57Bl/6 mice were subcutaneously implanted with
pancreatic tumors derived from Panc2 cells in the right ﬂank. A
full description of the subcutaneous tumor generation can be
found in the Supplemental Materials. This included 20 mice in
which to study the growth of untreated (control; n= 10) and RT-
treated ( n= 10) in vivo tumors. Tumor tissues from untreated
control animals were used to produce PTO organoids.
Generation and propagation of mouse
tumor derived organoids
The full procedure for organoid production can be found in
the Supplemental Materials. In brief, animals were euthanized
with CO 2when the tumor size reached 1.2 –1.5 cm. Tumors were
excised and washed with cold DMEM/F12 medium and
processed for organoid production as described earlier ( 33,
43). The ﬁnely minced tumor tissues were digested in Tissue
Digestion Cocktail (Collagenase IV (3.75 ml), Dispase (3.75 ml)
and DNase I (1 mg/ml) in DMEM/F12 (22.2 ml) with 15 mMHEPES) for 20 min. The digested tissue fragments were allowed
to settle by gravity for 5 min and supernatant was carefully
removed and passed through 70 µm strainer. The pass through
was discarded and tissues and ductal fragments were collected in
10 ml chilled DMEM/F12 in 15 ml sterile falcon tube.
Subsequently, tubes were centrifuged at 300 X g for 5 min.
Pellet was suspended into 25 µl chilled Matrigel and mixed 5-8
times with cold pipette tip and cultured as dome in prewarmed24 well plate. The plates with Matrigel domes were then
incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes with 5% CO2, and 0.5 mL
pancreatic cult media containing 2.5 ng/ml recombinant EGF,
2.5 ng/ml FGF, (R&D Systems), 2% v/v vitamin B27, 200 mg/ml
ALK5 inhibitor, 0.021 mg/ml gastrin, 81.5 mg/ml N-
acetylcysteine, 122 mg/ml Nicotinamide, 1:1000 Y-27632
(Rho-kinase inhibitor) (Sigma) in 100 ml DMEM/F12
GlutaMAX (ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁc, Waltham, MA). For
coculturing, t cancer associated ﬁbroblasts (CAF) were isolated
from tumor tissues and cultured in 60 mm cell culture dish in
DMEM/F12 media with 5% FBS. After completion of the three
passaging CAF were mixed with organoids in 1:4 ratio and
cultured in Matrigel dome in DMEM/F12 minimal media
lacking noggin, TGF- binhibitor and vitamin B27.
The organoid culture was maintained in the incubator for 3-
4 days to allow organoids to grow. On day four the plates were
treated, and organoid growth was monitored using an EVOS cell
imaging system (ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁc; Waltham, MA) at 4x
magni ﬁcation under bright- ﬁeld light condition for 10 days
following treatment.
In vivo radiation treatment
In vivo tumors on mouse ﬂanks were irradiated at ~2.5 Gy/
min using the Small Animal Radiation Research Platform
(SARRP; Xstrahl; Suwanee, GA) operating at 220 kVp, 0.15-
mm Cu ﬁltration (0.6-mm Cu half-value layer), and 13 mA.
Mice were irradiated sequentially, placed in groups of 3 on the
SARRP ’s robotic stage using a bilateral anterior –posterior/
posterior –anterior (AP/PA) treatment geometry with the
standard 10-mm collimation at a source-to-axis distance of
35 cm. The stage was ﬁrst translated from one animal to the
next to deliver the AP treatment ﬁeld, then the gantry was
rotated from 0° to 180° and the PA ﬁeld delivered to each mouse.
Irradiation times were calculated using CT scans from
representative animals in the SARRP treatment planning
system and veri ﬁed using a mouse-mimicking plastic phantom
and a pinpoint ionization chamber (IBA; Louvain-La-Neuve,
Belgium) cross-calibrated with the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) –traceable Farmer chamber.
Twenty mice (n = 20) with ﬂank tumors were divided into
two treatment groups with ten mice (N = 10) per group: 1)
control (no treatment), and 2) 8 Gy RT. The in vivo tumors on
the mice ﬂanks were treated with fractionated X-ray RT to a totalShukla et al. 10.3389/fonc.2022.1072774
Frontiers in Oncology frontiersin.org 03dose of 8 Gy. The RT was delivered in 2 Gy fractions on
subsequent days.
Treatment of organoids with anti-tumor
drugs and RT
For the RT treatment delivery, the co-cultured organoids
were irradiated at 2.3 Gy/min using an Xrad 320 biological
irradiator (Precision X-Ray; Madison, CT) operating at 320 kVp,
2-mm Al ﬁltration, and 13 mA (1-mm Cu half-value layer).
Samples were placed at 50-cm source-to-surface distance on a
foam surface to eliminate backscatter. Organoids were irradiated
in an AP direction, creating ge ometric conditions closely
matching those used for reference dosimetry. Irradiators for
both in vivo tumor and organoids irradiations were calibrated
using a NIST-traceable PTW TN30013 Farmer-type ionization
chamber and a PTW Unidose electrometer (PTW Freiburg;
Breisgau, Germany) following the American Association of
Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) Task Group 61 in-air
calibration protocol for X-ray irradiators ( 44).
To evaluate proliferation and response of organoids to
fractionated RT, organoids were treated with doses of either 4, 6
or 8 Gy. Irradiation treatments were delivered in fractions of 2 Gy/
fraction, with one fraction delivered per day on subsequent days
until the entire dose was delivered. Moreover, to study effect of
drug 3BP treatment, organoids were treated with 100 µM
concentration (IC50) for 24 hours and growth response was
monitored and recorded by bright ﬁeld imaging. In addition, to
study the combinatorial dose response of 3BP with RT, organoids
were ﬁrst treated with 100 µM of 3BP for 24 hours, followed by 4
Gy RT (delivered in two fractions as described above).
After all treatments, the media was changed, and organoids
were allowed to grow for 10 days. For each treatment, ﬁve (n=5)
organoids were studied. RT and drug induced changes in
organoids morphology was recorded once a day (every 24
hours) for 10 days after chemo treatment or delivery of the
ﬁnal fraction of RT treatment using bright ﬁeld imaging obtained
at 4× and 10× magni ﬁcation with an EVOS microscope
(ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁc, Waltham, MA).
Hematoxylin and eosin staining
H e m a t o x y l i na n de o s i n( H & E) staining of treated and
untreated organoids was performed after organoids were ﬁxed
with 10% formalin for 24 hours at room temperature and
washed with milliQ water before treatment with Vector
Hematoxylin QS (H-3404-100; Vector Laboratories;
Burlingame, CA) and Eosin Y (HT110116; MilliporeSigma;
Burlington, MA). Organoids with Matrigel were rinsed with
ethanol and then MilliQ water between each staining phase.Images were captured with EVOS microscopy at 4× and 10×
magni ﬁcation under bright ﬁeld.
Immuno ﬂuorescence and imaging
Organoids were grown in 24 well plates in 50% Matrigel
(untreated or treated as described above) were ﬁxed in 10%
formalin for 12 hours, washed with 1× PBS for three times, and
treated with 0.2% triton x-100 in 1× PBS for 5 minutes. The
triton x-100 was removed and incubated with blocking reagent
(5% goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin) in 1× PBS for 1
hour. The blocking reagent was removed, and the tumor tissues
and organoids were incubated with either: 1) a primary antibody
anti-mouse vimentin (Biolegend, USA) in a 1:100 dilution, or 2)
with primary antibody anti-rabbit cleaved caspase-3 (Cell
Signaling Technology; Danvers, MA) in a 1:300 dilution in a
cold room overnight. The next day, the antibody was removed
and washed with 1× twin-buffered saline tween (TBST) for 5
minutes each for three times. Tumor tissues and organoids were
incubated with ﬂuorescently labeled secondary antibody Alexa
ﬂuor 488 (ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁc; Waltham, MA) in a 1:400
dilution. After washing with 1× TBST, incubated with Hoechst
dye 1 mg/mL for 15 minutes and washed with 1× PBS for three
times. Finally, 1× PBS was added to the labeled organoids, and
ﬂuorescence images were acquired with green and 4 ′,6-
diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) acquisition ﬁelds.
Co-staining of pancreatic
tumor organoids with aSMA and
vimentin antibodies
The pancreatic tumor organoids were passaged as described
previously. The immuno ﬂuorescence staining was performed as
follows; The organoids were ﬁxed in tissue ﬁxation buffer
containing formalin solution, 10% neutral buffer overnight
(Sigma Chemical, USA). The following day, the ﬁxing was
stopped, and organoids were washed with 1 X PBS 3 times for
5 minutes each. Subsequently, organoids were treated with 0.2%
Triton X-100 followed by blocking with 5% goat serum with 1%
BSA for 1 hour. We used aSMA primary antibodies, rabbit
polyclonal unconjugated at 1:100 dilution (ABclonal, USA) andAlexa ﬂuor 594 conjugated anti-Vimentin (mouse) at 1:300
dilution for overnight in 1:5 dilution in blocking buffer. After
completion of the incubation, primary antibodies were removed,
and organoids were washed as described above. In addition,
Alexa ﬂuor 488 rabbit secondary a ntibody (ThermoFisher
Scienti ﬁc, USA) was used at 1:300 dilution for 1 hour to detect
unconjugated aSMA. Images were captured using EVOS
Microscope (ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁc, USA) under
dark condition.Shukla et al. 10.3389/fonc.2022.1072774
Frontiers in Oncology frontiersin.org 04Analysis of tumors and tumor organoids
response to drugs and radiation treatment
Tumor tissues from 8 untreated control animals were
resected and digested and processed for organoid culture, we
observed growth in about 24 hours and passaged after four
days. Once organoids reached 100 mmi ns i z et h e yw e r et r e a t e d
as follows ( Figure 1 )(1): irradiation with different doses of (4,
or 8 Gy) RT ( 2); 100 µM of 3BP; and 3) combined 4 Gy RT and
100 µM 3BP anti-cancer drug. Untreated organoids were
considered as control. Five (n=5) organoids for each group
were imaged using an EVOS imaging system every day for 10
days starting after chemo or the ﬁnal RT treatment fraction.

length × width) of a rectangula r box placed around the edges of
the organoids ( Supplemental Material Figure S2 ). The average
growth rate factor of organoids was calculated as size on a
speci ﬁed day (N) divided by the size on day 0, for untreated
(control), and for treatment response, the volume of treatedorganoids was recorded as 0 day at ﬁrst day of treatment, and
after 10 days of treatment it wa s recorded as N and the relative
growth was calculated as g= (N/0).
Forin vivo experiment, twenty mice with tumors were
randomized into two treatment groups of ten (n=10) mice
each ( 1): no treatment (controls); and ( 2) fractionated RT to a
total dose of 8 Gy (2 Gy/fraction, 1 fraction/per day x 4 days).
Following treatment, the sizes of in vivo tumors were measured
every day for 10 days. Tumor size was determined in terms of
volume using the formula: V = [W2x L]/2, where V is tumor
volume, W is tumor width, and L is tumor length, each measured
using electronic calipers ( 45).
Statistical analyses

determined from the difference in growth of the control

treatment. Since each comparison involved only two data
groups [ ( 1) control and ( 2)] individual treatment type], the
statistical signi ﬁcance of the difference between the average size
of untreated control organoids and individual treatment type
organoids was calculated using an unpaired one-sided student t-
test ( Pvalue) ( 46). Differences in average organoid size were
considered signi ﬁcant for P< 0.05 and considered highly
signiﬁcant for P< 0.01.Results
Growth and molecular characterization
of pancreatic tumor organoids
To establish and characterize the preclinical PDAC organoid
model, we ﬁrst performed an initial evaluation of the shape and
growth of the untreated control organoids. As shown in Figure 2 ,
PDAC organoids initially developed as dense spheroids and

Frontiers in Oncology frontiersin.org 06grew into an asymmetric and m oderately loose aggregate
spheroid over 10 days ( Figure 2A ,1-3). In the untreated
control samples, ﬁbrotic outgrowth of the PDAC organoids
could be seen as early within 24 hours of incubation at 37°C,
with a rapid, ﬁbrotic cellular outgrowth over the 10 days of
observation. The H & E staining of the organoids further
illustrates the extent of the aggressive ﬁbrotic outgrowth of
pancreatic tumor organoids ( Figure 2B , 1-3). The full extent of
the growth of the organoids ’dense central cores as well as the
growth of the ﬁbrotic arms (combining with outward cellular
growth of other organoids) were found in day 5 and 10. This is
especially apparent in the H&E-stained organoids, where they
exhibited aggressive growth and proliferation of the dense cores.
In addition, tumor organoids showed signi ﬁcant growth
inhibition when treated with 5-FU (10 and 100 µM) alone
(Figure 2C , 1-3), or in combination with 6 Gy of RT
(Figure 2D , 1-3).
As shown in Figure 3 , we again observed that both in vivo
tumor tissues and organoids displayed the strong ﬁbrotic growth
features that is characteristic of pancreatic cancer similar to that
seen in Figure 2 showing similar aggressive growth in tissues and
3D growing organoids. It was noticeable that tumor tissues and
tumor derived organoids shared the same microenvironment,
and IHC images showed expression of TGF- b(Figures 3A ,B),
anda-SMA ( Figures 3C ,D) as their expression was monitored
using immuno ﬂuorescence. Moreover, we also observed
expression of vimentin in tumor tissues and organoids
indicates the presence of cancer associated ﬁbroblasts
(Figures 3E ,F). The similar observation was revealed when
PDAC organoids were co-cultured with tumor ﬁbroblast and
after co-staining presence of vimentin in CAF (red stain) and
aSMA was identi ﬁed in cancer associated ﬁbroblasts ( Figure 3F ;
Supplementary Figure 8 ). However, the PDAC organoids alone,
showed absence of ﬂuorescence signal suggesting absence of
ﬁbroblast cells ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) in the organoids. Thisindicates the importance of cellular components in the
pancreatic tumor microenvironment which have been shown
to affect PDAC resistance to radiation therapy.
To evaluate the radiation response in tumor organoids
proliferation and in vivo tumor growth, organoids and tumor
were treated with 8 Gy radiation in two fractions. The results
indicated the tumor-derived organoids and in vivo tumors
exhibited similar growth rates over the 10 days. Whereasgrowth inhibition in both organoids and in vivo tumors was
observed in the treated group after day four, and inhibition was
consistent ( Figure 4 ). The mechanism of growth inhibition is
due to the upregulation of cleaved caspase-3 ( Figures 5A ,C). The
tumor derived organoids were compared with untreated control
(Figures 5B ,D). Additional experiments demonstrated SOX10
and SOX2 (stem cell markers) expression in tumor organoids
indicated may have some role in radiation and chemotherapy
resistance in pancreatic cancer ( Supplementary Figures S6 ,S7).
Radiation treatment response of PDAC
organoids to different doses of RT
The response of organoids to different doses of radiation was
recorded as the change in average organoid growth factor
following radiation treatment. The dense central cores of the
4-Gy RT treated organoids showed reduced growth up to day 8
compared to the untreated cont rol organoids. A statistical
signiﬁcance was found after 6 days of treatment and the
organoid growth was inhibited for the full 10 days of
observation following treatment. Furthermore, 6- and 8-Gy of
RT treatment demonstrated limited growth at 0-6 days
incubation ( Figure 6 ;Supplementary Figure S2 ,S3). In fact, 8-
Gy of fractionated RT exhibited a decrease in area (GF < 1) after
6 days post treatment. Both 6- and 8-Gy RT treated organoids
showed a statistically signi ﬁcant ( P< 0.05) reduction in growth

compared to control organoids following 6 and 8 Gy of
fractionated RT ( Figure 6 ).
Impact of 3BP anticancer drug alone,
and in combination with RT on
pancreatic tumor organoid growth
Tumor organoids were treated with either 4 Gy RT, 3BP, or a
combination of 4 Gy RT + 3BP to monitor the impact of
different treatment response ( Figure 6 ;Supplementary Figure
S4,S5). The results demonstrated 100 µM of 3BP treatment
(sublethal dose) signi ﬁcantly inhibited the dense organoid cores
growth ( Supplementary Figure S4 ), as compared to control
organoids. Notably, 4 Gy of radiation treatment signi ﬁcantly
reduced organoid growth factor compared to controls after 8
days. Interestingly, when tumor organoids were treated with a
combination of 100 µM of 3BP with 4 Gy of radiation, the
growth factor of the organoids was signi ﬁcantly inhibited with
an overall GF < 1.0 after 10 days ( Figure 7 ).
There were signi ﬁcant noticeable differences in growth
inhibition in 3BP only treated, and combined 3BP + 4 Gy RT
treated organoids, and differences in growth inhibition in both
treatment modalities were statistically signi ﬁcant after 2 days
post treatment, and highly signi ﬁcant after 8 days posttreatment. Therefore, it is envisaged to conclude that
combined treatment of 3BP and radiation was more effective
in killing tumor organoids than the individual treatment for thetumors grown for this investigation.
Discussion
The 3D tumor organoids used in present investigation, were
derived from subcutaneous mouse tumor might be relevant for
studying patient response to RT or chemo-RT. The current study
demonstrated that organoids derived from the mouse tumor
tissues recapitulate drug and radiation response similar to in
vivo tumor (41,47,48). Therefore, this study provides an initial
indication of the potential use of PDAC tumor organoids as a
model to study and predict patient response to treatment ( 49). In
this study, tumor organoids exhibited growth rate characteristics
similar to those of untreated and RT-treated in vivo tumors. H&E
staining and imaging of tumor organoids and corresponding
tumor tissues con ﬁrmed that organoids also showed the
presence of dense ﬁbrotic structures resembling to in vivo
tumors ( 50). In addition, treated tumor organoids showed the
presence of the same apoptosis biomarkers (cleaved caspase 3) as
treated in vivo tumors, indicating that the organoids responded to
treatment in a similar manner. The corollary studies on patient-
derived tumor organoids which also reported activation of cleaved
caspase 3 in chemotherapy (paclitaxel and carboplatin) treated
tumor organoids and in vivo tumors ( 51,52).
This study provided an initial indication that PDAC tumor
organoids exhibit cellular microenvironments similar to those of

organoid response to treatment is similar to that of in vivo
tumors ( 43). We believe these initial similarities justify further
research into producing and con ﬁrming the presence of other
therapeutically important components of the pancreatic tumor
microenvironment, such as c ollagen, hyaluronic acid,
endothelial cells, and immune cells, and to study the
importance of these components to PDAC response to RT,
chemotherapy, and Immunotherapy ( 47,48). The presence of
SOX2 and SOX10 cancer stem cell markers in pancreatic tumor
derived organoids delineates role of cancer stem cells in therapy
resistance in pancreatic cancer ( Supplementary Figure S6 ,S74)
(53). Continued work into the engineering and characterization
of the full microenvironment of the organoids will help to
produce a model that accurately predicts the response of the
organoids derived from an individual tumor (e.g., from patient
biopsy samples) as a means of predicting a patient ’s response to
available treatment regimens prior to treatment. Modeling of the
full tumor microenvironment would provide a wide range of
tumor features in the preclinical organoid model that can be
studied in the development of future pancreatic cancer therapies.
This study, to the best of our knowledge, represents the ﬁrst
investigation of differential responses of PDAC organoids to
fractionated RT, and combination of radiation with 3BP
antitumor drug. Our results demonstrate the potential for usingPDAC-derived organoids to study the sensitivity of an in vivo
tumor to a wide range of treatment regimens such as fractionated
RT, chemotherapy, and combined chemo-RT. The dose response
study showed that tumor organoids could tolerate 4 Gy offractionated RT and exhibited only slightly reduced growth
compared to untreated controls ( Figure 7 ). Further, after
treatment with 6 and 8 Gy RT, the tumor organoids initially
grew very slowly, with growth completely inhibited beyond day 6
following treatment. Interestingly, 8 Gy of fractionated RT was
also effective in completely inhibiting in vivo tumor growth in
animals, both in our study and as reported by Mahmood et al.
(45). We also studied the differential treatment responses of PDAC
organoids to 3BP antitumor drug and a combination of 3BP and 4
Gy RT. The combination treatment of 100 µM of 3BP with 4 Gy
RT produced nearly the same reduction in tumor organoid growth
after 4 days as treatment of the organoids with 6 or 8 Gy RT alone
and showed a near-complete inhibition of growth up to day 10.
The 3D tumor organoid has shown promise as an in vitro
model to predict treatment response to RT and
chemotherapeutic drug in an ef ﬁcient and cost-effective
process. Pancreatic tumor tissues and PBMC from a patient
could be used to produce 3D pancreatic organoids with
microenvironments similar to those of the patient ’s tumor and
used to test the response to a wide range of available radiation,
chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and combination therapies ( 54,
55). This could provide a method to determine the most effective
therapies on an individual patient basis. In present investigation,
we have demonstrated the applicability of pancreatic tumor
derived organoid to predict radiation and drug treatmentresponse, which is analogous to in vivo tumor response.
However, this study also has some limitations, mainly
simulating the same tumor microenvironment and dense
ﬁbrotic stroma present in vivo .
