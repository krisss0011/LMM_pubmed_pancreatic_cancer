Cumulative studies have indicated that high-dose vitamin C has antitumor effects against a variety of cancers. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these inhibitory effects against tumorigenesis and metastasis, particularly in relation to pancreatic cancer, are unclear. Here, we report that vitamin C at high concentrations impairs the growth and survival of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells by inhibiting glucose metabolism. Vitamin C was also found to trigger apoptosis in a caspase-independent manner. We further demonstrate that it suppresses the invasion and metastasis of PDAC cells by inhibiting the Wnt/Î²-catenin-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Taken together, our results suggest that vitamin C has therapeutic effects against pancreatic cancer.
