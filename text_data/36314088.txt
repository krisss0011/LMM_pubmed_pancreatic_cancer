Diabetes and pancreatic cancer have an intricate relationship where each is a risk factor for developing the other. In case of type 2 diabetes, there is an increased probability of developing pancreatic cancer. Similarly, the onset of diabetes often precedes the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Since hyperglycemia is secondary to tumor involvement of the exocrine pancreas, diabetes is considered pancreatogenic. In the current classification, it is part of the entities belonging to type 3c diabetes. The pathophysiology is specific, characterized by a high glycemic variability and a tendency to weight loss. Early identification of inaugural type 3c diabetes would reduce diagnostic delays and could optimize oncologic management. In the absence of specific markers, the challenge for the clinician is indisputable.
