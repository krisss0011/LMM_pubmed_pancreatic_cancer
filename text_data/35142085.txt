Background:Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for patients with borderline resectable and locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma (BRPC/LAPC) remains controversial. Herein, we report on surgical, pathologic, and survival outcomes in BRPC/LAPC patients treated at a high-volume institution with induction chemotherapy (CTX) followed by 5-fraction SBRT.Methods:BRPC/LAPC patients treated between 2016 and 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Surgical and pathological outcomes were descriptively characterized. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard regression. Locoregional failure and distant failure were analyzed with Fine-Gray competing risk model.Results:Of 155 patients, 91 (59%) had LAPC and 64 (41%) had BRPC. Almost all were treated with induction multi-agent CTX with either FOLFIRINOX (75%) or gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (24%) for a median duration of 4.0 months (1-18 months). All received SBRT to a median dose of 33 Gy. Among 64 BRPC patients, 50 (78%) underwent resection, of whom 48 (96%) achieved margin-negative (R0) resection. Among 91 LAPC patients, 57 (63%) underwent resection, of whom 50 (88%) achieved R0 resection. Despite the high R0 rate, 33% of patients experienced locoregional failure, which was a component of 44% of all failures. After SBRT, median OS and PFS were 18.7 and 7.7 months, respectively. After SBRT, 1- and 2-year OS probabilities were 70% and 45%, whereas, from diagnosis, they were 93% and 51%.Conclusions:Although a high proportion of BRPC/LAPC patients treated with induction multi-agent CTX followed by SBRT successfully achieved R0 resection, locoregional failure remained common, highlighting the need to continue to optimize radiation delivery in this context.
