Purpose:Risk factors for sporadic GEP-NENs are still not well defined. To identify the main clinical risk factors represents the aim of this study performed by three Italian referral centers for NENs.Methods:We performed a retrospective case-control study including 148 consecutive sporadic GEP-NENs and 210 age- and sex-matched controls. We collected data on clinical features, cancer family history and other potential risk factors.Results:Mean age was 58.3 Â± 15.8 years; 50% males, primary site was pancreas (50.7%), followed by ileum (22.3%). The 62.8% and 29.1% of cases were G1 and G2, respectively; the 40% had locally advanced or metastatic disease at diagnosis. Independent risk factors for GEP-NENs were: family history of non-neuroendocrine GEP cancer (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.31-3.55, p = 0.003), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.39-4.51, p = 0.002) and obesity (OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.18-2.99, p = 0.007). In the T2DM subjects, metformin use was a protective factor (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.08-0.93, p = 0.049). T2DM was also associated with a more advanced (OR 2.39, 95% CI 1.05-5.46, p = 0.035) and progressive disease (OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.08-5.34, p = 0.03). Stratifying cases by primary site, independent risk factors for pancreatic NENs were T2DM (OR 2.57, 95% CI 1.28-5.15, p = 0.008) and obesity (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.11-3.52, p = 0.020), while for intestinal NENs family history of non-neuroendocrine GEP cancer (OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.38-4.38, p = 0.003) and obesity (OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.08-3.33, p = 0.026).Conclusion:This study reinforces a role for family history of non-neuroendocrine GEP cancer, T2DM and obesity as independent risk factors for GEP-NENs and suggests a role of metformin as a protective factor in T2DM subjects. If confirmed, these findings could have a significant impact on prevention strategies for GEP-NENs.
