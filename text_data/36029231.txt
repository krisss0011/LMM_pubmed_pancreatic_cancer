Objectives:To retrospectively analyze the characteristics of pancreatic cysts with respect to histopathological diagnosis and various diagnostic imaging tools.Methods:The clinical features of 136 patients and characteristics of histopathologically diagnosed cysts were retrospectively assessed. The diagnostic accuracy of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for pancreatic cysts was compared. Risk factors for high-grade dysplasia/invasive cancer in patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) were also determined.Results:The final analysis included 30 serous cystic neoplasms (SCNs) (21.6%), 13 mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs) (9.4%), 65 IPMNs (46.8%), and 13 solid pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPNs) (9.4%). The percentage of women with MCNs, SPNs, SCNs, and IPMNs was 100.0, 76.9, 73.3, and 47.7%, respectively (P < .001). The percentages of patients over 60 years of age with IPMNs, SCNs, MCNs, and SPNs were 73.9, 23.3, 0, and 0%, respectively (P < .001). The percentage of cysts located in the body and tail of the pancreas in MCNs, SCNs, SPNs, and IPMNs was 100, 70, 53.9, and 46.2%, respectively (P < .001). A unique honeycomb appearance was observed in 26.7% of SCNs. The overall diagnostic accuracy of EUS, CT, and MRI for pancreatic cysts was 82.6, 72.5, and 73.9%, respectively. Lesion size and presence of solid components were independent predictors of high-risk IPMNs.Conclusions:Patient characteristics and cyst features can help to differentiate pancreatic cyst types and identify high-risk IPMNs. The diagnostic accuracy of EUS for pancreatic cysts is superior to that of CT and MRI.
