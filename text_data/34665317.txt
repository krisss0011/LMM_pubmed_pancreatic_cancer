Objectives:To derive a CT-based scoring system incorporating arterial involvement and resectability status to predict R0 resection in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (CRT).Methods:This retrospective study included 112 patients with PDAC who underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced CT before and after neoadjuvant CRT. A 5-point score was used to determine arterial involvement (A score; 1 = no involvement, 2 = haziness, 3 = abutment, 4 = encasement, 5 = deformity) and 4-point score evaluating resectability status (R score; 1 = resectable, 2 = borderline resectable [BR] with venous involvement, 3 = BR with arterial involvement, 4 = locally advanced [LA]). A score before and after CRT were summed with R score before and after CRT to compute the AR score (ARtotal). The associations between ARtotal, R0 resection, overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS) were assessed.Results:The ARtotalwas associated with R0 resection (p < .001) and showed area under the ROC curve of 0.79 for differentiating R0 and R1 resections. Median OS was significantly lower for patients with ARtotal> 9 (median: 35.2 months) compared to patients with ARtotal≤ 9 (median: not estimable) (p < .001). Similar results were observed for DFS (median, 16.8 months in > 9 vs median, not estimable in ≤ 9; p < .001).Conclusions:A composite score which incorporates degree of arterial involvement and resectability status before and after neoadjuvant CRT is associated with R0 resection and discriminates between R0 and R1 resections in PDAC.Key points:• A scoring system incorporating arterial involvement and resectability status was associated with R0 resection. • ARtotal> 9 could predict patients' overall and disease-free survival.
