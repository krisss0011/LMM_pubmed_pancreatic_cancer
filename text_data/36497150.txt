Recently, evidence has shown that GOT1 expression is upregulated in pancreatic cancer tissues and promotes cancer development, but the specific mechanism remains unclear. We found that GOT1 expression was upregulated in pancreatic cancer cell-derived exosomes. When PANC-1 cells were incubated with exosomes alone or transfected together with si-GOT1, we found that exosomes enhanced cell proliferation, invasion and migration, promoted ferroptosis, and si-GOT1 reversed the effects of exosomes. The results of online bioinformatics database analysis indicated that CCR2 was a potential binding protein of GOT1 and is highly expressed in pancreatic cancer tissues. PANC-1 cells were transfected with pcDNA-CCR2 or si-CCR2, and it was found that pcDNA-CCR2 enhanced cell proliferation, invasion and migration, promoted ferroptosis, and si-CCR2 had an opposite effect. Next, exosome-treated cells were transfected with si-GOT1 alone or together with pcDNA-CCR2, and we found that exosomes promoted CCR2 expression, promoted cell proliferation and invasion, and inhibited ferroptosis, the transfection of si-GOT1 abolished the effect of exosomes, and the transfection of pcDNA-CCR2 again reversed the effect of si-GOT1. Furthermore, when exosome-treated cells were transfected with si-GOT1 alone or co-incubated with Nrf2 activator NK-252, we found that si-GOT1 reversed the promoting effect of exosomes on Nrf2 and HO-1 expression, as well as its inhibitory effect on ferroptosis, but this effect was abrogated by NK-252. In vivo studies showed that knockdown of GOT1 expression inhibited tumor formation compared with tumor tissues formed upon exosome induction, which was mediated by promoting ferroptosis via suppressing the protein expression of GOT1, CCR2, Nrf2 and HO-1 in tumor tissues.
