Insulinomas are the most common neoplasms of the endocrine pancreas in dogs, 
leading to persistent hypoglycemia due to inappropriate insulin secretion. The 
standard treatment is surgical resection, but it carries significant risks, 
including pancreatitis and diabetes mellitus. This study investigates the 
efficacy and safety of percutaneous ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation 
(RFA) as an alternative to surgery. A total of 29 dogs diagnosed with insulinoma 
were treated with RFA, targeting both primary pancreatic tumors and metastases 
in regional lymph nodes or the liver. Blood glucose levels and tumor size were 
monitored before and after the procedure. RFA led to a significant increase in 
blood glucose levels and a reduction in tumor size in all patients, with minimal 
postoperative complications. The results suggest that RFA is a feasible and 
effective treatment option for insulinomas in dogs.
