An insulinoma is a rare functional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour that is usually sporadic and solitary. The hallmark is hypersecretion of insulin, which leads to neuroglycopenia symptoms and uncontrolled sympathoadrenal activity. Neuroendocrine tumours can have a varied presentation, with symptoms often ascribed to a different diagnosis, thus delaying correct diagnosis and treatment. We present the case of a 26-year-old female who had a 3-year delay before diagnosing insulinoma after being initially assessed with epilepsy and schizophrenia. The case report below provides a detailed review of the diagnosis, tumour localization, and surgical interventions implemented for the patient during the COVID-19 pandemic.
