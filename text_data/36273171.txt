Background:Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are considered to play a fundamental role in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) progression and chemoresistance. Patient-derived organoids have demonstrated great potential as tumor avatars for drug response prediction in PDAC, yet they disregard the influence of stromal components on chemosensitivity.Methods:We established direct three-dimensional (3D) co-cultures of primary PDAC organoids and patient-matched CAFs to investigate the effect of the fibroblastic compartment on sensitivity to gemcitabine, 5-fluorouracil and paclitaxel treatments using an image-based drug assay. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed for three organoid/CAF pairs in mono- and co-culture to uncover transcriptional changes induced by tumor-stroma interaction.Results:Upon co-culture with CAFs, we observed increased proliferation and reduced chemotherapy-induced cell death of PDAC organoids. Single-cell RNA sequencing data evidenced induction of a pro-inflammatory phenotype in CAFs in co-cultures. Organoids showed increased expression of genes associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in co-cultures and several potential receptor-ligand interactions related to EMT were identified, supporting a key role of CAF-driven induction of EMT in PDAC chemoresistance.Conclusions:Our results demonstrate the potential of personalized PDAC co-cultures models not only for drug response profiling but also for unraveling the molecular mechanisms involved in the chemoresistance-supporting role of the tumor stroma.
