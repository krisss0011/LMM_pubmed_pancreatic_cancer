The case was a 72-year-old man who had been on medication due to chronic pancreatitis since 2009 and was referred to our hospital because dilation of the main pancreatic duct was shown by abdominal ultrasonography. The contrast CT scan of the abdomen showed a 30 mm in size, poorly enhanced tumor at the body of the pancreas, which was suspected to invasion the celiac artery, common hepatic artery, and splenic artery. EUS showed a hypoechoic tumor with a diameter of 29Ã— 24 mm. ERCP showed disruption of the pancreatic duct in the body of the pancreas, and cytological examination of the pancreatic juice showed a suspicious positive result. We diagnosed unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer in the body of the pancreas and underwent chemotherapy(gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel: GnP). Contrast-enhanced CT after 6 courses of GnP showed tumor shrinkage. FDG-PET/CT revealed a slightly in fluorine-18-deoxyglucose(FDG)accumulation in the tumor, but no accumulation around the blood vessels. Based on the above, it was judged that the tumor was possible radical resection, and surgery was performed. Intraoperative frozen section examination revealed no malignant findings in the tissues surrounding the main artery near the pancreatic body cancer, and distal pancreatectomy was performed. Histopathologically, the tumor showed findings of tubular adenocarcinoma, and the histological response to neoadjuvant therapy was Grade 2. We report a case in which conversion surgery was possible by chemotherapy.
