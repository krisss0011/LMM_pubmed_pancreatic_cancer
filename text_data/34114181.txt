Background:Many studies show significantly improved survival after R0 resection compared with R1 resection in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC); however, the effect of neoadjuvant chemoradiation (NACRT) on this association is unknown.Objective:The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of positive surgical margins (SMs) after NACRT compared with upfront surgery + adjuvant therapy in PAC.Methods:All cases of surgically resected PAC at a single institution were reviewed from 1996 to 2014; patients treated with palliative intent, metastatic disease, and biliary/ampullary tumors were excluded. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS).Results:Overall, 300 patients were included; 134 patients received NACRT with concurrent 5-fluorouracil or gemcitabine followed by surgery, and 166 patients received upfront surgery (+ adjuvant chemotherapy in 72% of patients and RT in 65%); 31% of both groups had a positive SM (+SM). The median OS for patients with a +SM or negative SM (-SM) was 26.6 and 31.6 months, respectively for NACRT, and 12.0 and 24.5 months, respectively, for upfront surgery. OS was significantly improved with -SM compared with +SM in both groups (p = 0.006). When resection yielded +SM, NACRT patients had improved OS compared with upfront surgery patients (p < 0.001). On multivariable analysis, +SM in the upfront surgery group (hazard ratio [HR] 2.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.04-4.24; p < 0.001) and older age (HR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.03, per year; p = 0.007) predicted worse OS. +SM in the NACRT group was not associated with worse OS (HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.72-1.65; p = 0.70).Conclusion:Patients with a positive margin after NACRT and surgery had longer survival compared with patients with a positive margin after upfront surgery. NACRT should be strongly considered for patients at high risk of R1 resections.
