Pancreatic cancer is an increasingly growing source of cancer-related deaths and is often diagnosed at advanced stages. Its treatment is difficult because of the poor results of conventional treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Microbiota and their products can regulate the microenvironment of pancreatic tumors, the biological behavior of pancreatic cancer cells, and the functionality of the immune system. Promising results have been achieved in treating pancreatic cancer by regulating microbiota. However, intratumoral microbiota is still in its infancy as a new field of discovery for pancreatic cancer. This review summarizes the mechanisms by which intratumoral microbiota causes pancreatic cancer tumorigenesis, progression, and metastasis and demonstrates their significant potential in diagnosing and treating pancreatic cancer. Additionally, we present an outlook on the future of intratumoral microbiota in treating pancreatic cancer.
