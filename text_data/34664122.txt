Introduction:Meta-analysis aimed to quantify the relationship between intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) and increased incidence of extra-pancreatic malignancy (EPM) previously reported in qualitative observational cohort studies.Methods:Study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020169614) and conducted to the Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology and systematic review reported with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews guidelines.Results:Sixteen studies (total of 8240 patients) were included in the pooled, and 7399 patients in the subgroup meta-analyses. The odds ratio (OR) for any EPM in the presence of IPMN was 57.9 (95% confidence interval 40.5-82.7), fixed effects, I2= 59% (p < 0.0014). Subgroup analysis for any gastrointestinal EPM (i.e. oesophagus, stomach, colon and rectum) in the presence of an IPMN estimated an overall OR of 12.9 (95% confidence interval 8.8-19.0), fixed effects, I2= 64% (p < 0.0004).Conclusion:Patients with an IPMN are categorically at increased risk for a higher incidence of EPM and particularly the odds of a gastrointestinal malignancy are also increased in comparison with the general population. We advocate that patients presenting with an IPMN should be considered for gastrointestinal screening including colonoscopy, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy or computed tomography.
