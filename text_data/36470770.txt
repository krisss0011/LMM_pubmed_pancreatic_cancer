Background:The oncogenic process is orchestrated by a complex network of chromatin remodeling elements that shape the cancer epigenome. Histone variant H2A.Z regulates DNA control elements such as promoters and enhancers in different types of cancer; however, the interplay between H2A.Z and the pancreatic cancer epigenome is unknown.Objective:This study analyzed the role of H2A.Z in different DNA regulatory elements.Methods:We performed Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing assays (ChiP-seq) with total H2A.Z and acetylated H2A.Z (acH2A.Z) antibodies and analyzed published data from ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, bromouridine labeling-UV and sequencing (BruUV-seq), Hi-C and ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing) in the pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1.Results:The results indicate that total H2A.Z facilitates the recruitment of RNA polymerase II and transcription factors at promoters and enhancers allowing the expression of pro-oncogenic genes. Interestingly, we demonstrated that H2A.Z is enriched in super-enhancers (SEs) contributing to the transcriptional activation of key genes implicated in tumor development. Importantly, we established that H2A.Z contributes to the three-dimensional (3D) genome organization of pancreatic cancer and that it is a component of the Topological Associated Domains (TADs) boundaries in PANC-1 and that total H2A.Z and acH2A.Z are associated with A and B compartments, respectively.Conclusions:H2A.Z participates in the biology and development of pancreatic cancer by generating a pro-oncogenic transcriptome through its posttranslational modifications, interactions with different partners, and regulatory elements, contributing to the oncogenic 3D genome organization. These data allow us to understand the molecular mechanisms that promote an oncogenic transcriptome in pancreatic cancer mediated by H2A.Z.
