Background:Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is one of the most frequent adverse events observed with taxane use, whose disability often required modification or treatment discontinuation. The aim of this study was to assess the value of several variables as risk factors for CIPN development.Material and methods:Eligible patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer receiving chemotherapy with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine were assessed in a multicenter study. Peripheral neuropathy was categorized using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria scale, version 4.02, and a physical/neurological examination. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to identify blood-based and clinical factors associated with CIPN.Results:Data were available from 153 patients from five Italian centers. Key risk factors of CIPN in univariate regression models included age, number of chemotherapy cycles, statin assumption, and concomitant comorbidities. However, in the multivariate analysis, only for age (OR 1.0, p < 0.01, 95% CI: 1.01-1.11) and the number of cycles (OR 1.22, p < 0.01, 95% CI: 1.09-1.36), the correlation with CIPN development has been confirmed.Conclusion:Our study confirms age and the number of chemotherapy cycles as CIPN risk factors. The identification and validation of different risk factors could be advantageous to prevent or optimize management of CIPN which outstandingly affect the patient's quality of life.
