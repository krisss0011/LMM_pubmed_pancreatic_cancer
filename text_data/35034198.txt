Background and objectives:Multiple-port robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy (RPD) has been increasingly used as an alternative to open pancreaticoduodenectomy (OPD) in pancreatic cancer. However, the comparative safety and efficacy of reduced-port RPD versus OPD are unknown.Methods:This was a prospective cohort study comprising adult patients who underwent reduced-port RPD (single-port or single-site plus one port) or OPD for malignant tumors of the pancreas and periampullary region from July 2015 to October 2020 at a single center. We collected data on the patient demographics, perioperative results, oncologic outcomes, and one-year survival.Results:Forty-five patients underwent reduced-port RPD, and 13 underwent OPD. There were no significant differences in the age, sex, body mass index, ASA score, tumor location, or occurrences of postoperative complications between the two groups. Compared with OPD, reduced-port RPD was associated with less blood loss (300 ml [95% confidence interval {CI} 155-700] vs. 650 ml [95% CI 300-850], p value = 0.11) but a longer operative time (325 min [95% CI 290-370] vs. 215 min [95% CI 180-270], p value < 0.001). Compared with patients who underwent OPD, patients who underwent reduced-port RPD had a higher 1-year survival rate (68% [95% CI 49-81] vs. 22% [95% CI 3-51], log-rank, p value = 0.007).Conclusions:Reduced-port RPD can be safely performed in experienced surgeons and is associated with better perioperative and oncologic outcomes than OPD.
