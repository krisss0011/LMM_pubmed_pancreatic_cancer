Aims:In England, not all cancer drugs are routinely funded; new medicines are first appraised by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. Funding can be temporarily given through the Cancer Drugs Fund while further information is collected. The Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy (SACT) dataset collects information on all patients receiving chemotherapy in England. To date, little has been published, despite concerns that real-world effectiveness of medicines may be inferior to that seen in clinical trials. The aim of the present study was to establish the feasibility of using our local copy of routinely collected SACT data for the evaluation of outcomes, using the data within the context of gastrointestinal cancers.Materials and methods:We used our local SACT dataset submissions from three National Health Service trusts, with a reproducible method of data linkage, to undertake a cohort analysis of treatment duration and overall survival for cetuximab, panitumumab, trifluridine/tipiracil (all three in colorectal cancer), sorafenib (in hepatocellular cancer) and nab-paclitaxel (nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel) with gemcitabine (in pancreatic cancer) for all patients treated from May 2016 to March 2021.Results:In our population, epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors and trifluridine/tipiracil and sorafenib performed similarly to expected but nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer seemed to be no better than gemcitabine alone, when given within the current funding arrangements in England.Conclusions:Our results support the publication of national outcome data. If these results are confirmed on a larger cohort, it would support the reappraisal of certain drugs and provide further evidence to clinicians and patients when deciding the best treatment.
