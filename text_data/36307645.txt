Pancreatic neoplasms, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) and pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCNs), are the most puzzling diseases. Numerous studies have not brought significant improvements in prognosis and diagnosis, especially in PDAC. One important reason is that previous studies only focused on differences between patients and healthy individuals but ignored intratumoral heterogeneity. In recent years, single-cell sequencing techniques, represented by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), have emerged by which researchers can analyse each cell in tumours instead of their average levels. Herein, we summarise the new current knowledge of single-cell sequencing in pancreatic neoplasms with respect to techniques, tumour heterogeneities and treatments.
