Early detection of pancreatic cancer has long eluded clinicians because of its insidious nature and onset. Often metastatic or locally invasive when symptomatic, most patients are deemed inoperable. In those who are symptomatic, multi-modal imaging modalities evaluate and confirm pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. In asymptomatic patients, detected pancreatic lesions can be either solid or cystic. The clinical implications of identifying small asymptomatic solid pancreatic lesions (SPLs) of < 2 cm are tantamount to a better outcome. The accurate detection of SPLs undoubtedly promotes higher life expectancy when resected early, driving the development of existing imaging tools while promoting more comprehensive screening programs. An imaging tool that has matured in its reiterations and received many image-enhancing adjuncts is endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). It carries significant importance when risk stratifying cystic lesions and has substantial diagnostic value when combined with fine needle aspiration/biopsy (FNA/FNB). Adjuncts to EUS imaging include contrast-enhanced harmonic EUS and EUS-elastography, both having improved the specificity of FNA and FNB. This review intends to compile all existing enhancement modalities and explore ongoing research around the most promising of all adjuncts in the field of EUS imaging, artificial intelligence.
