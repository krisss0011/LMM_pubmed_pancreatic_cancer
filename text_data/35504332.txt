Aims:Pancreatic cancer is a fatal disease across the world with 5 years survival rate less than 10%. ATAD2, a valid cancer drug-target, is overexpressed in pancreatic malignancy with high oncogenic potential. However, the mechanism of the upregulated expression of ATAD2 in pancreatic cancer is unknown. Since microRNAs (miRNAs) could potentially control target mRNA expressions, and are involved in cancer as tumor-suppressors, oncomiR or both, we examine the possibility of miRNA-mediated regulation of ATAD2 in pancreatic cancer cells (PCCs).Main methods:Our in-silico approach first identifies hsa-miR-217 as a candidate regulator for ATAD2 expression. For further validation, luciferase reporter assay is performed. We overexpress hsa-miRNA-217 and assess cellular viability, migration, apoptosis and cell cycle progression in three different PCCs (BxPC3, PANC1, and MiaPaCa2).Key findings:We find hsa-miRNA-217 has potential binding site at the 3'UTR of ATAD2. Luciferase assay confirms that ATAD2 is a direct target of hsa-miR-217. Overexpression of hsa-miR-217 drastically downregulates ATAD2 expression in PCCs, thus, corroborating binding studies. The elevated expression of hsa-miRNA-217 diminishes cell proliferation and migration as well as induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in PCCs. Finally, siRNA mediated ATAD2 knockdown or overexpression of hsa-miRNA-217 in PCCs showed inactivation of the AKT signaling pathway. Therefore, hsa-miR-217 abrogates pancreatic cancer progression through inactivation of the AKT signaling pathway and this might be partly due to miR-217 mediated suppression of ATAD2 expression.Significance:The application of hsa-miR-217 mimic could be a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer patients in near future.
