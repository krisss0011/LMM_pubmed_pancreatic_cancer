Research from epidemiologic studies and experimental animal models provide insights into the role of pancreatic steatosis in the development of pancreatic cancer. Epidemiologic data demonstrate that pancreatic steatosis is widely prevalent and significantly associated with both development and progression of pancreatic cancer. By focusing on current experimental models, this review elucidates potential cellular mechanisms underlying not only the pathophysiology of pancreatic steatosis itself, but also the pathogenesis behind pancreatic steatosis's role in changing the tumour microenvironment and accelerating the development of pancreatic cancer. This review further explores the impact of bariatric surgery on pancreatic steatosis and pancreatic cancer. Synthesizing knowledge from both epidemiologic studies and experimental animal models, this review identifies gaps in current knowledge regarding pancreatic steatosis and its role in carcinogenesis and proposes future research directions to elucidate the possible mechanisms underlying other obesity-associated cancers.
