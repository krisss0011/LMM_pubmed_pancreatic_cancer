Introduction:Elderly patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head can achieve reasonable survival with multimodal therapy. An analysis specific to cancers of the pancreatic tail has not been published.Methods:We identified patients ≥65 years with localized adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic tail in the National Cancer Database (2011-2017). Patients were grouped by age (65-79 and ≥80 years) and categorized by treatment regimen. Postoperative outcomes and survival were analyzed using propensity score matching and multivariable logistical regression.Results:2168 patients were included: 73.9% were 65-79 years and 26.1% were ≥80 years. 34.1% of octogenarians did not receive any treatment, relative to 15.9% of younger patients (p < 0.001). Thirty-day mortality rates were similar in operatively managed patients; however, the 90-day mortality rate among octogenarians was greater (3.0% vs. 7.8%, p < 0.001; odds ratio [OR] = 1.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07-3.19). Age ≥ 80 was not associated with survival on multivariable hazards regression (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.08, 95% CI = 0.95-1.24). After propensity matching, the addition of chemotherapy was not associated with improved survival relative to distal pancreatectomy alone among octogenarians (HR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.72-1.65).Conclusions:Management of adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic tail varies based on patient age. Resection appears to play a key role in management, but there is substantial upfront risk. Shared decision making should be employed to balance the chance for long-term survival with the risk of early mortality.
