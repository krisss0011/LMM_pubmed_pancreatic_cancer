Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is an aggressive malignancy that carries a poor prognosis because the majority of patients present with locally advanced or metastatic disease. However, even patients who are fortunate enough to present with resectable disease are often plagued by high recurrence rates. While adjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to decrease the risk of recurrence after surgery, post operative complications and poor performance status after surgery prevent up to 50% of patients from receiving it. Given the benefits of neoadjuvant therapy in patients with borderline resectable disease, it is understandable that neoadjuvant therapy has been steadily increasing in patients with resectable cancers as well. In this review paper, we highlight the rational and existing evidence of using neoadjuvant therapy in all patients with resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
