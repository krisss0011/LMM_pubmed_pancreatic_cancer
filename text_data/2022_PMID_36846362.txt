Arjunolic acid (AA) is a pentacyclic triterpenoid with promising anticancer 
properties. A series of novel AA derivatives containing a pentameric A-ring with 
an enal moiety, combined with additional modifications at C-28, were designed 
and prepared. The biological activity on the viability of human cancer and 
non-tumor cell lines was evaluated in order to identify the most promising 
derivatives. Additionally, a preliminary study of the structure-activity 
relationship was carried out. The most active derivative, derivative 26, also 
showed the best selectivity between malignant cells and non-malignant 
fibroblasts. For compound 26, the anticancer molecular mechanism of action in 
PANC-1 cells was further studied and the results showed that this derivative 
induced a cell-cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and significantly inhibited the wound 
closure rate of PANC-1 cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner. 
Additionally, compound 26 synergistically increased the cytotoxicity of 
Gemcitabine, especially at a concentration of 0.24 μM. Moreover, a preliminary 
pharmacological study indicated that at lower doses this compound did not 
demonstrate toxicity in vivo. Taken together, these findings suggest that 
compound 26 may be a valuable compound for the development of new pancreatic 
anticancer treatment, and further studies are needed to explore its full 
potential.
