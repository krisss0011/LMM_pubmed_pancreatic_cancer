However, the overall efficacy of pancreatic cancer is still dismal and the 5-year survival rate is only about 10%. Further improving the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer is the top priority of oncology research and clinical practice. Based on past clinical and scientific research experience, the authors have proposed ten hot spots and future directions for a reference, which focusing on early prevention, early diagnosis, and early treatment of pancreatic cancer, molecular typing and precise treatment, new drug development and regimen combination, surgical technology and strategy change, model establishment and database development, as well as innovation of traditional Chinese medicine and breakthrough of treatment concept. A breakthrough in the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer in the next ten years is raising hope, when doctors can truly prevent and control pancreatic cancer.
