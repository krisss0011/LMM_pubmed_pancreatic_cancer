Background:Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is still considered as one of the most aggressive cancers with low percentages of respectability, despite recent advances in diagnosis. Assessment of preoperative inflammatory markers can increase the rates of resectability.Methods:Patients with potentially resectable pancreatic adenoinvesticarcinoma in a single pancreatic unit were included. Ninety-six patient during a one year period were eligible for analysis.Results:CRP, d-dimers, and fibrinogen levels were similar between the two groups. On the contrary, there were statistically significant differences regarding the prognostic nutritional index (PNI) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR).Conclusions:inflammatory markers can act as an additional tool in predicting resectability in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
