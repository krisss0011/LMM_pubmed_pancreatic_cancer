Background:Pancreatic cancer is a common gastrointestinal malignancy, and is often associated with a poor prognosis. Although liver is generally seen as a distant metastasis point, it has been shown that it can metastasize to any organ, especially the gastrointestinal tract, and approximately 0.3% of metastases are observed in spinal cord.Case description:We report a 36-year-old woman with a prior history of pancreatic adenocarcinoma who presented to us with a thoracic intramedullary lesion and recent onset of neurological deficits. She underwent surgery with histological confirmation of a diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma.Conclusion:To our knowledge there is no prior report of pure intramedullary spinal cord metastasis from a pancreatic adenocarcinoma in the literature. We report the present patient in view of the rarity of intramedullary spinal cord metastasis and its clinical significance. Although intramedullary metastases are rare, they should be investigated in every patient with malignancy and progressive neurological deficit. While its general prognosis is poor regardless of the type of treatment, early diagnosis and treatment is important in terms of quality of life and survival.
