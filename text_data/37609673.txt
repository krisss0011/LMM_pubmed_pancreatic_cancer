Pancreatic cancer has a high mortality and morbidity and its incidence has increased over the years. Our objective was to analyze the demographic and clinical data among pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients who presented to the University Surgical Unit, CSTH from 2018 to 2021. Of the 103 patients included, majority were males above the age of 60. The commonest presentation was epigastric pain (54%). 46% were resectable at the time of diagnosis but 50% of the study population were lost to follow up due to a multitude of reasons.
