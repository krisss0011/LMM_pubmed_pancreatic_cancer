Background/aim:We previously observed higher prevalence of high-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) in LSL-KrasG12D/+; Pdx1Cre/+(KC-Crmp4wild) mice than LSL-KrasG12D/+; Pdx1Cre/+; Crmp4-/-(KC-Crmp4-/-) mice. This study investigated the relationship between collapsin response mediator protein 4 (CRMP4) and immune cell infiltration in pancreatic cancer.Materials and methods:PanIN was induced by intraperitoneal injection of caerulein into KC-Crmp4wildand KC-Crmp4-/-mice, and immune cells in PanIN lesions were compared. Subcutaneous tumors were created by injecting Pan02 cells, and tumor diameter was compared between Crmp4wildand Crmp4-/-mice every 7 days. Peritumoral immune cells were examined immunohisto chemically.Results:High-grade PanIN in KC mice showed statistically significantly high expression of CD163 (p=0.031) and CD11b (p=0.027). Following subcutaneous injection of Pan02 cells, tumor diameter was greater in Crmp4wildmice than Crmp4-/-mice. Crmp4wildmice exhibited higher CD163 and CD11b expression than Crmp4-/-mice in tumors (p<0.001).Conclusion:CRMP4 might promote pancreatic cancer by up-regulating M2 macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells.
