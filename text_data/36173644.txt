Pancreatic cancer is a devastating and lethal human malignancy with no curable chemo-treatments available thus far. More than 90% of pancreatic tumors are formed from ductal epithelium as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which often accompany with the expression of mutantK-ras. The incidences of pancreatic cancer are expected to increase rapidly worldwide in the near future, due to environmental pollution, obesity epidemics and etc. The dismal prognosis of this malignancy is contributed to its susceptibility to tumor micro-metastasis from inception and the lack of methods to detect precursor lesions at very early stages of the onset until clinical symptoms occur. In recent years, basic and clinical studies have been making promising progresses for discovering markers to determine the subtypes or stages of this malignancy, which allow effectively implementing personalized therapeutic interventions. The purpose of this review is to discuss the existing knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of pancreatic cancer and the current state of treatment options with the emphasis on targeting therapeutic approaches. The specific focuses are on the molecular mechanisms of the disease, identifications of drug resistance, establishment of immune escaping mechanisms as well as potential of targeting identified pathways in combinations with existing chemo-drugs.
