Mucin 1 is a transmembrane glycoprotein which overexpresses cancer-specific epitopes (MUC1-CE) on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells. As PDAC is a low survival and highly aggressive malignancy, developing radioimmunoconjugates capable of targeting MUC1-CE could lead to improvements in PDAC outcomes. The aim of this study was to develop and perform preliminary testing of diagnostic and therapeutic radioimmunoconjugates for PDAC using an anti-MUC1 antibody, C595. Firstly, p-SCN-Bn-DOTA was conjugated to the C595 antibody to form a DOTA-C595 immunoconjugate. The stability and binding affinity of the DOTA-C595 conjugate was evaluated using mass spectrometry and ELISA. DOTA-C595 was radiolabelled to Copper-64, Lutetium-177, Gallium-68 and Technetium-99m to form novel radioimmunoconjugates. Cell binding assays were performed in PANC-1 (strong MUC1-CE expression) and AsPC-1 (weak MUC1-CE expression) cell lines using64Cu-DOTA-C595 and177Lu-DOTA-C595. An optimal molar ratio of 4:1 DOTA groups per C595 molecule was obtained from the conjugation process. DOTA-C595 labelled to Copper-64, Lutetium-177, and Technetium-99m with high efficiency, although the Gallium-68 labelling was low.177Lu-DOTA-C595 demonstrated high cellular binding to the PANC-1 cell lines which was significantly greater than AsPC-1 binding at concentrations exceeding 100 nM (p< 0.05).64Cu-DOTA-C595 showed similar binding to the PANC-1 and AsPC-1 cells with no significant differences observed between cell lines (p> 0.05). The high cellular binding of177Lu-DOTA-C595 to MUC1-CE positive cell lines suggests promise as a therapeutic radioimmunoconjugate against PDAC while further work is required to harness the potential of64Cu-DOTA-C595 as a diagnostic radioimmunoconjugate.
