Pancreatic cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the USA. The 5-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer is as low as 10%, making it one of the most deadly cancers. This dismal prognosis is caused, in part, by the lack of early detection and screening options, leading to late-stage detection of the disease, at a point at which chemotherapy is no longer effective. However, nanoparticle (NP) drug delivery systems have increased the efficacy of chemotherapeutics by improving the targeting ability of drugs to the tumor site, while also decreasing the risk of local and systemic toxicity. Such efforts can contribute to the development of early diagnosis and routine screening tests, which will drastically improve the survival rates and prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer.
