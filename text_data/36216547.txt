In this study, a 76-year-old man initially diagnosed with branch-duct pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous tumor is presented. During follow-up, stenosis was discovered in the main pancreatic duct of the tail. A nodular lesion was found in the pancreatic duct consistent with the stenosis. Distal pancreatectomy was performed since it was suspected to be malignant. Histopathology revealed polymorphic mononuclear cells proliferated with osteoclast-like giant cells in the nodule. The patient was finally diagnosed with anaplastic pancreatic cancer with osteoclast-like giant cells, a relatively rare tumor. It is reported herein with a review of the literature.
