Drug-resistant capacity in a small population of tumor-initiating cancer stem cells (tiCSCs) can be due to aberrant epigenetic changes. However, currently available conventional detection methods are inappropriate and cannot be applied to investigate the scarce population (tiCSCs). In addition, selective inhibitor drugs are shown to reverse epigenetic changes; however, each cancer type is discrete. Hence, it is essential to probe the resultant changes in tiCSCs even after therapy. Therefore, we have developed a multimode nanoplatform to investigate tiCSCs, detect epigenetic changes, and subsequently explore their transformation signals following drug therapy. We performed this by developing a surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-active nanoplatform integrated with n-dopant using an ultrafast laser ionization technique. The dopant functionalization enhances Raman scattering ability and permits label-free analysis of biomarkers in tiCSCs with the resolution down to the cellular level. Here, we investigated epigenetic biomarkers of tiCSCs in pancreatic and lung cancers. An extended study using inhibitor drugs demonstrates an unexpected increase of tiCSCs from lung cancer; this difference can be attributed to transformation changes in lung tiCSC. Thus, our work brings new insight into the differentiation abilities of CSCs upon epigenetic reversal, emphasizing unique perceptions in cancer treatment.
