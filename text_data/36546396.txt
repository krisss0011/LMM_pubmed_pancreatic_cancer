Pancreatic cancer is a deadly and highly metastatic disease, although how metastatic lesions establish is not fully understood. A key feature of pancreatic tumours is extensive fibrosis and deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). While pancreatic cancer cells are programmed by stimuli derived from a stiff ECM, metastasis requires loss of attachment and adaptation to a softer microenvironment at distant sites. Growing evidence suggests that stiff ECM influences pancreatic cancer cell behaviour. Here, we argue that this influence is reversible and that pancreatic cancer cells can be reprogrammed upon sensing soft substrates. Using engineered polyacrylamide hydrogels with tuneable mechanical properties, we show that collagen VI is specifically upregulated in pancreatic cancer cells on soft substrates, due to a lack of integrin engagement. Furthermore, the expression of collagen VI is inversely correlated with mechanosensing and activity of YAP (also known as YAP1), which might be due to a direct or indirect effect on transcription of genes encoding collagen VI. Collagen VI supports migration in vitro and metastasis formation in vivo. Metastatic nodules formed by pancreatic cancer cells lacking Col6a1 display stromal cell-derived collagen VI deposition, suggesting that collagen VI derived from either cancer cells or the stroma is an essential component of the metastatic niche.
