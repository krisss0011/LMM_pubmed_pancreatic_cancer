Background:Hyperglycaemia is a well-known initial symptom in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Metabolic reprogramming in cancer, described as the Warburg effect, can induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).Methods:The biological impact of hyperglycaemia on malignant behaviour in PDAC was examined by in vitro and in vivo experiments.Results:Hyperglycaemia promoted EMT by inducing metabolic reprogramming into a glycolytic phenotype via yes-associated protein (YAP)/PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) overexpression, accompanied by GLUT1 overexpression and enhanced phosphorylation Akt in PDAC. In addition, hyperglycaemia enhanced chemoresistance by upregulating ABCB1 expression and triggered PDAC switch into pure basal-like subtype with activated Hedgehog pathway (GLI1 high, GATA6 low expression) through YAP/TAZ overexpression. PDAC is characterised by abundant stroma that harbours tumour-promoting properties and chemoresistance. Hyperglycaemia promotes the production of collagen fibre-related proteins (fibronectin, fibroblast activation protein, COL1A1 and COL11A1) by stimulating YAP/TAZ expression in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Knockdown of YAP and/or TAZ or treatment with YAP/TAZ inhibitor (K975) abolished EMT, chemoresistance and a favourable tumour microenvironment even under hyperglycemic conditions in vitro and in vivo.Conclusion:Hyperglycaemia induces metabolic reprogramming into glycolytic phenotype and promotes EMT via YAP/TAZ-Hedgehog signalling axis, and YAP/TAZ could be a novel therapeutic target in PDAC.
