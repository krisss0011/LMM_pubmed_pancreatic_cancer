Background:Gastrointestinal (GI) cancer is associated with a group of cancers affecting the organs in the GI tract, with a high incidence and mortality rate. This type of cancer development involves a series of molecular events that arise by the dysregulation of gene expressions and microRNAs (miRNAs).Objectives:This mini-review focuses on elucidating the mechanism of tumor suppressor miRNA-mediated oncogenic gene silencing, which may contribute to a better understanding of miRNA-mediated gene expression regulation of cell cycle, proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis in GI cancers. In this review, the biological significance of tumor suppressor miRNAs involved in gastrointestinal cancers is briefly explained.Methods:The articles were searched with the keywords 'miRNA', 'gastrointestinal cancers', 'esophageal cancer', 'gastric cancer', 'colorectal cancer', 'pancreatic cancer', 'liver cancer', and 'gall bladder cancer' from the Google Scholar and PubMed databases. A total of 71 research and review articles have been collected and referred for this study.Results:This review summarises recent research enhancing the effectiveness of miRNAs as novel prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic markers for GI cancer treatment strategies. The expression pattern of various miRNAs has been dysregulated in GI cancers, which are associated with proliferation, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion.Conclusion:The role of tumor suppressor miRNAs in the negative regulation of oncogenic gene expression was thoroughly explained in this review. Its potential role as a microRNA therapeutic candidate is also discussed. Profiling and regulating tumor suppressor miRNA expression in gastrointestinal cancers using miRNA mimics could be used as a prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic marker, as well as an elucidating molecular therapeutic approach to tumor suppression.
