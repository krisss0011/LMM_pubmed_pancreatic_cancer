Background:Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients with preoperative carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) serum levels higher than 500 U/ml are classified as biologically borderline resectable (BR-B). To date, the impact of cholestasis on preoperative CA19-9 serum levels in these patients has remained unquantified.Methods:Data on 3079 oncologic pancreatic resections due to PDAC that were prospectively acquired by the German Study, Documentation and Quality (StuDoQ) registry were analyzed in relation to preoperative CA19-9 and bilirubin serum values. Preoperative CA19-9 values were adjusted according to the results of a multivariable linear regression analysis of pathologic parameters, bilirubin, and CA19-9 values.Results:Of 1703 PDAC patients with tumor located in the pancreatic head, 420 (24.5 %) presented with a preoperative CA19-9 level higher than 500 U/ml. Although receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis failed to determine exact CA19-9 cut-off values for prognostic indicators (R and N status), the T, N, and G status; the UICC stage; and the number of simultaneous vein resections increased with the level of preoperative CA19-9, independently of concurrent cholestasis. After adjustment of preoperative CA19-9 values, 18.5 % of patients initially staged as BR-B showed CA19-9 values below 500 U/ml. However, the postoperative pathologic results for these patients did not change compared with the patients who had CA19-9 levels higher than 500 U/ml after bilirubin adjustment.Conclusions:In this multicenter dataset of PDAC patients, elevation of preoperative CA19-9 correlated with well-defined prognostic pathologic parameters. Bilirubin adjustment of CA19-9 is feasible but does not affect the prognostic value of CA19-9 in jaundiced patients.
