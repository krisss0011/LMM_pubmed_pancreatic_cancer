Studies have shown that ferroptosis, an iron-dependent regulated cell death, is related to prognosis and chemotherapy, but the role of ferroptosis in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) is still unclear. We aimed at constructing a ferroptosis-related gene (FRGs) model to predict the PAAD patients' overall survival (OS) and at exploring their values in chemotherapy. We downloaded the mRNA-sequencing data and corresponding clinical data of patients with PAAD from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Lasso-penalized Cox regression analysis was utilized to construct a prognostic risk model, including spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase 1 (SAT1), SAT2, TFRC, SLC39A8, MAP1LC3A, ALOX15, and PROM2. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to evaluate the prognostic model. International Cancer Genome Consortium cohorts were used to validate this model. Then, we used Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer and Gene Expression Omnibus databases to analyze the correlation between FRGs and drug sensitivity. Notably, SAT1 showed significant influence in cisplatin and gemcitabine resistance. Finally, in vitro experiments demonstrated that the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin could induce ferroptosis in AsPC1 cells, probably through elevated SAT1 expression. Taken together, Our 7-gene signature has significant values in predicting the PAAD patients' OS, and it may help inform the clinical treatment of PAAD.
