Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common and difficult to treat form of pancreas cancer. PDAC and other solid cancers contain both tumor cells and normal connective tissue cells called stromal cells, which are responsible for the excess production of extracellular matrix. It is known that in more than 90% of PDAC tumors and in many other types of cancer, mutations of theKRASgene are observed, the reciprocal signaling of which has been shown between tumor and stromal cellsin vitro. Pancreatic stromal stellate cells are considered precursors of activated or tumor-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are an increasing population of cells that proliferatein situor are recruited into the tumor. CAFs are a heterogeneous population of stromal fibroblasts with different molecular profiles that change during tumorigenesis. Both immunosuppressive and immunosuppressive subsets of CAFs can coexist in the stroma of a single tumor. Based on the heterogeneity of the intertumor stroma, attempts are being made to classify PDAC and predict the course of the disease.
