Pancreatic cancer is a disease notorious for its high frequency of recurrence and low survival rate. Surgery is the most effective treatment for localized pancreatic cancer, but most cancer recurs after surgery, and patients die within ten years of diagnosis. The question persists: what makes pancreatic cancer recur and metastasize with such a high frequency? Herein, we review evidence that subclinical dormant pancreatic cancer cells disseminate before developing metastatic or recurring cancer. We then discuss several routes by which pancreatic cancer migrates and the mechanisms by which pancreatic cancer cells adapt. Lastly, we discuss unanswered questions in pancreatic cancer cell migration and our perspectives.
