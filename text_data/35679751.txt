Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive malignancy driven by genetic mutations and/or epigenetic dysregulation. Gemcitabine chemotherapy is the first-line regimen for pancreatic cancer but has limited efficacy. Our previous study revealed the role of SETD2-H3K36me3 loss in the initiation and metastasis of PDAC, but little is known about its role in tumor metabolism. Here, we found that SETD2-deficient PDAC enhanced glycolysis addiction via upregulation of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) to meet its large demand for glucose in progression. Moreover, SETD2 deficiency impaired nucleoside synthesis by directly downregulating the transcriptional level of transketolase (TKT) in the pentose phosphate pathway. The metabolic changes confer SETD2-deficient PDAC cells with increased sensitivity to gemcitabine under glycolysis restriction conditions. Collectively, our study provides mechanistic insights into how SETD2 deficiency reprograms glycolytic metabolism to compensate for insufficient nucleoside synthesis, suggesting that glycolysis restriction combined with gemcitabine might be a potential therapeutic strategy for PDAC patients with SETD2 deficiency.
