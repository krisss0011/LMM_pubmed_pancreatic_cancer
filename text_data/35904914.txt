Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a heterogeneous disease. Undeniably, the appearance and accumulation of genetic mutations promote the development of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. However, counterintuitively, genetic analyzes, no matter how precise and in-depth they may be, do not allow stratification of patients to predict their clinical evolution or to select the most effective treatment in each case. This is due to the fact that the clinical evolution and sensitivity to treatments are associated with the tumoral phenotype, which, in turn, is determined by the global expression of genes that is regulated at the transcriptomic level. Therefore, the stratification of these patients must be done by analysis at the transcriptomic level and not by genetic analysis. The data obtained from large cohorts of patients indicate that studying the transcription of a selected set of genes could predict the clinical outcome and can help to decide about the most appropriate treatment. We are moving very rapidly towards a personalized medicine for this disease, which in itself has a poor prognosis, even worse if the therapeutic decision is not the most adapted to each patient. We are convinced that in the near future the treatment of cancers will be preceded by an extensive transcriptomic characterization in order to select the most suitable "a la carte" treatments.
