Continuous progress in the diagnostics and treatment of neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs), the emerging results of new clinical trials, and the new guidelines issued by medical societies have prompted experts from the Polish Network of Neuroendocrine Tumours to update the 2017 recommendations regarding the management of neuroendocrine neoplasms. This article presents the general recommendations for the management of NENs, resulting from the findings of the experts participating in the Fourth Round Table Conference, entitled "Polish Guidelines for the Diagnostics and Treatment of Neuroendocrine Neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract, Żelechów, June 2021". Drawing from the extensive experience of centres treating these cancers, we hope that we have managed to formulate the optimal method of treating patients with NENs, applying the latest reports and achievements in the field of medicine, which can be effectively implemented in our country. The respective parts of this work present the approach to the management of: NENs of the stomach and duodenum (including gastrinoma), pancreas, small intestine, and appendix, as well as large intestine.
