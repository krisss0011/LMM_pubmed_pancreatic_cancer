Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal cancers largely due to the inefficient delivery of therapeutics. Nanomaterials have been extensively investigated as drug delivery platforms, showing improved drug pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. However, their applications in pancreatic cancer have not yet been successful due to limited tumor delivery caused by dense tumor stroma and distorted tumor vasculatures. Meanwhile, smaller-sized nanomaterials have shown improved tumor delivery and retention in various tumors, including pancreatic tumors, suggesting their potential in enhancing drug delivery. An ultrafine iron oxide nanoparticle (uIONP) was used to encapsulate 7-ethyl-10-hydroxyl camptothecin (SN38), the water-insoluble active metabolite of pancreatic cancer chemotherapy drug irinotecan. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) was conjugated to uIONP as a ligand for targeting pancreatic cancer cells overexpressing IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R). The SN38 loading and release profile were characterized. The pancreatic cancer cell targeting using IGF1-uIONP/SN38 and subsequently induced cell apoptosis were also investigated. IGF1-uIONP/SN38 demonstrated a stable drug loading in physiological pH with the loading efficiency of 68.2 ± 3.5% (SN38/Fe, wt%) and < 7% release for 24 h. In tumor-interstitial- and lysosomal-mimicking pH (6.5 and 5.5), 52.2 and 91.3% of encapsulated SN38 were released over 24 h. The IGF1-uIONP/SN38 exhibited specific receptor-mediated cell targeting and cytotoxicity Ato MiaPaCa-2 and Panc02 pancreatic cancer cells with IC50 of 11.8 ± 2.3 and 20.8 ± 3.5 nM, respectively, but not to HEK293 human embryonic kidney cells. IGF1-uIONP significantly improved the targeted SN38 delivery to pancreatic cancer cells, holding the potential for in vivo theranostic applications.
