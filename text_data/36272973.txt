Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a poor 5-year overall survival rate. Patients with PDAC display limited benefits after undergoing chemotherapy or immunotherapy modalities. Herein, we reveal that chemotherapy upregulates placental growth factor (PlGF), which directly activates cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) to induce fibrosis-associated collagen deposition in PDAC. Patients with poor prognosis have high PIGF/VEGF expression and an increased number of PIGF/VEGF receptor-expressing CAFs, associated with enhanced collagen deposition. We also develop a multi-paratopic VEGF decoy receptor (Ate-Grab) by fusing the single-chain Fv of atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) to VEGF-Grab to target PD-L1-expressing CAFs. Ate-Grab exerts anti-tumor and anti-fibrotic effects in PDAC models via the PD-L1-directed PlGF/VEGF blockade. Furthermore, Ate-Grab synergizes with gemcitabine by relieving desmoplasia. Single-cell RNA sequencing identifies that a CD141+CAF population is reduced upon Ate-Grab and gemcitabine combination treatment. Overall, our results elucidate the mechanism underlying chemotherapy-induced fibrosis in PDAC and highlight a combinatorial therapeutic strategy for desmoplastic cancers.
