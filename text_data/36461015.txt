Background:Less than 11% of pancreatic cancer patients survive 5-years post-diagnosis. The unique biology of pancreatic cancer includes a significant expansion of its desmoplastic tumor microenvironment, wherein cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and their self-produced extracellular matrix are key components. CAF functions are both tumor-supportive and tumor-suppressive, while normal fibroblastic cells are solely tumor-suppressive. Knowing that CAF-eliminating drugs are ineffective and can accelerate cancer progression, therapies that "normalize" CAF function are highly pursued. Eribulin is a well-tolerated anti-microtubule drug used to treat a plethora of neoplasias, including advanced/metastatic cancers. Importantly, eribulin can inhibit epithelial to mesenchymal transition via a mechanism akin to blocking pathways induced by transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ). Notably, canonical TGFβ signaling also plays a pivotal role in CAF activation, which is necessary for the development and maintenance of desmoplasia. Hence, we hypothesized that eribulin could modulate, and perhaps "normalize" CAF function.Methods:To test this premise, we used a well-established in vivo-mimetic fibroblastic cell-derived extracellular matrix (CDM) system and gauged the effects of eribulin on human pancreatic CAFs and cancer cells. This pathophysiologic fibroblast/matrix functional unit was also used to query eribulin effects on CDM-regulated pancreatic cancer cell survival and invasive spread.Results:Demonstrated that intact CAF CDMs modestly restricted eribulin from obstructing pancreatic cancer cell growth. Nonetheless, eribulin-treated CAFs generated CDMs that limited nutrient-deprived pancreatic cancer cell survival, similar to reported tumor-suppressive CDMs generated by TGFβ-deficient CAFs.Conclusions:Data from this study support the central proposed premise suggesting that eribulin could be used as a CAF/matrix-normalizing drug.
