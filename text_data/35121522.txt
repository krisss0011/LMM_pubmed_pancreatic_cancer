Background:Pulmonary metastasis (M1-PUL) as first site of dissemination in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a rare event and may define a distinct biological subgroup.Patients and methods:Arbeitsgemeinschaft Internistische Onkologie-Young Medical Oncologists-Pankreas-0515 study (AIO-YMO-PAK-0515) was a retrospective German multicenter study investigating clinical and molecular characteristics of M1-PUL PDAC patients; 115 M1-PUL PDAC patients from 7 participating centers were included. Clinical characteristics and potential prognostic factors were defined within the M1-PUL cohort. Archival tumor samples were analyzed for Her2/neu, HNF1A and KRT81 expression. Additionally, messenger RNA (mRNA) expression analysis (using a 770-gene immune profiling panel) was carried out in the M1-PUL and in a control cohort (M1-ANY).Results:Median overall survival in the entire M1-PUL cohort was 20 months; the most favorable prognosis (median survival: 28 months) was observed in the subgroup of 66 PDAC patients with metachronous lung metastases after previous curative-intent surgery. The number of metastatic lesions, uni- or bilateral lung involvement as well as metastasectomy were identified as potential prognostic factors. Her2/neu expression and PDAC subtyping (by HNF1A and KRT81) did not differ between the M1-PUL and the M1-ANY cohort. mRNA expression analysis revealed significant differentially expressed genes between both cohorts: CD63 and LAMP1 were among the top 20 differentially expressed genes and were identified as potential mediators of organotropism and favorable survival outcome of M1-PUL patients.Conclusion:M1-PUL represents a clinically favorable cohort in PDAC patients. Site of relapse might already be predetermined at the time of surgery and could potentially be predicted by gene expression profiling.
