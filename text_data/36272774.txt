Background:The Coronavirus pandemic outbreak in 2019 and the saturation of healthcare system led to an increased use of digital tools for surveillance. In this study we described our experience using telemedicine to follow-up on patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms during the COVID-19 era and analyze those factors associated to patients' satisfaction.Methods:This 1-year retrospective observational study enrolled patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms followed-up by telemedicine during COVID-19 outbreak. Patients with high-risk features needing on-site physical examination or declining remote follow-up were excluded. A 13-question survey was conducted; demographic, geographic, and employment information was collected. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate those factors associated to patients' satisfaction.Results:Out of 287, a total of 177 patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms were included: the mean age was 69 (44-87) years and the male/female ratio was 0.78. A total of 80 (45.2%) patients had previously experienced abdominal pain. Most patients (85.3%) were satisfied with telemedicine: at univariate analysis, age â‰¥70 years (P = .007), retirement (P = .001), and absence of previous abdominal pain (P = .05) were significantly associated with patient satisfaction. At multivariate analysis, the absence of previous abdominal pain was the only factor independently associated with patient satisfaction (odds ratio 5.964, 95% confidence interval 2.21-16.11, P < .001).Conclusion:Telemedicine allows a new follow-up strategy that can be used in selected patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms. The absence of previous abdominal pain is associated with patient satisfaction during follow-up. Further studies are needed to evaluate safety of remote follow-up in patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms.
