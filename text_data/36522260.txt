Background:The clinical importance of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) have increased last decades. Long-term survival after resection for invasive IPMN (inv-IPMN) compared to conventional pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is not thoroughly delineated.Objective:This study, based on the Swedish national pancreatic and periampullary cancer registry aims to elucidate the outcome after resection of inv-IPMN compared to PDAC.Methods:All patients â‰¥18 years of age resected for inv-IPMN and PDAC in Sweden between 2010 and 2019 were included. Clinicopathological variables were retrieved from the national registry. The effect on death was assessed in two multivariable Cox regression models, one for patients resected 2010-2015, one for patients resected 2016-2019. Median overall survival (OS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.Results:We included 1909 patients, 293 inv-IPMN and 1616 PDAC. The most important independent predictors of death in multivariable Cox regressions were CA19-9 levels, venous resection, tumour differentiation, as well as T-, N-, M-stage and surgical margin. Tumour type was an independent predictor for death in the 2016-2019 cohort, but not in the 2010-2015 cohort. In Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, inv-IPMN was associated with longer median OS in stage N0-1 and in stage M0 compared to PDAC. However, in stage T2-4 and stage N2 median OS was similar, and in stage M1 even shorter for inv-IPMN compared to PDAC.Conclusion:In this population-based nationwide study, outcome after resected inv-IPMN compared to PDAC is more favourable in lower stages, and similar to worse in higher.
