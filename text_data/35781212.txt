This work describes miRNA-based electrochemical biosensor for detection of miRNA30e, a pancreatic cancer biomarker. The screen-printed gold electrode was functionalized using cysteine hydrochloride followed by immobilization of synthesized colloidal gold nanorods (10-12 nm diameter and 25-65 nm length). The gold nanorods modified electrode surface was amino functionalized for covalent attachment of single-stranded DNA probe against miRNA30e (miR30e). This platform was utilized for electrochemical measurements and response analysis of target miRNA30e. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic measurements showed very poor sensitivity (13.51 Ω/µg/mL/cm2) using charge transfer resistance calibration plots. Cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry-based miR30e quantification showed decreasing current response with increasing concentration of miR30e with detection range of 0.1 fg/mL-0.1 µg/mL (14.9 aM-14.9 nM). The sensitivity of DPV sensing (104.4 µA/µg/mL/cm2) was found to be 1.3 times higher than that of CV-based quantification (79.6 µA/µg/mL/cm2). miRNA-based biosensors have the potential of replacing current invasive, time consuming and technically difficult diagnostic procedures. Furthermore, the lower limit of detection of 14.9 aM miRNA30e makes it a promising tool for detection of cancer at early stages and hence increasing survival rate.
