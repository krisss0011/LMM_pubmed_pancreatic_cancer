The RNA exosome is a multi-subunit ribonuclease complex that is evolutionally conserved and the major cellular machinery for the surveillance, processing, degradation, and turnover of diverse RNAs essential for cell viability. Here we performed integrated genomic and clinicopathological analyses of 27 RNA exosome components across 32 tumor types using The Cancer Genome Atlas PanCancer Atlas Studies' datasets. We discovered that theEXOSC4gene, which encodes a barrel component of the RNA exosome, was amplified across multiple cancer types. We further found thatEXOSC4alteration is associated with a poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients. Moreover, we demonstrated that EXOSC4 is required for the survival of pancreatic cancer cells. EXOSC4 also repressedBIKexpression and destabilizedSESN2mRNA by promoting its degradation. Furthermore, knockdown of BIK and SESN2 could partially rescue pancreatic cells from the reduction in cell viability caused by EXOSC4 knockdown. Our study provides evidence for EXOSC4-mediated regulation ofBIKandSESN2mRNA in the survival of pancreatic tumor cells.
