This work discussed the efficiency of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) as a diagnostic modality for early detection of pancreatic cancer. The present study was constructed by doing imaging modalities EUS on 24 patients admitted to surgery department in the faculty of medicine with suspected pancreatic malignancy. Pancreatic cancer was found more in older ages above 55 years predominately in males coming from rural areas presenting with abdominal pain with or without jaundice. Histopathological examination revealed that ductal adenocarcinoma represented by 70.83% of cases. This study also shows significant elevation in serum CA19-9 in the presenting cases to confirm a close relation between cancer pancreas and CA19-9 as a good biochemical marker for PC. EUS was found to be able to detect masses less than 20 mm in diameter. Moreover, EUS can accurately detect the mass nature. EUS showed correct information as regards lymph node involvement and vascular invasion which affected the results of respectability of pancreatic masses. Finally, this study clearly showed that EUS is an accurate pre-operative tool in the assessment of nodal staging, vascular invasion, and respectability in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
