There are no reliable biomarkers for early diagnosis or prognosis evaluation in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Multiple scRNA-seq datasets for PDAC were retrieved from online databases and combined with scRNA-seq results from our previous study. The malignant ductal cells were identified through calculating copy number variation (CNV) scores. The robust markers of malignant ductal cells in PDAC were found. Five immune-related signatures, including SPP1, LINC00683, SNHG10, LINC00237, and CASC19, were used to develop a risk score formula to predict the overall survival of PDAC patients. We also constructed an easy-to-use nomogram, combining risk score, N stage, and margin status. The expression level of SPP1 was related to the prognosis and immune regulators. We found that SPP1 was mainly expressed in ductal cells and macrophages in PDAC. In conclusion, we constructed a promising prognostic model based on immune-related signatures for PDAC using scRNA-seq and TCGA_PAAD datasets.
