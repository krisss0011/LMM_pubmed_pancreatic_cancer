Objective:To evaluate the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer.Methods:Clinical data of 8 patients underwent laparoscopic surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer at Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center from September 2019 to June 2020 were reviewed retrospectively. There were 5 males and 3 females,aged from 47 to 72 years old. All patients underwent abdominal enhanced CT and PET-CT before operation to accurately evaluate the tumor stage and exclude distant metastasis.Results:Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with AG regimen(gemcitabine 1 000 mg/m2and albumin bound paclitaxel 125 mg/m2) was received for 2 to 6 cycles before surgery. All 8 patients successfully completed the operation,including 5 cases of pancreaticoduodenectomy,2 cases of radical antegrade modular pancreatosplenectomy(RAMPS),and 1 case of total pancreatectomy. No conversion to laparotomy or laparoscopic assisted surgery. The operation time was 240 to 450 minutes,the blood loss was 100 to 500 ml,the postoperative length of stay was 10 to 16 days. During the follow-up period up to December 31, 2020, there was 1 case suffered grade B pancreatic leakage and abdominal infection. The numbers of resected lymph nodes were 9 to 31. All patients received R0 resection. The follow-up times were 4.5 to 9.5 months. One patient underwent RAMPS was diagnosed as liver metastasis after 2 months of the operation,and the other 7 patients still survived without tumor recurrence.Conclusion:Minimally invasive surgery of pancreatic cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is safe and feasible in experienced pancreatic minimally invasive centers.
