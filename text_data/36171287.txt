Recent single-cell studies of cancer in both mice and humans have identified the emergence of a myofibroblast population specifically marked by the highly restricted leucine-rich-repeat-containing protein 15 (LRRC15)1-3. However, the molecular signals that underlie the development of LRRC15+cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and their direct impact on anti-tumour immunity are uncharacterized. Here in mouse models of pancreatic cancer, we provide in vivo genetic evidence that TGFβ receptor type 2 signalling in healthy dermatopontin+universal fibroblasts is essential for the development of cancer-associated LRRC15+myofibroblasts. This axis also predominantly drives fibroblast lineage diversity in human cancers. Using newly developed Lrrc15-diphtheria toxin receptor knock-in mice to selectively deplete LRRC15+CAFs, we show that depletion of this population markedly reduces the total tumour fibroblast content. Moreover, the CAF composition is recalibrated towards universal fibroblasts. This relieves direct suppression of tumour-infiltrating CD8+T cells to enhance their effector function and augments tumour regression in response to anti-PDL1 immune checkpoint blockade. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that TGFβ-dependent LRRC15+CAFs dictate the tumour-fibroblast setpoint to promote tumour growth. These cells also directly suppress CD8+T cell function and limit responsiveness to checkpoint blockade. Development of treatments that restore the homeostatic fibroblast setpoint by reducing the population of pro-disease LRRC15+myofibroblasts may improve patient survival and response to immunotherapy.
