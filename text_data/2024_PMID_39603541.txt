BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided transmural drainage with 
on-demand endoscopic necrosectomy (EN) is increasingly utilized to manage 
walled-off necrosis (WON). It has not been fully elucidated how EN and its 
timing are correlated with treatment outcomes compared to the drainage-based 
approach.
METHODS: Within a multi-institutional cohort of 423 patients with pancreatic 
fluid collections including 227 patients with WON, we identified 153 patients 
who received the step-up treatment following the initial EUS-guided drainage of 
symptomatic WON, including 102 EN patients and 51 non-EN (drainage) patients. 
Using the competing-risks multivariable proportional hazards regression model 
with adjustment for potential confounders, we calculated subdistribution hazard 
ratios (SHRs) for clinical treatment success (WON resolution) by the use of EN 
and its timing.
RESULTS: Compared to drainage alone, the EN-based treatment was associated with 
a shorter time to clinical success with a multivariable SHR of 1.66 (95% 
confidence interval, 1.12-2.46). Despite a higher risk of procedure-related 
bleeding in the EN group, there were no differences in the rates of severe 
adverse events (7.8% vs. 5.9% in the EN and non-EN groups, respectively) and 
mortality (6.9% vs. 9.8%). In the EN-treated patients, the timing of EN was not 
statistically significantly associated with the time to clinical success (Ptrend 
= 0.34) CONCLUSION: Among patients receiving EUS-guided treatment of symptomatic 
WON, the use of EN in addition to drainage procedures was associated with 
earlier disease resolution. Further research is desired to determine the optimal 
timing of initiating EN considering a risk-benefit balance and 
cost-effectiveness.
