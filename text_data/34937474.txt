Introduction:Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a malignant tumor with significantly increased incidence and poor prognosis. Its extremely poor prognosis is generally attributed to its early invasion and metastasis as well as the presence of chemotherapy resistance, which may be related to the potential role of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (Dclk1) has been recognized to be a marker of CSCs in PC, showing intimate association with its occurrence, metastasis, and poor prognosis.Areas covered:A review serves to provide a comprehensive overview of Dclk1 in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment in PC.Expert opinion:Searching for potential key biomarkers for PC has been an urgent issue to be addressed. The expression of Dclk1 is increasing in PC, and its effect is linked to the mutant Kras, supporting that it may be a potential new target. Therefore, it highlights Dclk1 as a candidate biomarker and therapeutic target in future clinical application.
