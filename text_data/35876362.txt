Introduction:Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is an uncommon complication that may occur in cancer patients usually as an expression of cancer-associated coagulopathy or due to drug-related toxicity. The clinical spectrum of TMA may vary from an incidental laboratory finding in cancer outpatients to potentially severe life-threatening clinical forms with organ involvement requiring prompt recognition and multidisciplinary evaluation.Case reports:We present the clinical characteristics and outcomes of four patients with advanced pancreatic cancer with acute non-immune intravascular haemolysis compatible with microangiopathic acute haemolytic anaemia associated with mild thrombocytopenia during long-term gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel treatment.Management and outcomes:Abnormal blood parameters (all four cases) and renal involvement (one case) were reversed with a conservative approach and chemotherapy discontinuation. One patient required a short hospitalization while the other three were managed as outpatients. The rapid reversibility of the blood abnormalities supported gemcitabine dose-related toxicity as the most likely aetiologic mechanism and demonstrates the current challenges in daily long-term cancer survivor care.Discussion:Clinicians must take into account TMA in the differential diagnosis of acute anaemia with or without thrombocytopenia and organ damage, since adequate recognition and early treatment discontinuation allow effective outpatient management and favourable patient outcomes.
