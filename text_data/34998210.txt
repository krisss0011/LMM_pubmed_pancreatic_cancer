Gastrointestinal (GI) cancer has become the primary concern of today's society due to its aggressive nature and poor prognosis. PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), a subgroup of non-coding RNAs, are mainly expressed in the germline and have emerged as a critical regulator in gene expression and the epigenetic silencing of DNA transposable elements by interacting with PIWI proteins. piRNAs' dysregulations were reported to promote or suppress the initiation and development of different malignancies, especially gastrointestinal cancers. Recently, several studies suggested the use of piRNAs as potential cancer biomarkers associated with the progression and chemoresistance of GI cancer. Hence, this review article aims to focus on the role of piRNAs in GI cancer progression, metastasis, and their molecular mechanisms as therapeutic markers for GI cancer patients.
