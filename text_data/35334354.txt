In view of the fact that pancreatic cancer, called as the king of cancer, is one of the most lethal malignancies, exploring effective technologies for pancreatic cancer diagnosis and therapy remains an appealing yet significantly challenging task. Phototheranostics has recently received considerable attention by virtue of its various distinctive advantages. However, the limited penetration depth, strong oxygen-dependence and high heat shock protein-inhibition of conventional phototheranostic materials severely hamper their overall theranostic efficacy, especially for deep-seated hypoxia tumors, such as pancreatic tumor. In this study, an aggregation-induced emission (AIE)-featured photosensitizer, namely DCTBT, synchronously sharing NIR-II fluorescence imaging (FLI), diminished oxygen-dependent type-I photodynamic therapy (PDT) and high-efficiency photothermal therapy (PTT) functions was subtly constructed by molecular engineering. With the aid of an EGFR-targeting-peptide-modified amphiphilic polymer, the as-prepared DCTBT-loaded liposomes is capable of effectively accumulating at and visualizing pancreatic tumor, as well as significantly suppressing the tumor growth on both subcutaneous and orthotopic PANC-1 tumor mice models. This study thus brings useful insights into designing the next generation of cancer theranostic agents for potential clinical applications.
