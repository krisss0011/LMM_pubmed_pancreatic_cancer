Background and objective:An association between body mass index (BMI) and pancreatic cancer is suggested in observational studies. However, further studies are required to substantiate available evidence. The aim of this study was to explore the association between BMI and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) risk, treatment, and mortality.Methods:A registry-based cohort study was performed by combining data from four registries in Norway. Baseline data were collected between 1963 and 1975 with follow-up data collected until 2018. Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariable Cox regressions were estimated. Chi-square tests were used to analyze differences between groups.Results:The study cohort consisted of 1,723,692 individuals. A total of 8973 PDAC cases were identified during 55,744,749 person-years of follow-up. A 5 kg/m2increase in BMI was associated with an increased risk of PDAC if high BMI at young age (16-29 years) (hazard ratio (HR): 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13-1.31), both for men (HR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.15-1.46) and women (HR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.05-1.28). In men, there was a 52% increase in risk of early-onset PDAC (<age 50) (HR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.13-2.03) with 5 kg/m2increase in BMI. A total of 2645 individuals were diagnosed with stage 1-3 disease, of whom 1131 underwent curative surgery. In all, 49% of normal weight, 38% overweight, and 30% obese individuals with stage 1-3 PDAC underwent surgery with curative intent (p < 0.001). Cancer survival was lower in overweight and obese individuals for both sexes. Analysis adjusted for sex, age, and period of diagnosis confirmed increased risk of cancer death in obese individuals.Conclusion:This study suggests that increased BMI in young adults may increase the risk of PDAC, and higher BMI in men is associated with an increased risk of early onset PDAC (<age 50). Overweight and obese individuals were less likely to undergo curative surgery and obese individuals had a higher risk of cancer-related death.
