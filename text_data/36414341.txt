Hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) is a rare B cell malignancy that is associated with the BRAF V600E mutation and has good treatment response to purine analogues. Its presentation synchronously with other malignancies has been rarely reported. Here, we present a patient with HCL with hepatic involvement who was also found to have pancreatic adenocarcinoma concomitantly at the time of diagnosis. Treating these rare cases simultaneously is a challenge clinically. Throughout this case study, we provide our approach on how oncological care teams provided care for this complicated and rare disease state.
