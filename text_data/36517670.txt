Neoplastic cells of non-immunogenic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) express indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO-1), an immunosuppressive enzyme. The metabolites of IDO-1 in cancers provide one-carbon units that annihilate effector T cells, and recruit immunosuppressive cells. In this study we investigated how IDO-1 affected the neoplastic cell behaviors in PDACs. Using multiple markers co-labeling method in 45-µm-thick tissue sections, we showed that IDO-1 expression was uniquely increased in the neoplastic cells extruded from ducts' apical or basal domain, but decreased in lymph metastatic cells. IDO-1+extruding neoplastic cells displayed increased vimentin expression and decreased cytokeratin expression in PDACs, characteristics of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, IDO-1 expression was uncorrelated with immunosuppressive infiltrates and clinicopathological characteristics of grim outcome. We replicated basal extrusion with EMT in murine KPIC PDAC organoids by long-term IFN-γ induction; application of IDO-1 inhibitor INCB24360 or 1-MT partially reversed basal extrusion coupled EMT. Ido-1 deletion in KPIC cells deprived its tumorigenicity in immunocompetent mice, decreased cellular proliferation and macropinocytic ability, and increased immunogenicity. KPIC organoids with IFN-γ-induced basal extrusion did not accelerate distant metastasis, whereas inhibition IFN-γ-induced IDO-1 with INB24360 but not 1-MT in KPIC organoids elicited liver metastasis of subcutaneous KPIC organoid tumors, suggesting that lower IDO-1 activity accelerated distant metastasis, whereas IDO-1 was indispensable for tumorigenicity of PDAC cells and supports the survival of extruding cells.
