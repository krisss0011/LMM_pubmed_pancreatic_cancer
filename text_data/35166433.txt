Alterbrassicicene D (1) and 3(11)-epoxyhypoestenone (2) were synthesised via a two-phase approach featuring concise construction of the 5-8-5 tricyclic intermediate and a tandem base-mediated epoxide opening-transannular oxa-Michael addition cascade to forge the complex skeleton of 2. The route is scalable and we generated 15 g of the tricyclic intermediate in 8 steps from (R)-limonene and 720 mg of the penultimate bioactive intermediate in a protecting-group-free manner. Our synthesis enabled the structural determination of 2 and provided materials for preliminary anticancer evaluation. The penultimate intermediate showed therapeutic potential in terms of its ability to dramatically reduce the tumourigenic potential of PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells according to a limiting dilution tumour-initiating assay. Our synthetic approach will facilitate unified access to naturally occurring fusicoccanes and their derivatives for anticancer evaluation.
