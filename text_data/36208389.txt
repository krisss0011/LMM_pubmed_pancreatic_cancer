Bleeding is a fatal complication after pancreatectomy. Although coil embolization is a widely accepted treatment option, ischemia of the remaining organs should be prevented. This study reports the successful treatment of intra-abdominal hemorrhage following distal pancreatectomy with en bloc celiac axis resection (DP-CAR) using balloon-assisted coil embolization (BACE). A 59-year-old man was diagnosed with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. The tumor involves the common hepatic artery, splenic artery, and celiac artery. After four cycles of treatment with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel, the soft-density masses, surrounding the artery, shrunk. DP-CAR and R0 resections were performed. A minor postoperative pancreatic fistula occurred. Six months postoperatively, the computed tomography showed delayed asymptomatic bleeding from an anterior superior pancreaticoduodenal artery (ASPDA) pseudoaneurysm located near the gastroduodenal artery confluence. BACE was performed by placing a microballoon catheter in the region of confluence of the ASPDA and posterior superior pancreaticoduodenal artery (PSPDA) to prevent coil migration. After inserting the microballoon catheter, coil embolization was performed in the ASPDA. Hepatic blood flow was maintained from the PSPDA. BACE is a useful technique to preserve blood flow to the remnant organs when performing coil embolization for bleeding following a distal pancreatectomy, especially following a DP-CAR.
