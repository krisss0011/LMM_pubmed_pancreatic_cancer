Clustering of supernumerary centrosomes, which potentially leads to cell survival and chromosomal instability, is frequently observed in cancers. However, the molecular mechanisms that control centrosome clustering remain largely unknown. The centrosomal kinesin KIF24 was previously shown to restrain the assembly of primary cilia in mammalian cells. Here, we revealed that KIF24 depletion suppresses multipolar spindle formation by clustering centrosomes in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells harboring supernumerary centrosomes. KIF24 depletion also induced hyper-proliferation and improved mitotic progression in PDAC cells. In contrast, disruption of primary cilia failed to affect the proliferation and spindle formation in KIF24-depleted cells. These results suggest a novel role for KIF24 in suppressing centrosome clustering independent of primary ciliation in centrosome-amplified PDAC cells.
