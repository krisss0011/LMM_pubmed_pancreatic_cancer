Cachexia is an acute syndrome that is very commonly observed in patients with cancer. Cachexia is the number one cause of death in patients with metastatic disease and is also the major factor for physical toxicity and financial burden. More importantly, the majority of patients with advanced-stage pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cancer undergo cachexia. Pancreatic cancer causes deaths of âˆ¼50,000 Americans and about 400,000 people worldwide every year. The high mortality rates in metastatic PDAC are due to systemic pathologies and cachexia, which quickens death in these patients. About 90% of all patients with PDAC undergo wasting of muscle causing mobility loss and leading to a number of additional pathological conditions. PDAC-associated cancer cachexia emanates from complex signaling cues involving both mechanical and biological signals. Tumor invasion is associated with the loss of pancreatic function-induced digestive disorders and malabsorption, which causes subsequent weight loss and eventually promotes cachexia. Besides, systemic inflammation of patients with PDAC could release chemical cues (e.g., cytokine-mediated Atrogin-1/MAFbx expression) that participate in muscle wasting. Our understanding of genes, proteins, and cytokines involved in promoting cancer cachexia has evolved considerably. However, the role of epigenetic factors, particularly the role of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) in regulating PDAC-associated cachexia is less studied. In this review article, the most updated knowledge on the various ncRNAs including microRNAs (miRs), long noncoding RNA (lncRNAs), piwi interacting RNAs (PiwiRNAs), small nucleolar RNA (snoRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNA) and their roles in cancer cachexia are described.
