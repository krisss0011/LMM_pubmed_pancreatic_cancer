A man in his 80s was referred to our hospital for further examination of partial 
pancreatic atrophy that was detected incidentally. Various imaging examinations 
including CT, MRI, and EUS did not reveal any obvious abnormal findings other 
than the partial pancreatic atrophy. However, cytological examination of serial 
pancreatic juice aspiration showed atypical cells. The presence of pancreatic 
intraepithelial carcinoma in the atrophy site was considered, and the patient 
underwent laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy. Pathological examination of the 
excised specimen confirmed the presence of high-grade pancreatic intraepithelial 
neoplasia consistent with the atrophy site, and the patient was diagnosed with 
pTisN0M0, Stage 0 pancreatic cancer. For the detection of early pancreatic 
cancer, it is important to be aware of partial pancreatic atrophy on imaging 
studies.
