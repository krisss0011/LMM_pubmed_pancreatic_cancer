Pancreatic cancer is one of the most serious health issues in developed and developing countries, with a 5-year overall survival rate currently <9%. Patients typically present with advanced disease due to vague symptoms or lack of screening for early cancer detection. Surgical resection represents the only chance for cure, but treatment options are limited for advanced diseases, such as distant metastatic or locally progressive tumors. Although adjuvant chemotherapy has improved long-term outcomes in advanced cancer patients, its response rate is low. So, exploring other new treatments is urgent. In recent years, increasing evidence has shown that lipid metabolism can support tumorigenesis and disease progression as well as treatment resistance through enhanced lipid synthesis, storage, and catabolism. Therefore, a better understanding of lipid metabolism networks may provide novel and promising strategies for early diagnosis, prognosis estimation, and targeted therapy for pancreatic cancer patients. In this review, we first enumerate and discuss current knowledge about the advances made in understanding the regulation of lipid metabolism in pancreatic cancer. In addition, we summarize preclinical studies and clinical trials with drugs targeting lipid metabolic systems in pancreatic cancer. Finally, we highlight the challenges and opportunities for targeting lipid metabolism pathways through precision therapies in pancreatic cancer.
