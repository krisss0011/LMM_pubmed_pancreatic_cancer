The mutant p53Y220C (mutp53Y220C) is frequently observed in numerous tumors, including pancreatic cancer. The mutation creates a crevice in the DNA binding core domain and makes p53 a thermally unstable non-functional protein that assists tumor progression and confers resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. Restoring mutp53 function to its wild type by selectively targeting this crevice with small molecules is a pivotal strategy to promote apoptosis. In this study, we have shown through different biophysical and cell-based studies that curcumin binds and rescues mutp53Y220C to an active wild-type conformation and restores its apoptotic transcription function in BxPC-3-pancreatic cancer cells. In addition, the curcumin-rescued-p53Y220C (CRp53) showed significant hyperphosphorylation at Ser15, Ser20, and acetylation at Lys382 with an 8-fold increase in transcription activity in the BxPC-3 cell lines. We also observed that the active CRp53 escapes Mdm2-mediated proteasomal degradation and the majority of the proteins were localized inside the nucleus with an increased half-life and transcription restoration compared to untreated BxPC-3 cells. By label-free proteomics analysis, we observed that upon curcumin treatment almost 227 proteins were dysregulated with the majority of them being transcriptional targets of p53. Based on our studies, it reflects that apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells is mediated by curcumin-rescued mutant p53Y220C.
