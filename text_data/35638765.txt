Ductal carcinoma of the pancreas (DCP) is one of the most devastating tumors and ranks fourth among the causes of death from cancer. It is estimated that by 2030 it will be among the top three "cancer killers", along with lung cancer and hepatocarcinoma. Overall survival at five years from diagnosis is 5-10% in centers with experience. At the time of diagnosis, only 10-15% of patients present tumors localized to the pancreas and which are susceptible to curative resection (R0) (resectable tumors). Fifty percent present with systemic disease (stage IV) and 30-35% present borderline or locally advanced tumors which are generally not resectable due to vascular invasion.
