Introduction:The COVID-19 pandemic has delayed medical consultation, possibly leading to the diagnosis of gastrointestinal cancer. The aim of the study was to analyze the impact of SARS-Cov-2 pandemic on new diagnosis and short-term survival of patients with pancreatic cancer (PC).Methods:All consecutive patients who had a suspected diagnosis of pancreatic lesion before (from March to September 2019) and during COVID 19 pandemic (from March to September 2020). Demographics, clinical and treatment were collected and compared. Short-term survival was assessed.Results:A total of 25 patients (n=13 men) with diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and a median age of 70 years (IQR 62-74) were included. An increase was observed in the number of patients with newly diagnosed PC (n= 12 [19.1%] versus n=13 [20.9%]; P= 0.603). The subgroup analysis revealed a tendency toward a longer diagnosis (11 versus 12 days; P= 0.219) and treatment (28 versus 44; P= 0.375) delay for patients with PC during COVID-19 pandemic. A significant increase was observed for number of cases of advanced stage III and IV (n=4 [30.8%] versus n=7 [53.8%]; P= 0.006). Palliative treatment was the most frequent approach during COVID-19 period. During 1-year follow-up, 6 (50%) and 7 (61.5%) deaths were observed among patients diagnosed before and after COVID-19 (P= 0.449), respectively.Conclusions:The COVID-19 pandemic has led to delays in diagnosis and treatment in PC, which translates into an advanced staging and a worse prognosis. These data should stimulate health care provider to facilitate procedures for detection pancreatic cancer.
