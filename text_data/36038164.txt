Introduction:There is a paucity of studies about whether dose escalation of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) prolongs survival compared with de-escalation for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). Therefore, the aim of the study is to compare the survival benefits of biologically effective dose (BED10, α/β=10) of 60-70 Gy with those of BED10>70 Gy.Methods and analysis:This study is a single-centre, phase II trial. Patients with LAPC are randomly allocated to receive SBRT with BED10of 60-70 Gy or >70 Gy in 5-6 fractions combined with gemcitabine plus albumin-bound paclitaxel. The primary outcome is progression-free survival. The secondary outcomes are adverse events, local control and overall survival.Ethics and dissemination:The trial protocol has been approved by the Ethics committee of Shanghai Changhai Hospital. The ethics number is CHEC2020-100. Study results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and released in related medical conferences.Trial registration numbers:NCT04603586.
