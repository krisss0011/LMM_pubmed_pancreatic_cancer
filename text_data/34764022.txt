Background:Whether coeliac axis resection (CAR) results from tumour topography or a prognostic factor for distal pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains unclear. We aimed to compare the clinicopathological data between distal pancreatectomy with en bloc CAR (DP-CAR) and distal pancreatectomy plus splenectomy (DP-S) and analyse the prognostic factors.Methods:We retrospectively analysed clinicopathological data from 102 patients who underwent distal pancreatectomy for PDAC and the factors affecting disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Of these patients, 45 and 57 underwent DP-CAR and DP-S, respectively.Results:DP-CAR was associated with more operative challenges than DP-S: more portomesenteric vein resections (48.9% vs. 14.0%), longer operations (320 vs. 242 min), and greater estimated blood loss (EBL) (600 vs. 200 ml). DP-CAR had larger tumours (5 vs. 4 cm), more perineural invasion (91.1% vs. 73.7%), and more microscopically positive surgical margins (20% vs. 3.5%), compared to DP-S. The major complication was clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (20.6%). The median DFS was 15.8 months and the median OS was 20.1 months. CAR was not associated with DFS or OS. EBL>700 ml, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and adjuvant chemotherapy independently affected DFS and OS.Conclusion:DP-CAR was associated with larger tumours and more surgical challenges but not with poorer DFS and OS than DP-S. CAR was more likely to result from tumour topography rather than from an adverse prognostic factor for resected distal PDAC. EBL>700 ml, LVI, and adjuvant chemotherapy were independent factors affecting the survival of patients with distal PDAC who underwent surgical resection.
