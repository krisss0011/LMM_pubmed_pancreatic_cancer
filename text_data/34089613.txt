Objectives:The combination of gemcitabine (Gem) and hypericin (HY) enhances the apoptosis of Capan-2 cells, providing a promising option for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Our study further explored the cytotoxic mechanism of HY combined with chemotherapy drugs on pancreatic cancer.Methods:The proliferation rate of the cells assayed with the MTT method. The ROS (reactive oxygen species) levels of each treatment were evaluated by DCFH-DA oxidisation methods. The activity of glutathione reductase and the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidised glutathione (GSSG) were assessed using assay kits. The expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins were analysed by western blotting.Key findings:The activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), a key enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway, significantly decreased in Gem + HY groups, however, the ROS level enhanced accompanying with GSH depleting, mitochondrial membrane depolarisation and cytochrome C release. Gem + HY inhibits the expression of Bcl-2 but stimulates Bax level, triggering caspase activation and PARP cleavage and thus promoted apoptosis of Capan-2 cells.Conclusions:We demonstrated that Gem combined HY-PDT could inhibit the proliferation of Capan-2 cells and induce cell apoptosis. HY-PDT combined with Gem had a great potential on pancreatic cancer treatment clinically.
