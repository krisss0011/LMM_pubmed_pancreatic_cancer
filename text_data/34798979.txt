Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly lethal cancer and projected to be the second leading cause of cancer death by 2030. Multigene panel testing has facilitated the identification of germline variants associated with an increased risk of PC. Precision treatment has led to improved outcomes for patients with these findings. Because of these improved outcomes as well as the implications for at-risk family members who may benefit from additional cancer screening, the NCCN recommends universal genetic testing for newly diagnosed PC patients. This review describes the most common heritable conditions associated with PC and those who may benefit from screening.
