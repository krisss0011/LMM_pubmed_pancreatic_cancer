Backgroud:Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly invasive malignancy with extremely poor prognosis. STK31 has been identified as a cancer-testis (CT) gene, but its function in PC has not been elucidated well.Methods:The effect of STK31 on cell proliferation, migration and invasion was investigated by in vitro and in vivo experiments and total RNA sequencing and targeted bisulfite sequencing was applied to explore the potential regulatory mechanisms of STK31 in PC.Results:By analysis of tissue samples and the clinicopathologic features, we found that STK31 was reactivated in PC and associated with poor prognosis. In addition, the vitro and vivo studies indicated that STK31 could promote PC progression by facilitating cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and the indication. Targeted Bisulfite Sequencing showed that STK31 was regulated by methylation. Furthermore, the results of total RNA sequencing suggested that STK31 was closely related to signal transduction, metabolism, and the immune system.Conclusions:This study demonstrates that STK31, as a CT gene, can promote the development of PC and is regulated by methylation. STK31 could be considered as a potential therapeutic target for PC.
