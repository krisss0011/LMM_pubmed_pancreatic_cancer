Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN) constitute about 2% of all malignant neoplasms and their incidence is increasing. The wide spectrum of malignancy and diversity cause that symptoms of NEN are often nonspecific and the diagnosis is made at an advanced stage of the disease.Aim:The aim of this study was to assess the awareness of specialists from different disciplines about the specificity of NEN, which is crucial for establishing a prompt and correct diagnosis of the disease.Materials and methods:The study involved collecting and summarizing information on the path of a patient with NEN obtained by completing a questionnaire by physicians of various specialties working in centers throughout Poland.Results:Questionnaires were completed by 39 respondents, predominantly oncologists, surgeons, and gastroenterologists. Their responses helped to define the patient's pathway through early NEN diagnosis and provide details on the management in clinical practice both at suspicion of NEN and after NEN diagnosis.Conclusions:The results of the study present the current state of early NEN diagnosis in Poland and are another step towards improving diagnostics in this direction, which will enable earlier diagnosis of NENs and rapid implementation of treatment of affected patients.
