The present cross-sectional prospective study (from January 2017 until December 2020) aimed to evaluate the interrelation between nutritional parameters at the initial evaluation with the changes in QOL indicators and the Progression-Free Survival and Overall Survival in 97 patients with pancreatic cancer. Dietary and nutritional risk assessments, and an evaluation of Frailty and Functional Status were performed. Health-related Quality of Life was evaluated with the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Nutritional risk, as evaluated by MNA-SF score, was negatively associated with age (p = 0.003) and positively associated with dynamometry (p = 0.001). In addition, there was a statistically significant difference in the financial difficulties (p = 0.049). OS and PFS were found to decrease in patients who reported having increased fatigue (OS p = 0.007 and PFS p = 0.044). Moreover, higher prevalence of constipation resulted in lower OS and PFS (OS p < 0.001 and PFS p < 0.001) and increased reporting of gastrointestinal problems during the 3 months was connected with lower survival (OS p = 0.017). According to the analysis, our patients were found to have lower OS and PFS, stressing out the necessity to provide early identification and management to symptoms of the disease that could compromise nutritional status. The provision of nutritional advice and guidance is of major importance for patients.
