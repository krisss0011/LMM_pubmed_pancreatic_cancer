One concern associated with pancreatic diseases is the poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer. Even with advances in diagnostic modalities, risk stratification of premalignant lesions and differentiation of pancreatic cysts are challenging. Pancreatic lesions of concern include intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, mucinous cystic neoplasms, serous cystadenomas, pseudocysts, and retention cysts, as well as cystic degeneration of solid tumors such as solid pseudopapillary neoplasms and pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms. Pancreatic juice obtained during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography has previously been used for the detection of KRAS mutation. Recently, duodenal fluid, which can be obtained during the relatively minimally invasive procedures of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and cyst fluid collected by EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) were used for molecular biological analysis. Furthermore, advanced analytic methods with high sensitivity were used for the detection of single and multiple markers. Early detection of malignant pancreatic tumors and risk stratification of premalignant tumors can be performed using duodenal fluid samples with a single marker with high sensitivity. Technological advances in simultaneous detection of multiple markers allow for the differentiation of cystic pancreatic tumors. One thing to note is that the clinical guidelines do not recommend pancreatic cyst fluid and pancreatic juice (PJ) sampling by EUS-FNA and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, respectively, in actual clinical practice, but state that they be performed at experienced facilities, and duodenal fluid sampling is not mentioned in the guidelines. With improved specimen handling and the combination of markers, molecular markers in PJ samples may be used in clinical practice in the near future.
