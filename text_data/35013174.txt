Immune evasion is indispensable for cancer initiation and progression, although its underlying mechanisms in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are not fully known. Here, we characterize the function of tumor-derived PGRN in promoting immune evasion in primary PDAC. Tumor- but not macrophage-derived PGRN is associated with poor overall survival in PDAC. Multiplex immunohistochemistry shows low MHC class I (MHCI) expression and lack of CD8+T cell infiltration in PGRN-high tumors. Inhibition of PGRN abrogates autophagy-dependent MHCI degradation and restores MHCI expression on PDAC cells. Antibody-based blockade of PGRN in a PDAC mouse model remarkably decelerates tumor initiation and progression. Notably, tumors expressing LCMV-gp33 as a model antigen are sensitized to gp33-TCR transgenic T cell-mediated cytotoxicity upon PGRN blockade. Overall, our study shows a crucial function of tumor-derived PGRN in regulating immunogenicity of primary PDAC.
