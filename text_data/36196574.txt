In this issue, Abrego and colleagues describe an unexpected role for the mitochondrial enzyme glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT2) in pancreatic cancer, whereby it acts as a nuclear fatty acid transporter binding to and activating the PPARδ nuclear receptor. In turn, the GOT2-PPARδaxis drives immunosuppression by suppressing T cell-mediated antitumor immunity. See related article by Abrego et al., p. 2414 (3).
