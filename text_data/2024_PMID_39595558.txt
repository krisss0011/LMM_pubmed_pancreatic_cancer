Familial pancreatic cancer (FPC) represents a significant yet underexplored area 
in pancreatic cancer research. Basic research efforts are notably limited, and 
when present, they are predominantly centered on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations 
due to the scarcity of other genetic variants associated with FPC, leading to a 
limited understanding of the broader genetic landscape of FPC. This review 
examines the current state of FPC research, focusing on the molecular mechanisms 
driving pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) progression. It highlights the 
role of homologous recombination (HR) and its therapeutic exploitation via 
synthetic lethality with PARP inhibitors in BRCA1/2-deficient tumors. The review 
discusses various pre-clinical models of FPC, including conventional 
two-dimensional (2D) cell lines, patient-derived organoids (PDOs), 
patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), and genetically engineered mouse models 
(GEMMs), as well as new advancements in FPC research.
