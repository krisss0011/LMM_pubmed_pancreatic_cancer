Purpose:One of the obstacles to the application of Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) and Proton Boron Fusion Therapy (PBFT) concerns the measurement of borated carriers' biodistribution. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro internalization of the19F-labelled p-boronophenylalanine (19F-BPA) in the human cancer pancreatic cell line (PANC-1) for the potential application of BNCT and PBFT in pancreatic cancer. The19F-BPA carrier has the advantage that its bio-distribution may be monitored in vivo using19F-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (19F NMR).Materials and methods:The19F-BPA internalization in PANC-1 cells was evaluated using three independent techniques on cellular samples left in contact with growing medium enriched with 13.6 mM19F-BPA corresponding to a11B concentration of 120 ppm: neutron autoradiography, which quantifies boron; liquid chromatography hyphenated to tandem mass spectrometry and UV-Diode Array Detection (UV-DAD), which quantifies19F-BPA molecule; and19F NMR spectroscopy, which detects fluorine nuclei.Results:Our studies suggested that19F-BPA is internalized by PANC-1 cells. The three methods provided consistent results of about 50% internalization fraction at 120 ppm of11B. Small variations (less than 15%) in internalization fraction are mainly dependent on the proliferation state of the cells.Conclusions:The ability of19F NMR spectroscopy to study19F-BPA internalization was validated by well-established independent techniques. The multimodal approach we used suggests19F-BPA as a promising BNCT/PBFT carrier for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Since the quantification is performed at doses useful for BNCT/PBFT,19F NMR can be envisaged to monitor19F-BPA bio-distribution during the therapy.
