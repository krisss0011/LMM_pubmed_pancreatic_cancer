Background:B7 molecules play significant roles in regulating tumor immunity, but their expression patterns and immuno-biological correlations in pancreatic cancer (PaCa) have not been fully discussed.Methods:RNA-sequencing data of B7 molecules of PaCa samples in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset was downloaded from the UCSC Xena to assess the expression, correlation, and mutation of the B7 family in PaCa. Next, two PaCa tissue microarrays (TMAs, Cat. HPanA150CS02 and HPanA120Su02) were obtained from Outdo BioTech (Shanghai, China). To detect the expression levels of PD-L1, B7-H3 and B7-H4, immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was performed on these TMAs.Results:Most B7 molecules, including B7-1, B7-2, PD-L1, B7-DC, B7-H2, and B7-H5 exhibited similar expression patterns, but B7-H3, B7-H4, B7-H6, and B7-H7 showed outlier expression patterns compared with other B7 molecules. Besides, B7 molecules were genetically stable and exhibited low alteration frequency. IHC staining indicated PD-L1, B7-H3, and B7-H4 were up-regulated in PaCa tissues and showed uncorrelated expression patterns. Furthermore, high expression of PD-L1 and B7-H3 indicated poor-differentiated grades in PaCa. PD-L1 was positively, but B7-H4 was negatively correlated with CD8+ TILs infiltration in PaCa. Moreover, combined PD-L1 and B7-H4 expression was a novel subtyping strategy in PaCa, namely patients with both high PD-L1 and B7-H4 expression exhibited decreased CD8+ TILs infiltration in tumor tissues.Conclusion:Overall, we systemically analyzed the expression patterns of B7 molecules and proposed a novel subtyping strategy in PaCa. Patients with both high PD-L1 and B7-H4 expression exhibited the immuno-cold phenotype, which may be not suitable for immunotherapy.
