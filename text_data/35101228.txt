Mutational activation of the KRAS oncogene is found in ~95% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the major form of pancreatic cancer. With substantial experimental evidence that continued aberrant KRAS function is essential for the maintenance of PDAC tumorigenic growth, the National Cancer Institute has identified the development of effective anti-KRAS therapies as one of four major initiatives for pancreatic cancer research. The recent clinical success in the development of an anti-KRAS therapy targeting one specific KRAS mutant (G12C) supports the significant potential impact of anti-KRAS therapies. However, KRASG12Cmutations comprise only 2% of KRAS mutations in PDAC. Thus, there remains a dire need for additional therapeutic approaches for targeting the majority of KRAS-mutant PDAC. Among the different directions currently being pursued for anti-KRAS drug development, one of the most promising involves inhibitors of the key KRAS effector pathway, the three-tiered RAF-MEK-ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. We address the promises and challenges of targeting ERK MAPK signaling as an anti-KRAS therapy for PDAC. In particular, we also summarize the key role of the MYC transcription factor and oncoprotein in supporting ERK-dependent growth of KRAS-mutant PDAC.
