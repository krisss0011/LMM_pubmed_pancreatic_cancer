Due to challenges in early-stage detection, aggressive behavior, and poor response to systemic therapy, pancreatic cancer is one of the most fatal cancer types globally. The role of RNA-binding protein (RBP) transcription and translation of cancer cells has been well demonstrated, although their roles in pancreatic cancer is less well understood. In this study, we found that heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (hnRNPC), a RBP, is highly expressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tissues and cells. In addition, we discovered that overexpression of hnRNPC in PDAC cellsin vitroincreased cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis. The presence of hnRNPC promoted tumorigenesis of pancreatic cells in metastaticin vivomodels, which was also validated.In silicoanalyses revealed that hnRNPC is a strong positive regulator of IQ Motif Containing GTPase Activating Protein 3 (IQGAP3) activity. The experimental confirmation of this association revealed a direct interaction of IQGAP3 and hnRNPC to induce cell growth and invasion in PDAC cells by activating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In light of the findings that hnRNPC accelerates PDAC progression by interfering with IQGAP3, it appears that this technique for diagnosis and treatment of PDAC may have promise.
