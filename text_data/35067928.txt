Gastrinomas are gastrin-secreting pancreatic tumours rarely diagnosed in cats. A 12-year-old female spayed cat was presented for vomiting, anorexia and weight loss. Physical exam revealed lethargy, dehydration and thin body condition. Pertinent laboratory abnormalities included a mild mature neutrophilia and borderline hypoalbuminaemia. Imaging of the abdomen revealed a mass-like change to the proximal duodenum. Exploratory laparotomy was performed, and the duodenal mass along with a 3-mm pancreatic nodule was removed. Immunohistochemical staining of the pancreatic nodule confirmed a gastrinoma. Following surgery, treatment was initiated with omeprazole and toceranib. Toceranib was discontinued after 8 weeks due to hyporexia. The patient was continued on omeprazole long term and has survived more than 35 months since diagnosis. Little information regarding treatment and prognosis for feline gastrinomas is available. In this case report, long-term survival was achieved with a combined surgical and medical approach using omeprazole and toceranib.
