Pancreatic cancer is a deadly disease that is increasing in incidence throughout the world. There are no clear causal factors associated with the incidence of pancreatic cancer; however, some correlation to smoking, diabetes and alcohol has been described. Recently, a few studies have linked the human microbiome (oral and gastrointestinal tract) to pancreatic cancer development. A perturbed microbiome has been shown to alter normal cells while promoting cancer-related processes such as increased cell signaling, immune system evasion and invasion. In this article, we will review in detail the alterations within the gut and oral microbiome that have been linked to pancreatic cancer and explore the ability of other microbiomes, such as the lung and skin microbiome, to contribute to disease development. Understanding ways to identify a perturbed microbiome can result in advancements in pancreatic cancer research and allow for prevention, earlier detection and alternative treatment strategies for patients.
