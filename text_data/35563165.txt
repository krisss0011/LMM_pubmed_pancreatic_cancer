Chemo-resistance challenges the clinical management of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). A limited admittance of chemotherapeutics to PDAC tissues is a key obstacle in chemotherapy of the malignancy. An enhanced uptake of drugs into PDAC cells is required for a more effective treatment. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), especially small EVs (sEVs), have emerged as drug carriers for delivering chemotherapeutics due to their low immunogenicity and propensity for homing toward tumor cells. The present study evaluated sEVs derived from six different human cell lines as carriers for paclitaxel (PTX). The encapsulation of the chemotherapeutics was achieved using incubation, sonication and electroporation. The cytotoxicity of the EV drugs was evaluated by MTS assay. While sonication led to a higher efficiency of drug loading than incubation and electroporation, PTX loaded through incubation with HPNE-derived sEVs (HI-PTX) was the most efficacious in killing PDAC cells. Furthermore, HI-PTX was taken up by PDAC cells more efficiently than other EV drugs, implying that the efficacy of HI-PTX is associated with its efficient uptake. This was supported by the observation that the cytotoxicity and uptake of HI-PTX is mediated via the clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Our results indicate that the hTERT-HPNE cell-derived EVs are effective drug carriers to enhance paclitaxel's efficacy in PDAC cells.
