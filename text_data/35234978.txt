Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive solid tumors and still has a poor prognosis. A delayed diagnosis at advanced stages and a poor response to systemic treatment frequently make a curative treatment impossible. Therefore, the identification of high-risk patients and screening them regularly is the most promising approach to improve the prognosis. Chronic pancreatitis as well as neoplastic pancreatic cysts can greatly increase the risk of developing pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, familial syndromes and germline mutations also confer an increased risk for development of pancreatic cancer. This article provides an overview of the various premalignant diseases of the pancreas. The value of the various imaging modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging and endosonography are particularly discussed as well as the screening interval and the indications for surgical treatment are explained.
