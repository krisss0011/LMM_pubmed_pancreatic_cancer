Objective:Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has the characteristics of high-density desmoplastic stroma, a distinctive immunosuppressive microenvironment and is profoundly resistant to all forms of chemotherapy and immunotherapy, leading to a 5-year survival rate of 9%. Our study aims to add novel small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of PDAC.Design:We have studied whether TAK-981, a novel highly selective and potent small molecule inhibitor of the small ubiquitin like modifier (SUMO) activating enzyme E1 could be used to treat a preclinical syngeneic PDAC mouse model and we have studied the mode of action of TAK-981.Results:We found that SUMOylation, a reversible post-translational modification required for cell cycle progression, is increased in PDAC patient samples compared with normal pancreatic tissue. TAK-981 decreased SUMOylation in PDAC cells at the nanomolar range, thereby causing a G2/M cell cycle arrest, mitotic failure and chromosomal segregation defects. TAK-981 efficiently limited tumour burden in the KPC3 syngeneic mouse model without evidence of systemic toxicity. In vivo treatment with TAK-981 enhanced the proportions of activated CD8 T cells and natural killer (NK) cells but transiently decreased B cell numbers in tumour, peripheral blood, spleen and lymph nodes. Single cell RNA sequencing revealed activation of the interferon response on TAK-981 treatment in lymphocytes including T, B and NK cells. TAK-981 treatment of CD8 T cells ex vivo induced activation of STAT1 and interferon target genes.Conclusion:Our findings indicate that pharmacological inhibition of the SUMO pathway represents a potential strategy to target PDAC via a dual mechanism: inhibiting cancer cell cycle progression and activating anti-tumour immunity by inducing interferon signalling.
