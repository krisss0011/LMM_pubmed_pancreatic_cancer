An 81-year-old woman who had undergone total thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid cancer 12 years earlier was found to have a tumor in the tail of the pancreas. Four years earlier, skin, lung, and mediastinal lymph node metastases had appeared. Computed tomography (CT) showed a mass 26 mm in diameter in the tail of the pancreas. Thereafter, the pancreatic tumor increased in size, while the lung metastases remained stable. Unenhanced CT at the time of first detection showed that the tumor was heterogeneous, with low-attenuation areas indicating fat components. As the tumor grew, the fat components became unclear. Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy were performed. The tumor was diagnosed as dedifferentiated liposarcoma with a well-differentiated liposarcoma component at the tumor margin. The pancreas is an extremely rare site of primary liposarcoma. In the present case, a pancreatic liposarcoma appeared during follow-up of thyroid cancer, and the changes over time were able to be observed with CT.
