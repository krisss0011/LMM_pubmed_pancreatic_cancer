Pancreatic cancer is a lethal malignancy and only around 4% of patients will live 5 years post-diagnosis. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising strategy for treating malignant tumors because of its high selectivity. Through the colocalization of light, oxygen and photosensitizer, a large number of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated under excitation at a specific wavelength of a laser, which can induce DNA damage and destroy cancer cells. However, the repair mechanism of cell will repair part of the damaged DNA, which could reduce the efficiency of PDT. The poly (ADP-Ribose) polymerase (PARP) plays a wide and multifaceted role in the cellular response to DNA damage, with growing evidence for participation in multiple pathways of DNA damage repair and genome maintenance. Cells require PARP to resolve single-strand DNA breaks (SSBs) induced by chemotherapy agents. Its inhibition is thought to result in the accumulation of damage in DNA, which may eventually lead to cell death. The combination therapy of PDT and PARP inhibitors may benefit patients. In this study, we design and synthesize a zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) to co-deliver DNA damaging agent Chlorin e6 (Ce6) and PARP inhibitor Olaparib (Ola). Ce6 and Ola demonstrate strong synergistic actions, providing a novel approach for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
