BACKGROUND: There is limited data with regard to the use of modified 
5-fluoroural-leucovorin-irinotecan-oxaliplatin (mFOLFIRINOX) in terms of 
tolerance and enabling total mesorectal excision (TME) of locally advanced 
rectal adenocarcinomas (LARC) with high-risk characteristics (T4b status, signet 
ring histology etc) post standard neoadjuvant long course chemoradiation 
(NACTRT) or short course radiation (SCRT) and chemotherapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with LARC from January 2018 to December 2020 
receiving mFOLFIRINOX post NACTRT/SCRT to facilitate TME were evaluated. The 
primary endpoint was assessment of grade 3 and grade 4 treatment related 
toxicity and TME rates. Event free survival (EFS), where event was defined as 
disease progression or recurrence post resection after mFOLFIRINOX, was 
calculated by Kaplan Meier method.
RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were evaluated with a median age of 33 years 
(Range:18-59), 45% T4b status, 96% radiological circumferential margin (CRM) 
involved (79% CRM positive post NACTRT/SCRT), 43% extramural venous invasion 
(n=33) and 36% signet ring histology. 62% had received prior NACTRT and 38% had 
received SCRT with chemotherapy before receiving mFOLFIRINOX. The most common 
grade 3 and grade 4 treatment related side effects included diarrhoea (7%), 
anaemia (4%) and infections (4%). Intended duration of mFOLFIRINOX or beyond was 
completed in 94% of patients. 60% of patients underwent curative local resection 
with R0 resection rates of 100% (n=28) and pathological complete response rates 
of 21%. The most common surgeries done were exenterations and abdominoperineal 
in 22% and 17% patients respectively. With a median follow up of 19 months, 24 
patients had recurred or progressed for a median EFS of 20 months [95% 
confidence interval (CI): 15-24].
CONCLUSIONS: Locally advanced rectal cancers with high-risk characteristics are 
a niche group of cancers with less-than-optimal outcomes post standard 
neoadjuvant strategies. mFOLFIRINOX appears to be well tolerated and enables TME 
in a significant proportion of these patients.
