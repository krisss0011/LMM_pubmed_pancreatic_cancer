Digitoxin has repeatedly shown to have negative effects on cancer cell viability; however, the actual mechanism is still unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of digitoxin (1-100 nM) in four pancreatic cancer cell lines, BxPC-3, CFPAC-1, Panc-1, and AsPC-1. The cell lines differ in their KRAS/BRAF mutational status and primary tumor or metastasis origin. We could detect differences in the basal rates of cell proliferation, glycolysis, and ROS production, giving the cell lines different phenotypes. Digitoxin treatment induced apoptosis in all four cell lines, but to different degrees. Cells derived from primary tumors (Panc-1 and BxPC-3) were highly proliferating with a high proportion of cells in the S/G2 phase, and were more sensitive to digitoxin treatment than the cell lines derived from metastases (CFPAC-1 and AsPC-1), with a high proportion of cells in G0/G1. In addition, the effects of digitoxin on the rate of glycolysis, ROS production, and proliferation were dependent on the basal metabolism and origin of the cells. The KRAS downstream signaling pathways were not altered by digitoxin treatment, thus the effects exerted by digitoxin were probably disconnected from these signaling pathways. We conclude that digitoxin is a promising treatment in highly proliferating pancreatic tumors.
