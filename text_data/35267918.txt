The Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria recommends using race- and sex-adjusted cutoff values for reduced muscle mass (RMM), but the only cutoff values available for Asians are the skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) established by the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS). This retrospective study aimed to develop and validate cutoff values for the fat-free mass index (FFMI) and arm circumference (AC) of Asians, and to investigate the association between GLIM malnutrition and prognosis. A total of 660 patients with primary gastrointestinal (GI) and hepatobiliary-pancreatic (HBP) cancers who underwent their first resection surgery were recruited and randomly divided into development and validation groups. The FFMI and AC cutoff values were calculated by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for the AWGS SMI as the gold standard. The cutoff values for each RMM were used to diagnose malnutrition on the basis of GLIM criteria, and the survival rates were compared. The optimal FFMI cutoff values for RMM were 17 kg/m2for men and 15 kg/m2for women, and for AC were 27 cm for men and 25 cm for women. In the validation group, the accuracy of the FFMI and AC cutoff values to discriminate RMM were 85.2% and 68.8%, respectively. Using any of the three measures of RMM, overall survival rates were significantly lower in the GLIM malnutrition group. In conclusion, the cutoff values for the FFMI and AC in this study could discriminate RMM, and GLIM malnutrition using these cutoff values was associated with decreased survival.
