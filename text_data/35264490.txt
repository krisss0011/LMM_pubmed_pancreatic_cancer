A 57-year-old male patient with unresectable pancreatic head cancer was treated with chemotherapy, 5 courses of gemcitabine plus nab paclitaxel therapy, and 9 courses of gemcitabine monotherapy. After 12 months of treatment, he was admitted to our hospital with headache and dyspnea. He was diagnosed with gemcitabine-induced thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) due to acute kidney dysfunction, hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Gemcitabine was discontinued, and symptoms were improved without using hemodialysis and plasma exchange. After his renal function recovered, we started S-1 chemotherapy. Eighteen months later, the patient was alive. Looking back, we realized that fragment red blood cells appeared in complete blood count and serum LDH elevated at 5 months prior to admission, serum creatinine level increased slowly at 4 months prior to admission, and blood pressure elevated significantly at 2 months prior to admission. Therefore, physicians must be aware of TMA as a possible adverse event to gemcitabine. As in this case, hemolytic findings and hypertension in patients treated with gemcitabine may help early detection of TMA.
