Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) is a highly heterogeneous and immunosuppressive cancer. This study investigated the diversity of DNA damage repair (DDR) and immune microenvironment in PAAD by transcriptomic and genomic analysis. Patients with PAAD were divided into two DDR-based subtypes with distinct prognosis and molecular characteristics. The differential expression genes were mostly enriched in DDR and immune-related pathways. In order to distinguish high- and low-risk groups clinically, a DDR- and immune-based 5-gene prognostic signature (termed DPRS) was established. Patients in the high-risk group had inferior prognosis, a low level of immune checkpoint gene expression and low sensitivity to DDR-associated inhibitors. Furthermore, single-cell sequencing was used to observe the performance of the DDR-based signature in a high dimension, and immunohistochemistry was used to verify the relationship between the genes we identified and the prognosis of patients with PAAD. In conclusion, the DDR heterogeneity of PAAD was demonstrated, and a novel DDR- and immune-based risk-scoring model was constructed, which indicated the feasibility of DPRS in predicting prognosis and drug response in PAAD patients.
