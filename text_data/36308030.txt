The spatial configuration of cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) affects both cancer and fibroblast cell phenotypes contributing to the clinical challenge of tumor heterogeneity and therapeutic resistance. This is a particular challenge in stroma-rich pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Here, a versatile system is described to study the impact of tissue architecture on cell phenotype using PDAC as a model system. This fully human system encompassing both primary pancreatic stellate cells and primary organoid cells using the TRACER platform to allow the creation of user-defined TME architectures that have been inferred from clinical PDAC samples and are analyzed by CyTOF to characterize cells extracted from the system. High dimensional characterization using CyTOF demonstrates that tissue architecture leads to distinct hypoxia and proliferation gradients. Furthermore, phenotypic markers for both cell types are also graded in ways that cannot be explained by either hypoxia or coculture alone. This demonstrates the importance of using complex models encompassing cancer cells, stromal cells, and allowing control over architecture to explore the impact of tissue architecture on cell phenotype. It is anticipated that this model will help decipher how tissue architecture and cell interactions regulate cell phenotype and hence cellular and tissue heterogeneity.
