Background:African Americans have the highest pancreatic cancer incidence of any racial/ethnic group in the United States. The oral microbiome was associated with pancreatic cancer risk in a recent study, but no such studies have been conducted in African Americans. Poor oral health, which can be a cause or effect of microbial populations, was associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer in a single study of African Americans.Methods:We prospectively investigated the oral microbiome in relation to pancreatic cancer risk among 122 African-American pancreatic cancer cases and 354 controls. DNA was extracted from oral wash samples for metagenomic shotgun sequencing. Alpha and beta diversity of the microbial profiles were calculated. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between microbes and pancreatic cancer risk.Results:No associations were observed with alpha or beta diversity, and no individual microbial taxa were differentially abundant between cases and control, after accounting for multiple comparisons. Among never smokers, there were elevated ORs for known oral pathogens: Porphyromonas gingivalis (OR = 1.69, 95% CI: 0.80-3.56), Prevotella intermedia (OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 0.69-2.85), and Tannerella forsythia (OR = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.66-2.77).Conclusions:Previously reported associations between oral taxa and pancreatic cancer were not present in this African-American population overall.
