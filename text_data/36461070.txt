Nuclear organisation and architecture are essential for the maintenance of genomic integrity as well as for the epigenetic regulations and gene expression. Disruption of lamin B1, major structural and functional member of the nuclear lamina, is observed in human laminopathies and in sporadic cancers, and leads to chromosomal rearrangements and alterations of gene expression. The tumour suppressor p53 has been shown to direct specific transcriptional programmes by regulating lamin A/C, however its relationship with lamin B1 has remained elusive. Here, we show that loss of p53 correlates with increased expression of members belonging to the nuclear pore complex and nuclear lamina and directly regulates transcription of lamin B1. We show that the genomic loci of a fraction of p53-dependent genes physically interact with lamin B1 and Nup210. This observation provides a possible mechanistic explanation for the p53-depedent changes of chromatin accessibility, with the consequent influence of expression and rearrangement of these genomic sites in pancreatic cancer. Overall, these data suggest a potential functional and biochemical regulatory network connecting p53 and nuclear architecture.
