Objectives:The study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of microRNA compared with carbohydrate antigen 19-9, abdominal ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, endoscopic ultrasound, computed tomography, positron emission tomography, and no screening for pancreatic cancer (PC) screening in patients with diabetes.Methods:We developed a state-transition model from a health care payer perspective and a lifetime horizon. We targeted 3 hypothetical cohorts of patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes (LSD), new-onset diabetes (NOD), and LSD having intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), aged 40, 50, 60, and 70 years. The main outcomes were costs, quality-adjusted life-years, life expectancy life-years, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, and deaths from PC.Results:In the base-case analysis, abdominal ultrasound in patients with LSD and microRNA in patients with NOD and LSD having IPMN were the most cost-effective for all age groups. Cost-effectiveness was sensitive to PC incidence and the cost of microRNA. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that microRNA was 42% to 54% cost-effective for NOD and 76% to 78% cost-effective for LSD having IPMN at a willingness-to-pay level of US $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. MicroRNA prevented 30,641 PC deaths in diabetic patients compared with no screening.Conclusions:In patients with NOD and LSD having IPMN, microRNA-based PC screening is cost-effective and recommended for early PC detection.
