Pancreatic cancer is known as the " king of cancer" . The incidence and mortality of pancreatic cancer are increasing year by year worldwide. The prognosis of pancreatic cancer is very poor, and the effect of existing diagnosis and treatment methods is limited. The Oncologist Branch of the Chinese Medical Doctor Association, the Pancreatic Disease Special Committee of the China International Exchange and Promotive Association for Medical and Health Care, and the Abdominal Tumor Special Committee of the China Medical Education Association convened relevant experts to put forward useful suggestions for clinical reference on nine aspects of home management of patients with pancreatic cancer, including condition communication, follow-up, nutritional support, cancer pain management, psychological adjustment, ascites management, jaundice management, and daily food management. The aim is to improve the quality of life and prolong the survival time of patients with pancreatic cancer.
