Therapeutic success in the treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is hindered by the extensive stroma associated to this disease. Stroma is composed of cellular and non-cellular components supporting and evolving with the tumor. One of the most studied mediators of cancer cell-stroma crosstalk is sonic hedgehog (SHh) pathway leading to the intense desmoplasia observed in PDAC tumors. Herein, we demonstrate that the use of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) containing an SHh inhibitor, cyclopamine (CyP), and the combination of chemotherapeutic drugs (Gemcitabine (Gem)/cisplatin (cisPt)) as the main delivery system for the sequential treatment led to the reduction in tumor stroma along with an improvement in the treatment of PDAC. We synthesized two versions of the MSN-based platform containing the SHh inhibitor (CyP-MSNs) and the drug combination (PEG-Gem-cisPt-MSNs). In vitro and in vivo protein analysis show that CyP-MSNs effectively inhibited the SHh pathway. In addition, the sequential combination of CyP-MSNs followed by PEG-Gem-cisPt-MSNs led to effective stromal modulation, increased access of secondary PEG-Gem-cisPt-MSNs at the tumor site, and improved therapeutic performance in HPAF II xenograft mice. Taken together, our findings support the potential of drug delivery using MSNs for stroma modulation and to prevent pancreatic cancer progression.
