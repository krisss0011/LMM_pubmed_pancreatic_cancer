In laparoscopic surgery, intraabdominal examination is occasionally difficult 
due to restriction of operative field and palpation. This is a case report of a 
jejunal ectopic pancreas which was incidentally found during laparoscopic 
surgery. A 49-year- old male underwent endoscopic mucosal resection for a rectal 
polyp which pathologically resulted in 5,000 μm invasion in submucosa and 
lymphatic invasion. Laparoscopic low anterior resection was planned for the 
patient as an additional treatment. During the surgery, irregular shaped 
tumor-like lesion was incidentally found in jejunum which was located 30 cm 
distal side from the ligament of Treitz. Partial resection of jejunum was also 
performed for pathological diagnosis. Resected jejunal lesion was pathologically 
diagnosed as an ectopic pancreas of Heinrich classification type Ⅰ. Ectopic 
pancreas is defined as pancreatic tissue which is discontinuous to pancreas, 
asymptomatic in most cases, but some reported cases of pancreatitis, forming 
fistula or cancerous change. Reporting with some literature review.
