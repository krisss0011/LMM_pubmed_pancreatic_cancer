Due to its rising incidence, pancreatic neoplasia, which mainly include adenocarcinomas, neuroendocrine and cystic neoplasia of the pancreas, is becoming increasingly relevant in everyday clinical practice.Based on a systematic literature search, a working group of pancreatic experts developed evidence-based recommendations for surgical indications in pancreatic neoplasia to improve the quality.There is a clear surgical indication for primary or secondary resectable pancreatic carcinomas without metastasis, for functionally active, symptomatic and functionally inactive neuroendocrine neoplasia of more than 2 cm in size and for cystic neoplasm with symptoms or signs of malignancy including all intraductal papillary-mucinous neoplasia (IPMN) of the main duct and mixed type, all mucinous-cystic neoplasia (MCN) > 4 cm and all solid pseudopapillary neoplasia (SPN). Surgery can be indicated for pancreatic carcinomas with isolated arterial vascular infiltration or for long periods of stable oligometastasis, regarding neuroendocrine neoplasias for metastasis or debulking surgery as well as for branch-duct IPMN with risk criteria and MCN <4 cm. There is no primary indication for surgery in locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer or asymptomatic serous-cystic neoplasia (SCN).The indication for surgery should always be individualized taking into account age, comorbidities and patient wishes.
