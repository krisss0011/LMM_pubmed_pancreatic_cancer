Virtual screening identified N-(6-((4-bromobenzyl)amino)hexyl)-3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzenesulfonamide (1) a lead compound that bound to the S100A2-p53 binding groove. S100A2 is a Ca2+binding protein with implications in cell signaling and is known to be upregulated in pancreatic cancer. It is a validated pancreatic cancer drug target. Lead 1, inhibited the growth of the MiaPaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cell line (GI50= 2.97 μM). Focused compound libraries were developed to explore the SAR of this compound class with 4 libraries and 43 compounds total. Focused library (Library 1) development identified lipophillic sulfonamides as preferred for MiaPaCa-2 activity, with -CF3and -C(CH3)3substituents well tolerated (MiaPaCa-2 GI50< 6 μM). Contraction of the hexylamino spacer to ethyl (Library 2) and propyl (Library 3) proved beneficial to activity against a broad spectrum panel of cancer cell lines: HT29 (lung), MCF-7 (breast), A2780 (ovarian), H460 (colon), A431 (skin), Du145 (prostate), BE2-C (neuroblastoma), U87 and SJ-G2 (glioblastoma) (cohort-1); and a pancreatic cancer cell line panel: MiaPaCa-2, BxPC-3, AsPC-1, Capan-2, HPAC and PANC-1 (cohort-2). With a marked preference for a propyl linker the observed GI50values ranged from 1.4 to 30 μM against cohort-1 and 1.4-30 μM against cohort-2 cell lines. In Library 4 the terminal aromatic moiety was explored with 4-substituted analogues preferred (with activity of 48 (4-Cl) > 47 (3-Cl) > 46 (2-Cl)) against the cell lines examined. The introduction of bulky aromatic moieties was well tolerated, e.g. dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxine (51) returned cohort-2 GI50values of 1.2-3.4 μM. In all instances the observed docked binding poses and binding scores were consistent with the observed cytotoxicity. This in turn supports, but does not prove, that these analogues function via S100A2-p53 binding groove inhibition.
