Background:Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive cancers with poor survival. The dense desmoplastic stroma in PDAC contributes to treatment resistance. Among the components comprising the tumor stroma, hyaluronan (HA) has been demonstrated to play a critical role in tumor progression and survival. Previous preliminary studies have suggested differences in HA expression in primary and metastatic foci of PDAC. However, the effects of treatment and location of HA expression as a biomarker signature remain unknown; this study sought to compare HA expression in primary and metastatic sites of PDAC.Methods:Tissue from primary and metastatic PDACs were obtained from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center along with associated clinical data. Tissue slides were stained for H&E, HA, and CD44. Associations between HA levels and the evaluated variables were examined including progression free survival and overall survival.Results:HA score was significantly higher in primary PDACs compared to sites of metastases (p = 0.0148). Within the metastases, HA score was significantly higher in liver metastases compared to metastases at other sites (p = 0.0478). In the treatment-naive liver metastasis cohort, patients with HA high status had decreased progression free survival and overall survival compared to patients with HA low status (p = 0.0032 and p = 0.0478, respectively).Conclusions:HA score is variable between primary PDAC, PDAC metastatic to the liver, and PDAC metastatic to other sites. Within liver metastases, patients with HA high status had decreased progression free survival and overall survival compared to patients with HA low status. HA levels can serve as a potential biomarker to guide pancreatic cancer treatments and trial design for agents targeting the stroma.
