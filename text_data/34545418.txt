Background:The present systematic review aimed to compare survival outcomes of invasive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IIPMNs) treated with adjuvant chemotherapy versus surgery alone and to identify pathologic features that may predict survival benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.Method:A systematic search of MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE was performed using the PRISMA framework. Studies comparing adjuvant chemotherapy and surgery alone for patients with IIPMNs were included. Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). A narrative synthesis was performed to identify pathologic features that predicted survival benefits from adjuvant chemotherapy.Results:Eleven studies and 3393 patients with IIPMNs were included in the meta-analysis. Adjuvant chemotherapy significantly reduced the risk of death in the overall cohort (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.38-0.87, p = 0.009) and node-positive patients (HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.13-0.64, p = 0.002). Weighted median survival difference between adjuvant chemotherapy and surgery alone in node-positive patients was 11.6 months (95% CI 3.83-19.38, p = 0.003) favouring chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy had no impact on OS in node-negative patients (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.20-1.43, p = 0.209). High heterogeneity (I2> 75%) was observed in pooled estimates of hazard ratios. Improved OS following adjuvant chemotherapy was reported for patients with stage III/IV disease, tumour size > 2 cm, node-positive status, grade 3 tumour differentiation, positive margin status, tubular carcinoma subtype, and presence of perineural or lymphovascular invasion.Conclusion:Adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with improved OS in node-positive IIPMNs. However, the findings were limited by marked heterogeneity. Future large multicentre prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings and explore additional predictors of improved OS to guide patient selection for adjuvant chemotherapy.
