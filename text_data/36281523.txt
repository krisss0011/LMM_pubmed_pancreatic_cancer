Background:The data on metastatic tumors to the pancreas diagnosed by fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy is limited. We report our experience of FNA of primary and secondary pancreatic tumors emphasizing metastatic breast cancer in the pancreas.Method:Total 274 cases of pancreatic FNA in 10 years were retrospectively reviewed. Literature review of metastatic breast cancers to the pancreas was performed.Results:Out of the 274 cases, 7 (7/274, 2.6%) cases were non-diagnostic, 46 (46/274, 16.8%) cases were negative for malignancy, and 40 (40/274, 14.6%) cases were under the category of atypical cells. There were 133 (133/274, 48.5%) cases diagnosed as positive for malignancy, 20 (20/274, 7.3%) suspicious for malignancy, and 28 (28/274, 10.2%) cases in the category of neoplastic: other. The most common neoplasm diagnosed was ductal adenocarcinoma (114/274, 41.6%; 114/133, 85.7% in positive for malignancy category). Ten cases (10/274, 3.7%) were diagnosed as metastatic neoplasms to the pancreas, including four breast infiltrating ductal carcinomas (IDC), one endocervical adenocarcinoma, one anal/rectal squamous cell carcinoma, one renal cell carcinoma, one hepatocellular carcinoma, one seminoma and one lung adenocarcinoma. We summarized the biomarkers of the four metastatic breast cancers and conducted literature review on biomarkers of metastatic breast cancers to the pancreas.Conclusions:Upon analyzing FNAs of primary and secondary tumors in the pancreas, we have found breast carcinoma is the most common secondary pancreatic neoplasm in our patient population. Triple negative breast ductal carcinoma is the most common tumor among the metastasis of breast carcinomas to the pancreas. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first report with a literature review focusing on biomarkers of metastatic breast cancer to the pancreas.
