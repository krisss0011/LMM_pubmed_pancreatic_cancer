Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death, with a 5-year survival rate of 10%. A stagnant high mortality rate over the last decades highlights the need for innovative therapeutic approaches. Pancreatic tumors pursue an altered metabolism in order to maintain energy generation under low nutrient influx and hypoxic conditions. Targeting these metabolic strategies might therefore be a reasonable therapeutic approach for pancreatic cancer. One promising agent is CPI- 613, a potent inhibitor of two enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The present study evaluated the anti-cancerous efficacy of CPI-613 in combination with galloflavin, a lactate dehydrogenase inhibitor or with alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, an inhibitor of monocarboxylate transporters. The efficacy of both combination therapies was tested in vitro on one human and two murine pancreatic cancer cell lines and in vivo in an orthotopic pancreatic cancer model. Tumor progression was evaluated by MRI and 18F-FDG PET-CT. Both combinatorial treatments demonstrated in vitro a significant inhibition of pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and induction of cell death. In contrast to the in vitro results, both combination therapies did not significantly reduce tumor growth in vivo. The in vitro results suggest that a combined inhibition of different metabolic pathways might be a promising approach for cancer therapy. However, the in vivo experiments indicate that applying a higher dosage or using other drugs targeting these metabolic pathways might be more promising.
