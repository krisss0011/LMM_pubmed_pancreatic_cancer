In many types of cancer, tumor cells prefer to use glycolysis as a major energy acquisition method. Here, we found that the18fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT)-based markers were positively associated with the expression of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), both of which indicate poor prognosis in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, the regulatory mechanism of PD-L1 remains elusive. In this study, we confirmed that transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1) secreted by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) was a key factor contributing to the expression of PD-L1 in PDAC cells by inducing the nuclear translocation of PKM2. Using co-immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we demonstrated that the interaction between PKM2 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) was enhanced by TGF-β1 stimulation, which facilitated the transactivation of PD-L1 by the binding of PKM2 and STAT1 to its promoter. In vivo, PKM2 knockdown decreased PD-L1 expression in PDAC cells and inhibited tumor growth partly by promoting natural killer cell activation and function, and the combination of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade with PKM2 knockdown limited tumor growth. In conclusion, PKM2 significantly contributes to TAM-induced PD-L1 overexpression and immunosuppression, providing a novel target for immunotherapies for PDAC.
