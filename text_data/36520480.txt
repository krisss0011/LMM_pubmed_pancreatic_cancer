Aim:Chemotherapy is standard before and/or after pancreatic cancer resection, yet benefits of pre-resection chemotherapy are unclear. Real-world pre- and post-resection treatment patterns were evaluated retrospectively.Methods:Neoadjuvant (3-months pre-surgery) and adjuvant (6-months post-surgery) treatment claims from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2019 in US adults with resectable pancreatic cancer were analyzed.Results:Of the 737 patients, 29% received no chemotherapy in either setting; 22% received chemotherapy in both settings. In the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings, 69 and 33% of patients, respectively, received no treatment at all. FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine monotherapy were the most common chemotherapies in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings, respectively. Adjuvant FOLFIRINOX increased post-2018, whereas gemcitabine-based regimens decreased.Conclusion:Several chemotherapy regimens were used in both settings. Treatment patterns differed between the two settings.
