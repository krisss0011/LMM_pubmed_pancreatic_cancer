Introduction: Pancreatic cancer is a severe oncological disease with an ever-increasing incidence and a high rate of morbidity and mortality. Therapeutic options are limited and the five-year overall survival rate is 7â€“20%, depending on the possibility of surgical resection and the earliness of detection. Most patients with this diagnosis die due to the resistance of tumour cells and their microenvironment to the used treatment regimes. Methods: In our study, we focused on the implementation of two in vivo models, which are the cell-line derived xenograft (CDX) and the patient-derived xenograft (PDX). These two models differ significantly from each other methodologically, technically, financially, but also in their achieved results. Results: In a pilot study, we managed to successfully implement the CDX model with a very aggressive and resistant PaCa-44 line of pancreatic cancer in a total of 30 NU/NU strain mice. Furthermore, we created three PDX models with various subtypes of pancreatic cancer from patients operated at the University Hospital Kralovske Vinohrady, Department of General Surgery. These tumours were re-transplanted into subsequent generations of 23 individuals of NOD/SCID strain and 47 NU/NU strain mice. The established CDX and PDX models are then used to compare conventional and experimental chemotherapy regimens. Conclusion: The next steps will be to evaluate the effects of treatment regimens by using imaging and molecular genetic methods and to optimise the entire process for further use in precise personalised medicine for patients with pancreatic cancer. The upcoming goal is to create a library of PDX models of the most common pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and other rare subtypes of pancreatic cancer.
