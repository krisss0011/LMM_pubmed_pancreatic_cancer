Inducing the deficiency of homologous recombination (HR) repair is an effective strategy to broaden the indication of PARP inhibitors in pancreatic cancer treatment. Repression of BRD4 has been reported to significantly elevate HR deficiency and sensitize cancer cells to PARP1/2 inhibitors. Inspired by the concept of synthetic lethality, we designed, synthetized and optimized a dual PARP1/BRD4 inhibitor III-7, with a completely new structure and high selectivity against both targets. III-7 repressed the expression and activity of PARP1 and BRD4 to synergistically inhibit the malignant growth of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Based on the results of bioinformatic analysis, we found that Olaparib induced the acceleration of mitosis and recovery of DNA repair to cause the generation of drug resistance. III-7 reversed Olaparib-induced adaptive resistance and induced cell cycle arrest and DNA damage by perturbing PARP1 and BRD4-involved signaling pathways. We believe that the PARP1/BRD4 dual inhibitors are novel and promising antitumor agents, which provide an efficient strategy for pancreatic cancer treatment.
