Introduction:Neoadjuvant therapy (NT) is increasingly used for localized pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The impact of care fragmentation during NT on the outcomes of patients with PDAC is unknown.Methods:Adult patients with Stage I-III PDAC who received NT and patients who underwent surgery first followed by adjuvant therapy (AT) between 2004 and 2016 were queried from the National Cancer Database. Short- and long-term outcomes were compared between patients who received fragmented care (FC; care provided at >1 hospital) versus integrated care (IC; care at a single institution).Results:Among 6522 patients who underwent NT before pancreatectomy, 3755 (57.6%) received FC and 2767 (42.4%) received IC. While patients who received FC had a longer time to initiation of treatment (33.2 vs. 29.7 days, p < 0.001), there was no difference in median overall survival (OS) (26.7 vs. 26.5 months, p = 0.6). Among patients who underwent upfront surgery followed by AT (n = 15 291), patients who received FC had a longer time from diagnosis to undergoing surgery but less time from surgery to AT and no difference in OS (24.0 vs. 24.0 months, p = 0.910).Conclusion:Although care fragmentation was associated with slightly longer times to initiate and complete treatment among patients with localized PDAC, long-term survival outcomes were similar.
