Background:Pancreatic tumors in children and adolescents are rare entities that can stay asymptomatic for long periods. They often become apparent as incidental findings or due to clinical symptoms, like abdominal pain. Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms of the pancreas (SPN) are rare representatives of this group, being low-grade malignant processes and requiring radical surgical treatment. We present four cases of SPN with different diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.Methods:A retrospective analysis of four cases of SPN treated between 2015 and 2020 was performed.Results:Four female patients (11-17 years) were found to have SPN during diagnostic procedures. Three of them were located in the pancreatic head. Histological confirmation was obtained with endosonographic-, CT-guided and open biopsy, respectively. R0 resection was achieved by a pylorus preserving, partial duodenopancreatectomy according to Traverso-Longmire. In one patient the tumor was located in the pancreatic tail with tumor adherence to the splenic vessels. A CT guided biopsy confirmed an SPN. A distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy was performed. Follow-up (6 months - 6 years) revealed no evidence of tumor recurrence, metastasis, or pancreoprive diabetes.Conclusion:For the treatment plan preoperative histological confirmation of SPN is necessary. Based on the tailored diagnostic and operative concepts, treatment at a center with a specialized pediatric surgery, pediatric oncology, pediatric gastroenterology, pediatric radiology and pathology is mandatory.
