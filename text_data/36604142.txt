Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (pNET) is the second most common malignant tumors of the pancreas. Multiple endocrine neoplasia 1 (MEN1) is the most frequently mutated gene in pNETs and MEN1-encoded protein, menin, is a scaffold protein that interacts with transcription factors and chromatin-modifying proteins to regulate various signaling pathways. However, the role of MEN1 in lipid metabolism has not been studied in pNETs. In this study, we perform targeted metabolomics analysis and find that MEN1 promotes the generation and oxidation of polyunsaturated fat acids (PUFAs). Meanwhile lipid peroxidation is a hallmark of ferroptosis, and we confirm that MEN1 promotes ferroptosis by inhibiting the activation of mTOR signaling which is the central hub of metabolism. We show that stearoyl-coA desaturase (SCD1) is the downstream of MEN1-mTOR signaling and oleic acid (OA), a metabolite of SCD1, recues the lipid peroxidation caused by MEN1 overexpression. The negative correlation between MEN1 and SCD1 is further verified in clinical specimens. Furthermore, we find that BON-1 and QGP-1 cells with MEN1 overexpression are more sensitive to everolimus, a widely used drug in pNETs that targets mTOR signaling. In addition, combined use everolimus with ferroptosis inducer, RSL3, possesses a more powerful ability to kill cells, which may provide a new strategy for the comprehensive therapy of pNETs.
