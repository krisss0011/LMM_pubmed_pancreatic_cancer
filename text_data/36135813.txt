Background:Annually, approx. 4000 patients are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in Poland, and the number of deaths is close to the number of diagnoses. Such a high morbidity/mortality ratio is caused by a high percentage of unresectable lesions (about 80%) and chemoresistance, which, among other things, is due to the specific desmoplastic environment. Currently, there are 2 main systemic treatment regimens for pancreatic cancer: FOLFIRINOX (which is a combination of folic acid, fluorouracil (5-FU), irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) and combined treatment with nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine (NPXL+GMC).Objectives:In order to increase the effectiveness of systemic treatments for individual patients, cell lines derived from resected pancreatic tumors were developed and their chemosensitivity to various agents was examined. The hypothesis was that patients may benefit from individualization of chemotherapy.Material and methods:Patients with histopathologically confirmed pancreatic cancer were operated on using irreversible electroporation (IRE) procedure. After isolating and establishing individual cell lines, chemosensitivity to 5-FU, GMC and NPXL was determined using MTT assay in primary and metastatic cell cultures.Results:Three primary cell lines were isolated for the prediction of chemosensitivity. Gemcitabine was shown to be more effective at lower doses compared to 5-FU, while NPXL was more effective than 5-FU, and both of these were less effective in metastatic cells. Pancreatic cancer cell chemoresistance was confirmed in stage IV.Conclusion:Determination of chemosensitivity profiles using cell lines may help in the selection of systemic treatments for individual patients. This method can be the basis for a personalized planned chemotherapeutic protocol.
