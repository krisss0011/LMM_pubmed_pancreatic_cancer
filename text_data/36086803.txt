BACKGROUND Distal pancreatectomy with en bloc celiac artery resection (DP-CAR) is a curative surgical method for locally advanced pancreatic body cancer; however, arterial reconstruction remains controversial in this procedure. This report presents the case of a 47-year-old man with advanced distal pancreatic carcinoma and initial partial response to chemotherapy who required celiac axis reconstruction of the common hepatic artery and left gastric artery. CASE REPORT A 47-year-old man had loss of appetite. He had a 40-mm hypovascular tumor extending from the pancreatic body to the tail, invading around the celiac artery, common hepatic artery, left gastric artery, and splenic artery. We initiated chemotherapy concurrent with chemo-radiotherapy with S-1 administration. After chemo-radiotherapy, computed tomography (CT) showed tumor shrinkage, indicating partial response, but soft tissue CT density surrounding the celiac axis arteries persisted. We conducted conversion surgery. When the common hepatic artery was clamped during surgery, the intrahepatic arterial blood flow reduced; thus, we reconstructed the middle hepatic artery to the common hepatic artery. The left gastric artery was also reconstructed using the second jejunal artery to prevent ischemic gastropathy. Histopathologic examination showed no tumor cells in the specimen; thus, R0 resection was achieved. CONCLUSIONS Arterial reconstruction can be an option for R0 resection in DP-CAR when hepatic arterial blood flow is reduced due to an intraoperative common hepatic artery clamping test.
