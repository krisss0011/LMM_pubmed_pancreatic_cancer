Background:As a malignant tumor, pancreatic cancer has an extremely low overall 5-year survival rate. Pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma (PASC), a rare pancreatic malignancy, owns clinical presentation similar to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which is the most prevalent pancreatic cancer subtype. PASC is generally defined as a pancreatic tumor consisting mainly of adenocarcinoma tissue and squamous carcinoma tissue. Compared with PDAC, PASC has a higher metastatic potential and worse prognosis, and lacks of effective treatment options to date. However, the pathogenesis and treatment of PASC are not yet clear and are accompanied with difficulties.Conclusion:The present paper systematically summarizes the possible pathogenesis, diagnosis methods, and further suggests potential new treatment directions through reviewing research results of PASC, including the clinical manifestations, pathological manifestation, the original hypothesis of squamous carcinoma and the potential regulatory mechanism. In short, the present paper provides a systematic review of the research progress and new ideas for the development mechanism and treatment of PASC.
