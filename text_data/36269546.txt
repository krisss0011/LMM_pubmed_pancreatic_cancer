Purpose:Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NEN) form a rare and remarkably heterogeneous group of tumors. Therefore, establishing personalized therapies is eminently challenging. To achieve progress in preclinical drug development, there is an urgent need for relevant tumor models.Methods:We successfully established three gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (GEP-NET) cell lines (NT-18P, NT-18LM, NT-36) and two gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma (GEP-NEC) cell lines (NT-32 and NT-38). We performed a comprehensive characterization of morphology, NET differentiation, proliferation and intracellular signaling pathways of these five cell lines and, in addition, of the NT-3 GEP-NET cell line. Additionally, we conducted panel sequencing to identify genomic alterations suitable for mutation-based targeted therapy.Results:We found that the GEP-NEN cell lines exhibit a stable neuroendocrine phenotype. Functional kinome profiling revealed a higher activity of serine/threonine kinases (STK) as well as protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) in the GEP-NET cell lines NT-3 and NT-18LM compared to the GEP-NEC cell lines NT-32 and NT-38. Panel sequencing revealed a mutation in Death Domain Associated Protein (DAXX), sensitizing NT-18LM to the Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR) inhibitor Berzosertib, and a mutation in AT-Rich Interaction Domain 1A (ARID1A), sensitizing NT-38 to the Aurora kinase A inhibitor Alisertib. Small interfering RNA-mediated knock down of DAXX in the DAXX wild type cell line NT-3 sensitized these cells to Berzosertib.Conclusions:The newly established GEP-NET and GEP-NEC cell lines represent comprehensive preclinical in vitro models suitable to decipher GEP-NEN biology and pathogenesis. Additionally, we present the first results of a GEP-NEN-specific mutation-based targeted therapy. These findings open up new potentialities for personalized therapies in GEP-NEN.
