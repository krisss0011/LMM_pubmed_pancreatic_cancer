Objectives:Nab-paclitaxel has radiosensitizing antitumor efficacy in pancreatic cancer. We aimed to establish maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of nab-paclitaxel with radiotherapy in unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer.Methods:In a phase I dose escalation trial patients received weekly nab-paclitaxel for 6 weeks with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). 3 + 3 design was used with nab-paclitaxel doses: 25 mg/m 2 (cohort 1), 50 mg/m 2 (cohort 2), 75 mg/m 2 (cohort 3), and 100 mg/m 2 (cohort 4). Primary endpoint was MTD. Secondary objectives were progression-free survival and overall survival.Results:Fourteen patients were recruited. Median age was 69 years (range, 40-86). Grade 1/2 toxicities were nausea (93%), vomiting (54%), diarrhea (57%), and fatigue (69%). There were no dose limiting toxicities (DLT) in cohorts 1 to 3. In cohort 4, DLTs of febrile neutropenia and enterocolitis were observed in patient 1. Subsequent DLT of febrile neutropenia and enterocolitis occurred in patient 5 in the expanded cohort. Following chemoradiotherapy median progression-free survival was 4.7 months (95% confidence interval, 2.5-27.5) and median overall survival was 10.8 months (95% confidence interval, 6.37-25.2).Conclusions:Nab-paclitaxel and EBRT was well-tolerated at doses below 100 mg/m 2 . The MTD and recommended phase II study dose for nab-paclitaxel with EBRT is 75 mg/m 2 in this disease.
