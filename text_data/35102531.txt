Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a disease with a survival rate of 9%; this is due to its chemoresistance and the large tumour stroma that occupies most of the tumour mass. It is composed of a large number of cells of the immune system, such as Treg cells, tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs), myeloid suppressor cells (MDCs) and tumour-associated neutrophiles (TANs) that generate an immunosuppressive environment by the release of inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, cancer-associated fibroblast (CAFs) provide a protective coverage that would difficult the access of chemotherapy to the tumour. According to this, new therapies that could remodel this heterogeneous tumour microenvironment, such as adoptive T cell therapies (ACT), immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), and CD40 agonists, should be developed for targeting PDA. This review organizes the different cell populations found in the tumour stroma involved in tumour progression in addition to the different therapies that are being studied to counteract the tumour.
