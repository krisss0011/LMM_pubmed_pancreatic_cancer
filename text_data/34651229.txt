Purpose:Diagnosis of lymph node metastasis (LNM) is critical for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We aimed to build deep learning radiomics (DLR) models of dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) to classify LNM status of PDAC and to stratify the overall survival before treatment.Methods:From August 2016 to October 2020, 148 PDAC patients underwent regional lymph node dissection and scanned preoperatively DECT were enrolled. The virtual monoenergetic image at 40 keV was reconstructed from 100 and 150 keV of DECT. By setting January 1, 2021, as the cut-off date, 113 patients were assigned into the primary set, and 35 were in the test set. DLR models using VMI 40 keV, 100 keV, 150 keV, and 100 + 150 keV images were developed and compared. The best model was integrated with key clinical features selected by multivariate Cox regression analysis to achieve the most accurate prediction.Results:DLR based on 100 + 150 keV DECT yields the best performance in predicting LNM status with the AUC of 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85-0.89) in the test cohort. After integrating key clinical features (CT-reported T stage, LN status, glutamyl transpeptadase, and glucose), the AUC was improved to 0.92 (95% CI: 0.91-0.94). Patients at high risk of LNM portended significantly worse overall survival than those at low risk after surgery (P = 0.012).Conclusions:The DLR model showed outstanding performance for predicting LNM in PADC and hold promise of improving clinical decision-making.
