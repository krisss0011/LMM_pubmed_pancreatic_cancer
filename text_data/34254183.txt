Background and aims:Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is frequently used for the preoperative histologic diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. However, debate continues regarding the clinical merits of preoperative EUS-FNA for the management of resectable pancreatic cancer. We aimed to evaluate the benefits and safety of preoperative EUS-FNA for resectable distal pancreatic cancer.Methods:The medical records of 304 consecutive patients with suspected distal pancreatic cancer who underwent EUS-FNA were retrospectively reviewed to evaluate the clinical benefits of preoperative EUS-FNA. We also reviewed the medical records of 528 patients diagnosed with distal pancreatic cancer who underwent distal pancreatectomy with or without EUS-FNA. The recurrence rates and cancer-free survival periods of patients who did or did not undergo preoperative EUS-FNA were compared.Results:The diagnostic accuracy of preoperative EUS-FNA was high (sensitivity, 87.5%; specificity, 100%; positive predictive value 100%; accuracy, 90.7%; negative predictive value, 73.8%). Among patients, 26.7% (79/304) avoided surgery based on the preoperative EUS-FNA findings. Of the 528 patients who underwent distal pancreatectomy, 193 patients received EUS-FNA and 335 did not. During follow-up (median 21.7 months), the recurrence rate was similar in the two groups (EUS-FNA, 72.7%; non-EUS-FNA, 75%; P = 0.58). The median cancer-free survival was also similar (P = 0.58); however, gastric wall recurrence was only encountered in the patients with EUS-FNA (n = 2).Conclusion:Preoperative EUS-FNA is not associated with increased risks of cancer-specific or overall survival. However, clinicians must consider the potential risks of needle tract seeding, and care should be taken when selecting patients.
