Purpose:To compare the outcomes of laparoscopic radical antegrade modular pancreatosplenectomy (L-RAMPS) with those of open RAMPS (O-RAMPS) in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).Methods:We reviewed, retrospectively, the medical records of 50 patients who underwent RAMPS for PDAC without resection of major vessels and adjacent organs between 2007 and 2019, and analyzed the relationship between the operative method and surgical and oncological outcomes.Results:Nineteen of the 50 patients underwent L-RAMPS and 31 patients underwent O-RAMPS. L-RAMPS was associated with significantly less blood loss (P = 0.034) but a longer operative time (P = 0.001) than O-RAMPS. There were no significant differences in patient characteristics, tumor factors, or postoperative course; or in the rates of recurrence-free survival (P = 0.084) or overall survival (P = 0.402) between the L-RAMPS and O-RAMPS groups.Conclusion:L-RAMPS for PDAC resulted in less blood loss but a longer operative time than O-RAMPS. Although L-RAMPS may be feasible, the operative time needs to be reduced by standardizing the procedure.
