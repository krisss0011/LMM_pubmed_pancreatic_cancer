Male gonadal metastases from pancreatic carcinomas are extremely rare, with fewer than 20 cases documented in the literature. Herein, we report a man in his 50s who presented at the genitourinary outpatient department with an enlarged scrotum (right side) that had developed progressively over several weeks. He also reported mild upper abdominal discomfort. Scrotal sonography revealed a hydrocele on the right side without testicular lesions. A mass pancreatic tail lesion with invasion of the spleen and left adrenal gland was identified through abdominal CT and MRI. Endoscopic ultrasound fine needle biopsy and right radical orchiectomy were performed. Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic tail with hematogenous metastasis to the right testis, epididymis and spermatic cord was verified on the basis of the pathology report. Disease progression occurred despite the patient receiving palliative chemoradiation therapy.
