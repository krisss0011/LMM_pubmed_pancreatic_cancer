Pancreatic cancer is one of the leading causes of death from cancer worldwide. The current treatment options for pancreatic cancer are unsuccessful and thereby, finding novel and more effective therapeutic strategies is urgently required. Stem cells-based therapies are currently believed to be a potential promising option in cancer therapy. Herein, we are interested in evaluating the therapeutic effects of human amniotic mesenchymal stromal cells (hAMSCs) secretome on tumor growth suppression and EMT inhibition in Panc1 pancreatic cancer cells using 2D and 3D cell culture models. For this purpose, we employed a co-culture system using 6-well Transwell plates with a pore diameter of 0.4 Î¼m. After 72 h treatment of Panc1 cancer cells with hAMSCs, the expression of c-Src, EGFR, SgK269, E-cadherin, Vimentin, Snail transcriptional factor, Bax, Bcl2, and caspase 3 was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot methods. Our results showed significant reduction in tumor cell growth and motility through downregulation of c-Src, EGFR, SgK269, E-cadherin, Vimentin, and Snail transcriptional factor expression in Panc1 pancreatic cancer cells. The induction of cellular apoptosis was also found. Our finding supports the idea that the secretome from hAMSCS has therapeutic effects on cancer cells.
