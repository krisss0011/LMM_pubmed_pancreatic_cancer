BACKGROUND Pancreatic cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world and a major cause of cancer mortality. Therefore, it is extremely important to distinguish between malignant and benign changes quickly and accurately. This single-center study aimed to assess the discriminatory properties of the color Doppler vascularity index (CDVI) in the diagnosis of focal chronic pancreatitis and malignant pancreatic tumors. MATERIAL AND METHODS Seventy-nine patients (42 men, 37 women; age 62.0Â±13.5 years; 46 adenocarcinomas; 33 pancreatitis) qualified for this study. During endosonographic examination, pancreatic tumors were assessed in the color Doppler option. The dynamic tissue perfusion measurement was used to calculate tissue flow velocity (TFV), tissue perfusion intensity (TPI), and vascularization as the CDVI. RESULTS TFV, TPI, and CDVI were significantly lower in the group with malignant tumors than in the group with pancreatitis (P<0.001). In the receiver operating characteristic analysis, results of TFV=2.181 cm/s, TPI=0.009 cm/s, and CDVI=0.268 allowed for significant prediction of malignant tumors (P<0.001), with sensitivity of 75.8%, 69.7%, and 72.7% and specificity of 91.3%, 93.5%, and 80.4%, respectively, without significant differences between perfusion parameters and CDVI (P=0.07). CONCLUSIONS The findings from this study showed that color Doppler imaging and the use of the CDVI could provide an adjunctive diagnostic approach to distinguish between pancreatic adenocarcinoma and focal chronic pancreatitis. Owing to the possibility of calculating vascularization by non-Doppler methods, the method may be an easier and more accessible diagnostic option for malignant pancreatic tumors than perfusion assessed in external software.
