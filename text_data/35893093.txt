Pancreatic cancer is becoming an increasing healthcare concern. Though it is a 14th most common cancer worldwide, its incidence is steadily rising. Results of currently available therapies are still not satisfactory. Therefore, great attention should be put on the identification and reduction of risk factors for pancreatic cancer. A thorough up-to-date review of available data on the impact of well-established and novel risk factors of pancreatic cancer development have been performed. Several risk factors associated with lifestyle have significant impact on the risk of pancreatic cancer (i.e., smoking, obesity, alcohol consumption). Physicians should also be aware of the novel findings suggesting increasing role of microbiome, including viral and bacterial infections, in the development of pancreatic cancer. A growing body of evidence suggest also an increased risk during certain occupational exposures. In general, lifestyle seems to be a major contributor in the development of pancreatic cancer. Special attention should be given to individuals with a vicious cluster consisting of metabolic syndrome, tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption. Physicians should urge patients to comply to healthy diet, cessation of smoking and moderation of alcohol consumption, which may halve pancreatic cancer incidence. Further studies are warranted to explore the potential use of therapeutic approach on novel risk factors (e.g., microbiome).
