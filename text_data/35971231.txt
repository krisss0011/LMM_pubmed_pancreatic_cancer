Introduction:Increased intrapancreatic fat deposition (IPFD) has emerged as a harbinger of pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis. Although it is well recognized that diseases of the exocrine pancreas often lie on a continuum (with acute pancreatitis preceding the development of chronic pancreatitis and/or pancreatic cancer), whether increased IPFD predisposes to acute pancreatitis is unknown. This study aimed to compare fat depositions in the pancreas (as well as the liver and skeletal muscle) between individuals who developed first attack of acute pancreatitis and healthy individuals.Methods:This was a matched case-control study nested into population-based cohort. MRI on a single 3 T scanner was used to quantify intrapancreatic, liver, and skeletal muscle fat depositions using the same protocols in all study participants. Binary logistic regression with adjustment for body mass index and other possible confounders was performed.Results:Fifty individuals with first attack of nonnecrotizing acute pancreatitis comprised the case group and 100 healthy individuals comprised the control group. A 1% increase in IPFD (but not the other fat depositions) was significantly associated with a more than 30% higher chance of developing first attack of acute pancreatitis, consistently in both the unadjusted ( P = 0.004) and all adjusted models. Furthermore, a 1% increase in IPFD (but not the other fat depositions) was significantly associated with up to a 27% higher chance of developing first attack of acute pancreatitis in individuals with normotriglyceridemia, consistently in both the unadjusted ( P = 0.030) and all adjusted models.Discussion:Increased IPFD may predispose to the development of acute pancreatitis. This opens up opportunities for reducing the burden of acute pancreatitis by means of primary prevention.
