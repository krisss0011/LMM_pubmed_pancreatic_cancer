Background:The NLRP3 inflammasome is significantly associated with tumor development and metastasis in various malignancies. However, the significance of the NLRP3 inflammasome in pancreatic adenocarcinoma has not been fully determined. Therefore, we try to evaluate the expression of the NLRP3 inflammasome in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and analyzed its prognostic significance.Methods:This cohort study enrolled 98 patients with primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma who received curative surgery. The NLRP3 inflammasome expression levels in cancer tissue were determined by immunohistochemistry, and compared with that of adjacent normal tissues. The association between NLRP3 inflammasome expression levels and baseline clinicopathological characteristics were also analyzed. Moreover, the correlation between NLRP3 inflammasome expression levels and survival was analyzed by log-rank test, and the survival curve was made by the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.Results:Expression of each NLRP3 inflammasome component in cancer tissue was higher than that in the adjacent normal tissues (allP< 0.05), including NLRP3, IL-1Î², ASC, and Caspase-1. All four components of the NLRP3 inflammasome were closely associated with clinical stage and lymph node status (allP< 0.05). The Kaplan-Meier log rank test showed that the high expression level of the NLRP3 inflammasome was significantly related to poor overall survival in pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients.Conclusions:NLRP3 inflammasome expression was upregulated in cancer tissue and closely associated with the prognosis of operable pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
