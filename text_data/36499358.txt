Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a devastating malignant tumor of gastrointestinal (GI) tumors characterized by late diagnosis, low treatment success and poor prognosis. The most common pathological type of PC is pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which accounts for approximately 95% of PC. PDAC is primarily driven by the Kirsten rat sarcoma virus (KRAS) oncogene. Ferroptosis was originally described as ras-dependent cell death but is now defined as a regulated cell death caused by iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation. Recent studies have revealed that ferroptosis plays an important role in the development and therapeutic response of tumors, especially PDAC. As the non-apoptotic cell death, ferroptosis may minimize the emergence of drug resistance for clinical trials of PDAC. This article reviews what has been learned in recent years about the mechanisms of ferroptosis in PDAC, introduces the association between ferroptosis and the KRAS target, and summarizes several potential strategies that are capable of triggering ferroptosis to suppress PDAC progression.
