Individuals at increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer, including those with a significant family history of the disease and those with pancreatic cancer susceptibility gene variants, can benefit from pancreas surveillance. Most pancreatic cancers diagnosed during surveillance are early-stage and such patients can achieve long-term survival. Determining who should undergo pancreas surveillance is still a work-in-progress, but the main tools clinicians use to estimate an individual's risk of pancreatic cancer are patient's age, the extent of their family history of pancreatic cancer, and whether or not they have a pancreatic cancer susceptibility gene mutation.
