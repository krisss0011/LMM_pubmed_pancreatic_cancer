Pancreatic cancer is a dismal malignancy with poor prognosis. In spite of progress in surgical technology, chemotherapy is still the cornerstone in the multi-disciplinary treatment. Albumin-bound paclitaxel is a first-line treatment for PDAC patients. Yet the response rate of the drug is far from satisfying. SOX8 is a member of the sex determining region Y-boxes family, which is potentially related to the chemoresistance of tumor. Patient with high expression of SOX8 were insensitive to albumin-bound paclitaxel. SOX8 reduced apoptosis and G2/M cell cycle arrest caused by albumin-bound paclitaxel. SOX8 transcriptionally regulated EZH2, which reduced expression of SPARC by promoting the methylation of SPARC, thereby reducing the transport of albumin-bound paclitaxel in pancreatic cancer cells. EZH2 inhibitor, UNC1999, can reverse the effect of SOX8 on chemo-resistance of albumin-bound paclitaxel. Collectively, our data revealed SOX8/EZH2/SPARC signaling induced primary chemo-resistance of albumin-bound paclitaxel in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
