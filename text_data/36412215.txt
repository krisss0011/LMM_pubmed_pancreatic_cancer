The occurrence and development of blood vessels play a key role in different stages of tumor growth, while current imaging techniques are difficult to detect early tumor angiogenesis because of their low sensitivity. Therefore, this article introduces high-sensitivity optical imaging technology to achieve early tumor diagnosis by detecting tumor angiogenesis. Liver and pancreatic tumor models in nude mice were respectively established to represent tumors with a rich or poor blood supply. The two optical imaging methods, in vivo confocal fluorescence imaging and photoacoustic imaging, were used to detect tumor angiogenesis at different stages. Finally, the changes in blood vessels were verified by immunostaining. Both autoluminescence imaging and pathological staining confirmed that these two tumor models were successfully established. In vivo confocal fluorescence imaging found that the early tumor blood vessel structure had obvious characteristics: disorder, tortuous deformation, thin diameter, which were significantly different from the normal tissues. Photoacoustic imaging could effectively identify blood vessels inside early tumors, which were small and disordered and might be used as one of the predictors of early tumor development. CD31 immunostaining was used to evaluate the vascular status of tumors at different stages and under different blood supply conditions. The vascular structures observed under the microscope in the two tumor models were consistent with the results observed by optical imaging methods. The optical imaging methods could monitor the characteristics of angiogenesis in the rich or poor blood supply tumors, especially the early diagnosis of tumors.
