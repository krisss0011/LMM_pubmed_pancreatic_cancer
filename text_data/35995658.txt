Background/objectives:Surveillance with endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and MRI/magnetic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is recommended for individuals at high risk for pancreatic cancer. We sought to characterize the findings of these surveillance exams and define the level of concordance between these two modalities.Methods:173 asymptomatic high-risk individuals (HRIs) meeting criteria for pancreatic cancer surveillance underwent EUS, MRI/MRCP, or both between 2008 and 2021. Clinical records were reviewed in all cases.Results:HRIs underwent an average of 3.6 ± 3.2 surveillance exams over a period of 3.3 ± 3.5 years. Abnormalities including intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), solid lesions, and parenchymal irregularities were identified in 50.9% (n = 88). Four of these abnormalities (2.3%) had worrisome features, defined by cyst size, thickened/enhancing cyst walls, rapid growth rate, or change in main pancreatic duct diameter. All four worrisome lesions were seen on both MRI/MRCP and EUS. No pancreatic cancers were detected. Baseline EUS and MRI/MRCP exams were compared in 106 patients for concordance, and most (n = 66, 62.3%) were concordant. High levels of concordance were specifically observed for a dilated main pancreatic duct (p < 0.01) and cystic lesions >5 mm (p = 0.01). Among discordant cases, most (30/40; 75%) involved abnormal tissue heterogeneity seen primarily on EUS. None of these discordant lesions ultimately developed worrisome features.Conclusions:Worrisome pancreatic lesions were uncommon in our high-risk pancreatic cancer population and were detected by both EUS and MRI/MRCP. There was mild discordance with respect to less worrisome findings, but these discrepancies were not associated with any adverse clinical outcomes.
