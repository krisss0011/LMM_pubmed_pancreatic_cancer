PARP inhibitors are largely recognized as active drugs in BRCA-mutated breast and ovarian malignancies. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, the PARP inhibitor olaparib has recently been approved as maintenance treatment in patients with germline BRCA mutations reaching disease control after a platinum-based first line chemotherapy, proving significant benefit on progression free survival. On the other hand, little evidence is available regarding olaparib as single agent after progression with standard treatment in BRCA-mutated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. A 61-year-old female patient harboring germline BRCA2 mutation was treated at our institution for a pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with lung and liver metastases. The patient received three previous lines of treatment with standard therapies, as follows: after the third line treatment failure, we started a further line of treatment with olaparib in off-label prescription. After the first two cycles, a CT scan documented partial response, with complete regression of lung metastases. The response was maintained after four cycles, with further response and clinical benefit. The radiologic and clinical response was maintained for 6 months. This case highlights the potential of olaparib as single agent after progression with standard treatment in BRCA-mutated pancreatic cancer.
