Objective:Irinotecan is a useful anticancer drug for colorectal cancer treatment. UGT1A1*28 and *6 gene polymorphisms are known risk factors for irinotecan-associated toxicity. However, severe adverse effects due to irinotecan have been observed even in patients who do not harbor UGT1A1*28 or *6. We investigated gene polymorphisms in the whole exome to identify useful biomarkers for irinotecan toxicity other than UGT1A.Methods:A total of 178 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) and 87 patients with pancreatic cancer were treated with FOLFIRI, FOLFOX, FOLFOXIRI, modified FOLFIRINOX, or gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel. Genome-wide screening was performed using whole-exome sequencing (WES), and validation analysis was performed using qPCR with a hydrolysis probe.Results:Using WES after a doublet chemotherapy regimen comprising irinotecan and 5-fluorouracil (n = 15), seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified as candidate biomarkers for irinotecan-associated toxicity of neutropenia. Among the seven SNPs, an SNP in R3H domain and coiled-coil containing 1 (R3HCC1; c.919G > A, rs2272761) showed a significant association with neutropenia (>grade 3) after doublet chemotherapy. Patients receiving irinotecan including triplet chemotherapy, FOLFOXIRI for mCRC (n = 23) or modified FOLFIRINOX for pancreatic cancer (n = 40), also showed significant linear trends between R3HCC1 polymorphism and neutropenia (p = 0.017 and 0.046, respectively). No significant association was observed in patients treated with irinotecan-free regimens, FOLFOX for mCRC (n = 66), and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel for pancreatic cancer (n = 47).Conclusion:Thus, an SNP in the R3HCC1 gene may be a useful biomarker for the toxicity of irinotecan-containing chemotherapy for mCRC and pancreatic cancer.
