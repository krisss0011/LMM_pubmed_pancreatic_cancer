Laparoscopic pancreatoduodenectomy (LPD) is a standard radical operation for pancreatic head malignant tumors by now. Due to the complex laparoscopic resection and reconstruction techniques, it is difficult to perform LPD for patients with locally advanced pancreatic head cancer after neoadjuvant therapy. Our team initiates LPD using the in-situ No-Touch isolation technique. The innovation and optimization of this modified No-Touch isolation technique emphasize exploring the distal section of superior mesenteric vein (SMV) and the left side of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) prior to evaluating the resectability by subcolonic mesenteric approach, which is an ideal exploring approach. After that, we use the median-anterior, and left-posterior of SMA approaches to cut off the blood flow of the pancreatic head to make the tumor isolated intact, then move and dissect the tumor. It is a process fitting the surgical principle of tumor-free. This article aims to demonstrate the feasibility and safety of performing LPD using the in-situ No-Touch isolation technique, which might elevate the R0 resection rate. It is an oncological ideal operation process.
