Cancer pain is a significant issue in terminally ill cancer patients (TICPs). The fentanyl patch (FP) is used extensively for treating cancer pain, but FP requirements vary between patients. We aimed to identify determinants of FP requirements in TICPs and propose effective pain relief using a FP. In a retrospective chart review, we investigated cancer patients admitted to our hospital from April 2012 to July 2015 and used FP until death. The time course of FP use in TICPs until death was examined. The primary endpoint was the final dose of FP use (FDFP). In total, 79 patients were included the analysis. FDFP was inversely correlated with age (R= -0.262,p= 0.20; Spearman test). FDFP tended to be higher in males than in females and was significantly higher in patients with pancreatic cancer than in patients without pancreatic cancer (p= 0.017; Welch's test). FP adjustments were more frequent in the last 60 days of life in patients with pancreatic cancer than in patients with other malignancies (P for interaction = 0.002; mixed effect model). In conclusion, younger age, and pancreatic cancer were associated with higher FP requirements in TICPs. TICPs with pancreatic cancer required more frequent FP adjustment near death.
