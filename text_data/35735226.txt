Objective:To evaluate the impact of multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings on the management of patients with neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs).Methods:All newly referred gastro-entero-pancreatic (GEP)-NEN patients discussed from 1 April to 1 October 2017 in the MDT of seven European expert centres were prospectively included. The impact on patients' management was defined as a change in diagnosis, grade, stage or treatment.Results:A total of 292 patients were included, mainly small intestinal (siNENs) (32%) and pancreatic NENs (28%), with distant metastases in 51%. Patients had received prior surgery in 43% of cases and prior medical treatment in 32%. A significant change occurred in 61% of NENs: 7% changes in diagnosis, 8% in grade and 16% in stage. The MDT recommended a new treatment for 51% of patients, mainly surgery (9%) or somatostatin analogues (20%). A significant change was most frequently observed in patients with Stage IV disease (hazard ratio [HR] 3.6, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.9-6.9 vs. Stage I) and G2 NENs (vs. G1, HR 2.1 95% CI: 1.2-3.8).Conclusion:NEN-dedicated MDT discussion in expert centres yields significant management changes in over 60% of patients and thus represents the gold standard for the management of these patients.
