We present the update of the recommendations of the French society of oncological radiotherapy on radiotherapy of pancreatic tumors. Currently, the use of radiation therapy for patients with pancreatic cancer is subject to discussion. In the adjuvant setting, the standard treatment is six months of chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracile, irinotecan and oxaliplatin. Chemoradiation may improve the survival of patients with incompletely resected tumours (R1). This remains to be confirmed by a prospective trial. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation is a promising treatment especially for patients with borderline resectable tumours. For patients with locally advanced tumours, there is no standard. An induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation for non progressive patients reduces the rate of local relapse. Whereas in the first trials of chemoradiation large fields were used, the treated volumes have been reduced to improve tolerance. Tumour movements induced by breathing should be taken in account. Intensity modulated radiation therapy allows a reduction of doses to the organs at risk. Whereas widely used, this technique has poor evidence-based recommendation. Stereotactic body radiation therapy is also being studied, as a neoadjuvant or exclusive treatment.
