Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatment improves the prognosis of several types of solid tumors, however, responsiveness to ICB therapy remains low in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDACs), which has a rich tumor microenvironment (TME). The TME is composed of various stromal cells, including cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which contribute to the establishment of an immunosuppressive microenvironment. The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway is an innate immune pathway that results in the upregulation of immune cell recruiting-cytokines and anti-tumor efficacy. In this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of cGAS-STING expression and the presence of CAFs upon immune cell infiltration in PDACs. cGAS and STING co-expressing PDAC cases showed favorable survival, with many cytotoxic CD8 + T cell infiltrations from the stromal component adjacent to the cancer cells toward cancer cells, but not in cGAS-STING signaling defected PDAC cases. The signatures of tumor-restrain CAFs were expressed in tumors with cGAS-STING signaling. Finally, transwell co-culture experiments demonstrated that immune cell infiltration was impeded by the presence of CAFs, but not by activation of cGAS-STING signaling. In conclusion, pro-infiltration signals, such as cGAS-STING, and characterization of CAFs are crucial in defeating CAF barricades and encouraging immune cell infiltration in PDACs.
