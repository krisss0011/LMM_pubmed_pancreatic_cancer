Objectives:The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine (GnP) compared with gemcitabine monotherapy (G) for patients with unresectable metastatic pancreatic cancer in Japan from the perspective of healthcare payer.Methods:A partitioned survival analysis model was developed to predict costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for GnP and G. The time horizon of the model was set at 20 years. An annual discount rate of 2% for both costs and QALYs was applied. Data on overall survival and progression-free survival were derived from the Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Clinical Trial. Cost parameters were estimated from a Japanese medical claims database. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of GnP compared with G was estimated. One-way sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the uncertainty in the parameter settings. In addition, scenario and probability sensitivity analyses were performed.Results:The incremental cost and QALY of GnP compared with G were US$25 089 and 0.13 QALY, respectively. The ICER of GnP was estimated to be US$192 992 per QALY gained. Although the ICER was influenced by utility parameters and the survival curves, the ICERs remained higher than the willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of US$68 000 (JPY 7.5 million). The probability that GnP becomes cost-effective compared with G was estimated to be 29.2%.Conclusions:Applying the WTP threshold of US$68 000 per QALY, GnP was not cost-effective for patients with unresectable metastatic pancreatic cancer in Japan from the perspective of healthcare payer. Further research is needed to obtain utility data from Japanese patients with pancreatic cancer.
