Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a devastating disease, offering poor mortality rates for patients. The current challenge being faced is the inability to diagnose patients in a timely manner, where potentially curative resection provides the best chance of survival. Recently, small/nanosized extracellular vesicles (sEVs), including exosomes, have gained significant preclinical and clinical attention due to their emerging roles in cancer progression and diagnosis. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) possess endogenous properties that offer stability and facilitate crossing of biological barriers for delivery of molecular cargo to cells, acting as a form of intercellular communication to regulate function and phenotype of recipient cells. This review provides an overview of the role of EVs, their subtypes and their oncogenic cargo (as characterised by targeted studies as well as agnostic '-omics' analyses) in the pathobiology of pancreatic cancer. The discussion covers the progress of 'omics technology' that has enabled elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that mediate the role of EVs and their cargo in pancreatic cancer progression.
