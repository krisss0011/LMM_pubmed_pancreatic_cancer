Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly malignant cancer of the digestive system common among humans. However, it is rarely reported in wild animals. In 2018, a giant panda died in the Beijing Zoo. During subsequent histological observation of the pancreas, it was discovered that the glandular epithelial cells had lost the pancreatic acinar structure, tubular areas with obvious structure in the pancreas, and the ductal epithelium was substituted by high columnar mucus cells. Masson staining showed that there were several fibrous tissue proliferative reactions around the ductal adenocarcinoma and immunohistochemical staining revealed that CK7 and CK19 were positively expressed in the pancreatic tissue. Therefore, the pathological diagnosis indicated that the panda had PDAC. In this paper, the panda's living conditions and pathological diagnosis results are examined, with the aim of providing a reference point for the future diagnosis of wild animal tumors.
