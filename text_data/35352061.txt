Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive cancer that is most frequently detected at advanced stages, limiting treatment options to systemic chemotherapy with modest clinical responses. Here, we review recent advances in targeted therapy and immunotherapy for treating subtypes of PDAC with diverse molecular alterations. We focus on the current preclinical and clinical evidence supporting the potential of these approaches and the promise of combinatorial regimens to improve the lives of patients with PDAC.
