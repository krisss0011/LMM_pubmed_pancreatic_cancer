Background:Expanding indications for neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for resectable pancreatic cancer prolong the period from diagnosis to surgery. In resectable pancreatic cancer with malignant biliary obstruction (MBO), the biliary drainage method without any biliary events is ideally required to safely perform NAC as planned. Plastic stents (PS) have been traditionally used for preoperative biliary drainage; however, recently, covered self-expandable metallic stents (CSEMS) have emerged as a tool for preoperative biliary drainage.Aims:To compare CSEMS with PS for preoperative biliary drainage in the management of resectable pancreatic cancer with MBO.Methods:In this multicenter retrospective cohort study, we compared CSEMS with PS for preoperative biliary drainage in patients with pancreatic cancer at three tertiary care centers between 2008 and 2019.Results:Of the 120 enrolled patients, 45 underwent CSEMS and 75 underwent PS. No significant difference was observed in the basic characteristics between the groups. The rate of recurrent biliary obstruction (RBO) was significantly lower and the time to RBO was significantly longer in the CSEMS group. In multivariate analysis, CSEMS was an independent factor for a longer RBO. However, pancreatitis and cholecystitis were more common in the CSEMS group. The surgery-related adverse events were not significantly different between the two groups, except for longer surgery time and time to discharge in the CSEMS group.Conclusions:CSEMS for preoperative endoscopic biliary drainage in patients with pancreatic cancer reduced RBO, although the risk for pancreatitis or cholecystitis could be increased.
