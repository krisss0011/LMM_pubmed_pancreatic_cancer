Purpose:In patients with metastatic functional gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NENs), it is unknown what degree of tumor reduction is required to eliminate hormonal symptoms. We aimed to reduce hormonal symptoms derived from advanced GEP-NENs by efficient minimal intervention, constructing a hormonal tumor map of liver metastases.Methods:Between 2013 and 2019, we treated 12 insulinoma or gastrinoma patients with liver metastases. Liver segments containing hormone-producing tumors were identified by injecting calcium gluconate via the hepatic arteries and monitoring the change in serum hormone concentration in the three hepatic veins. A greater-than-twofold increase in hormone concentration indicated a tumor-feeding vessel.Results:Cases included eight insulinomas and four gastrinomas. Primary lesions were functional in three patients and nonfunctional in 9. Nine patients showed hormonal step-up indicating the presence of functional lesions; eight showed step-up in tumor-bearing liver segments, while one with synchronous liver metastases showed step-up only in the pancreatic region. Five patients underwent surgery. Serum hormone concentration decreased markedly after removing the culprit lesions in 3; immediate improvement in hormonal symptoms was achieved in all patients. Three patients with previous surgical treatment who showed step-up underwent transcatheter arterial embolization, achieving temporary improvement of hormonal symptoms. Four patients showed unclear localization of the hormone-producing tumors; treatment options were limited, resulting in poor outcomes.Conclusion:Hormonal tumor mapping demonstrated heterogeneity in hormone production among primary and metastatic tumors of GEP-NENs. Minimally invasive treatment based on hormonal mapping may be a viable alternative to conventional cytoreduction.
