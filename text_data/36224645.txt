Pancreatic cancer is characterized by inter-tumoral and intra-tumoral heterogeneity, especially in genetic alteration and microenvironment. Conventional therapeutic strategies for pancreatic cancer usually suffer resistance, highlighting the necessity for personalized precise treatment. Cancer vaccines have become promising alternatives for pancreatic cancer treatment because of their multifaceted advantages including multiple targeting, minimal nonspecific effects, broad therapeutic window, low toxicity, and induction of persistent immunological memory. Multiple conventional vaccines based on the cells, microorganisms, exosomes, proteins, peptides, or DNA against pancreatic cancer have been developed; however, their overall efficacy remains unsatisfactory. Compared with these vaccine modalities, messager RNA (mRNA)-based vaccines offer technical and conceptional advances in personalized precise treatment, and thus represent a potentially cutting-edge option in novel therapeutic approaches for pancreatic cancer. This review summarizes the current progress on pancreatic cancer vaccines, highlights the superiority of mRNA vaccines over other conventional vaccines, and proposes the viable tactic for designing and applying personalized mRNA vaccines for the precise treatment of pancreatic cancer.
