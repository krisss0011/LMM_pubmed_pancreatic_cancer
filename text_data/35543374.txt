Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) significantly improves the diagnostic yield of fine needle aspiration (FNA) samples but critically depends on the skills and availability of cytopathologists. Here, we introduce a portable device for semi-automated sample preparation for ROSE. In a single platform, the device combines a smearing tool and a capillary-driven chamber for staining FNA samples. Using a human pancreatic cancer cell line (PANC-1) and liver, lymph node, and thyroid FNA model samples, we demonstrate the capability of the device to prepare samples for ROSE. By minimizing the equipment needed in the operating room, the device may simplify the performance of FNA sample preparation and lead to a wider implementation of ROSE.
