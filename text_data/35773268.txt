Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is categorized as the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. However, its predictive markers for long-term survival are not well known. It is interesting to delineate individual-specific perturbed genes when comparing long-term (LT) and short-term (ST) PDAC survivors and integrate individual- and group-based transcriptome profiling. Using a discovery cohort of 19 PDAC patients from CHU-Li√®ge (Belgium), we first performed differential gene expression analysis comparing LT to ST survivor. Second, we adopted systems biology approaches to obtain clinically relevant gene modules. Third, we created individual-specific perturbation profiles. Furthermore, we used Degree-Aware disease gene prioritizing (DADA) method to develop PDAC disease modules; Network-based Integration of Multi-omics Data (NetICS) to integrate group-based and individual-specific perturbed genes in relation to PDAC LT survival. We identified 173 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in ST and LT survivors and five modules (including 38 DEGs) showing associations to clinical traits. Validation of DEGs in the molecular lab suggested a role of REG4 and TSPAN8 in PDAC survival. Via NetICS and DADA, we identified various known oncogenes such as CUL1 and TGFB1. Our proposed analytic workflow shows the advantages of combining clinical and omics data as well as individual- and group-level transcriptome profiling.
