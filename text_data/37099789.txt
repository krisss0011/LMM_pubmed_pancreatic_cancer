Objectives:Significance of long noncoding RNAs in pancreatic cancer (PC) progression has been documented. Here, we identified a novel long noncoding RNA MIR600HG in PC and its underlying mechanism during PC progression.Methods:Through bioinformatics analysis, we selected MIR600HG, microRNA-125a-5p (miR-125a-5p), and mitochondrial tumor suppressor 1 (MTUS1) as objects with their expression patterns assayed in the collected PC tissues and PC cells. Pancreatic cancer cells were manipulated with ectopic expression and deficiency of MIR600HG, miR-125a-5p, and/or MTUS1 for assaying cell biological processes in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo.Results:MIR600HG and MTUS1 levels were downregulated and miR-125a-5p was upregulated in PC tissues and cells. MIR600HG could bind to miR-125a-5p, while miR-125a-5p negatively targeted MTUS1. MIR600HG resulted in suppression in malignant properties of PCs. All these changes could be reversed by miR-125a-5p elevation. In addition, miR-125a-5p targeted MTUS1 to activate the extracellular regulated protein kinases signaling pathway. In vivo experiment also verified the inhibitory role of MIR600HG in PC.Conclusions:Taken together, MIR600HG acts as an inhibitor for PC progression by upregulating miR-125a-5p-mediated MTUS1 through extracellular regulated protein kinases pathway.
