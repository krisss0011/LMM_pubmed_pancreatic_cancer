Background:Immunotherapy is a novel hotspot for the treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD). However, potential biomarkers which could identify the inflamed tumor microenvironment (TME) are urgently required.Methods:In the present study, we measured the levels of B7-H3, B7-H4, and major tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) using bioinformatics analyses and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining on PAAD samples represented in the tissue microarray (TMA) format. Statistical analysis and figures exhibition were performed using R 4.1.0, SPSS 26.0, and GraphPad Prism 6.0.Results:B7-H3 and B7-H4 were up-regulated in PAAD compared with para-tumor tissues, and their expression exhibited no tight correlation in PAAD tissues. B7-H3 and B7-H4 were lowly expressed in well-differentiated PAAD tissues and correlated with poorly differentiated grades. Besides, single B7-H3 or B7-H4 expression exhibited limited prognostic value, but co-deficiency of B7-H3 and B7-H4 predicted a better prognosis in PAAD. Moreover, co-deficiency of B7-H3 and B7-H4 indicated immuno-hot tumors with high CD8 + T cell infiltration.Conclusions:Overall, combined B7-H3 and B7-H4 expression is a promising stratification strategy to assess prognosis and immunogenicity in PAAD, which could be used as a novel classifier in clinical practice.
