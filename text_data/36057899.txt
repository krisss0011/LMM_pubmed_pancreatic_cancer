Background:Pancreatic cancer is a recalcitrant disease in which R0 resection is often not achieved owing to difficulty in visualization of the tumor margins and proximity of adjacent vessels. To improve outcomes, we have developed fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) and photoimmunotherapy (PIT) using a fluorescent tumor-specific antibody.Methods:Nude mice received surgical orthotopic implantation (SOI) of the human pancreatic cancer cell line BxPC-3 expressing green fluorescent protein. An anti-carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) monoclonal antibody (6G5j) was conjugated to the 700-nm fluorescent dye IR700DyeDX (6G5j-IR700DX). Three weeks after SOI, 16 mice received 50 μg 6G5j-IR700DX via the tail vein 24 h before surgery and were randomized to two groups: FGS-only (n = 8) and FGS + PIT (n = 8). All tumors were imaged with the Pearl Trilogy imaging system and resected under the guidance of the FLARE imaging system. The FGS + PIT group received PIT of the post-surgical bed at an intensity of 150 mW/cm2for 30 min. Mice were sacrificed 4 weeks after initial surgery, and tumors were imaged with a Dino-Lite digital microscope, excised, and weighed.Results:The 6G5j-IR700DX dye illuminated the orthotopic pancreatic tumors for FGS and PIT. The metastatic recurrence rate was 100.0% for FGS-only and 25.0% for FGS + PIT (p = 0.007). The average total recurrent tumor weight was 2370.3 ± 1907.8 mg for FGS-only and 705.5 ± 1200.0 mg for FGS + PIT (p = 0.039).Conclusions:FGS and adjuvant PIT can be combined by using a single antibody-fluorophore conjugate to significantly reduce the frequency of pancreatic cancer recurrence.
