Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the third-leading cause of cancer-related death. Owing to its poor prognosis, new molecular biomarkers for PDAC are needed. Annexin A10 (ANXA10) is a calcium-/phospholipid-binding protein belonging to the annexin family of proteins. ANXA10 is not only associated with gastric phenotypes, but also acts an independent prognostic factor in several cancers. However, the role of ANXA10 in PDAC remains unknown. Therefore, we examined the relationship between ANXA10 and the prognosis of PDAC. We analyzed the expression of ANXA10 using data from public databases, and performed immunohistochemistry analysis for 81 PDAC cases. We then investigated the relationship between ANXA10 expression and clinicopathological features. ANXA10 was detected in 47 of 81 PDAC cases (58%). High expression of ANXA10 was significantly related to poor overall survival (OS; p=0.011). Univariate analysis of OS revealed three prognostic parameters: tumor grade (p=0.046), perineural invasion (p=0.017), and ANXA10 expression (p=0.012). Multivariate analysis indicated that ANXA10 expression (p<0.01) alone was a prognostic factor in PDAC cases. Our findings suggest that ANXA10 expression is an independent prognostic factor in PDAC cases and shows promise as a new biomarker in PDAC.
