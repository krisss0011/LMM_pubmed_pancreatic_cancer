Pancreatic cancer is one of the most challenging cancer types in clinical treatment worldwide. This study aimed to understand the tumorigenesis mechanism and explore potential therapeutic targets for patients with pancreatic cancer. Single-cell data and expression profiles of pancreatic cancer samples and normal tissues from multiple databases were included. Comprehensive bioinformatics analyses were applied to clarify tumor microenvironment and identify key genes involved in cancer development. Immense difference of cell types was shown between tumor and normal samples. Four cell types (B cell_1, B cell_2, cancer cell_3, and CD1C+_B dendritic cell_3) were screened to be significantly associated with prognosis. Three ligand-receptor pairs, including CD74-MIF, CD74-COPA, and CD74-APP, greatly contributed to tumorigenesis. High expression of BUB1 (BUB1 Mitotic Checkpoint Serine/Threonine Kinase) was closely correlated with worse prognosis. CD1C+_B dendritic cell_3 played a key role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression possibly through CD74-MIF. BUB1 can serve as a prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target for patients with pancreatic cancer. The study provided a novel insight into studying the molecular mechanism of pancreatic cancer development and proposed a potential strategy for exploiting new drugs.
