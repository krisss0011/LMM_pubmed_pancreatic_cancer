Background & aims:The Notch signaling pathway is an important pathway in the adult pancreas and in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), with hairy and enhancer of split-1 (HES1) as the core molecule in this pathway. However, the roles of HES1 in the adult pancreas and PDAC formation remain controversial.Methods:We used genetically engineered dual-recombinase mouse models for inducing Hes1 deletion under various conditions.Results:The loss of Hes1 expression in the adult pancreas did not induce phenotypic alterations. However, regeneration was impaired after caerulein-induced acute pancreatitis. In a pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) mouse model, PanINs rarely formed when Hes1 deletion preceded PanIN formation, whereas more PanINs were formed when Hes1 deletion succeeded PanIN formation. In a PDAC mouse model, PDAC formation was also enhanced by Hes1 deletion after PanIN/PDAC development; therefore, Hes1 promotes PanIN initiation but inhibits PanIN/PDAC progression. RNA sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that Hes1 deletion enhanced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition via Muc5ac up-regulation in PDAC progression. The results indicated that HES1 is not required for maintaining the adult pancreas under normal conditions, but is important for regeneration during recovery from pancreatitis; moreover, Hes1 plays different roles, depending on the tumor condition.Conclusions:Our findings highlight the context-dependent roles of HES1 in the adult pancreas and pancreatic cancer.
