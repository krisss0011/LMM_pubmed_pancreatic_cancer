BACKGROUND: Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPNs) of the pancreas are indolent 
rare tumors with malignant potential. The risk factors associated with the 
malignant behavior of SPNs are still unclear.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients with SPNs who underwent surgical 
treatment in the First Hospital of Jilin University from January 2010 to January 
2022 was conducted. The clinical baseline data, pathology, imaging, and 
laboratory indicators of the patients were analyzed by univariate and 
multivariate logistic regression to identify the independent risk factors 
associated with the high-risk groups, and a predictive model was established in 
the form of a nomogram.
RESULTS: In multivariate analysis, clinical symptoms (P < 0.001), unclear tumor 
margins (P = 0.001), incomplete tumor capsules (P = 0.005), maximum tumor 
diameters ≥ 7.2 cm (P = 0.003), and prognostic nutritional index values < 47.45 
(P = 0.007) were independent risk factor for SPNs with high-risk groups. A 
nomogram model was successfully established to predict high-risk groups of SPNs. 
The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.856. The 
calibration prediction curve was in good agreement with the standard curve.
CONCLUSION: The nomogram model based on clinical symptoms, inflammatory markers, 
and imaging features had a high application value in the preoperative prediction 
of the high-risk groups of SPNs. A novel nomogram of the affiliated hospital of 
Jilin University-SPNs risk model was proposed for routine application to guide 
the patient counseling in clinical practice.
