Minimally invasive spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy (SPDP) is technically challenging, and only a few reports have described surgical approaches for minimally invasive SPDP. This report demonstrates our novel gastrohepatic ligament approach in robotic SPDP with preservation of the splenic vessels (the superior window approach in the Kimura technique). Our gastrohepatic ligament approach for robotic SPDP included four steps. First, the gastrohepatic ligament was divided extensively, and the pancreas was confirmed (step 1). In this step, we did not lift the stomach, nor did we divide the gastrocolic ligament. Next, the superior and inferior borders of the pancreas were dissected, and the tunneling of the pancreas on the superior mesenteric vein was performed (step 2). Following the division of the pancreas (step 3), the pancreatic body and tail were dissected from the medial to the lateral side with preservation of the splenic vessels (step 4). Using this approach, the pancreas can be directly accessed via the gastrohepatic ligament route and dissected without division of the gastrocolic ligament or retraction of the stomach. The present approach for robotic SPDP preserves splenic vessels, facilitating easy access to the pancreas with minimal dissection, and may be optional in selected patients, including those with low body mass index.
