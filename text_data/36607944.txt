Objectives:Epidemiological studies have reported the association of poor oral hygiene, especially periodontal disease, and tooth loss with the risk of pancreatic cancer (PC). However, these studies have yielded inconsistent results. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the relationship between oral disease and PC.Methods:We systematically searched the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases for English literature since inception through May 2021. We used relative risks, hazard ratios, or odds ratios to measure the association between oral disease and PC. A fixed- or random-effects model was applied to evaluate pooled risk estimates, and sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed to identify sources of heterogeneity and pooled estimation.Results:We identified 17 relevant observational studies involving 1,352,256 participants. Notably, oral disease correlated significantly with PC (hazard ratio [HR], 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-1.54). In subgroup analyses, subjects with periodontal disease (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.12-1.71) had a higher risk of developing PC than those with tooth loss (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.97-1.46).Conclusions:The results suggest that subjects with oral disease may face a significant and independent risk of PC. However, the mechanisms linking oral disease and PC are uncertain, and additional investigations of this correlation are warranted.
