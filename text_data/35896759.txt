Background:We evaluated the effect of an Enhanced Recovery After Surgery protocol on intraoperative fluid administration and postoperative outcomes in pancreatic surgery.Methods:Pancreatic cancer resections at our institution from 2012 to 2018 were grouped according to pre- or post-protocol initiation. Preoperative characteristics and postoperative outcomes were compared with Fisher's exact test and chi-square for categorical variables, and Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables. Further analysis separated patients that had a Whipple from those who had distal pancreatectomy.Results:A total of 263 patients underwent pancreatic cancer resection during the study period (169 Whipples, 84 DPs, 92 pre-ERAS and 171 post-ERAS). Intraoperative fluid administration significantly decreased after protocol implementation (mean 6,277 ml vs. 3870 ml, p &lt; 0.001). This held true when separating patients that had a Whipple procedure from those that had a DP (6,929 ml vs. 4,513 ml, p &lt; 0.001, 5,060 ml vs. 2,833 cc, p = 0.002, respectively). Intensive care unit (ICU) admission (41.3% vs. 20.5%, p &lt; 0.001) and length of stay (9.4 vs. 8.1 days, p &lt; 0.01) were significantly reduced after ERAS implementation for all patients and in Whipple patients alone (47.5% vs. 23.6%, p = 0.002 and 10.7 vs. 6.6 days, p = 0.004). DP patients also had significantly decreased ICU admissions (41.3% vs. 20.5%, p = 0.045). All other postoperative outcomes were not significantly different.Conclusion:For patients undergoing pancreatic cancer resection, goal-directed fluid management is associated with decreased intraoperative fluid administration, decreased ICU admission, and decreased length of stay without an increase in postoperative complications or readmission.
