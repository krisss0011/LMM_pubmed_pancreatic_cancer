Background/aim:Adoptive immunotherapy (AIT) using autologous zoledronate-activated killer (ZAK) cells has been performed for developing a novel modality of cancer treatment. In this study, data series from incurable pancreatic cancer were analyzed.Patients and methods:Patients were treated with AIT using intravenous administration of ZAK cells every 3 to 4 weeks in combination with standard chemotherapy and possible clinical benefits were examined.Results:Seventy-five patients were treated. A median overall survival (OS) time of 6.7 months was achieved for all patients and 13.1 months for those treated 5 times or more, that increased to 14.6 and 18.3 months, respectively, when the previous treatment period of chemotherapy alone was included in the analysis. The disease control rate was 58.5 %. Multivariate regression analysis showed a significant positive correlation between the survival and baseline value of lymphocyte percentage in white blood cell counts (p=0.031).Conclusion:The data suggest that AIT using ZAK cells in combination with chemotherapy is safe and feasible and may be effective in prolonging survival for patients with incurable pancreatic cancer. The lymphocyte percentage at baseline may be a good biomarker for predicting the survival benefit of ZAK cell AIT.
