Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) represent a clinically challenging disease because these tumors vary in clinical presentation, natural history, and prognosis. Novel prognostic biomarkers are needed to improve patient stratification and treatment options. Several putative prognostic and/or predictive biomarkers (eg, alternative lengthening of telomeres, alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation, X-linked (ATRX)/Death Domain Associated Protein (DAXX) loss) have been independently validated. Additionally, recent transcriptomic and epigenetic studies focusing on endocrine differentiation have identified PanNET subtypes that display similarities to either α-cells or β-cells and differ in clinical outcomes. Thus, future prospective studies that incorporate genomic and epigenetic biomarkers are warranted and have translational potential for individualized therapeutic and surveillance strategies.
