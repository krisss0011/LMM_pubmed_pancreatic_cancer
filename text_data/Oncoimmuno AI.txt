Natural Killer (NK) cells, a subset of innate immune cells, undergo cancer-
speci ﬁc changes during tumor progression. Therefore, tracking NK cell activity
in circulation has potential for cancer diagnosis. Identi ﬁc a t i o no ft u m o r
associated NK cells remains a challen ge as most of the cancer antigens are
unknown. Here, we introduce tumor-associated circulating NK cell pro ﬁling
(CNKP) as a stand-alone cancer diagnos tic modality with a liquid biopsy.
Metabolic pro ﬁles of NK cell activation as a result of tumor interaction are
detected with a SERS functionalized OncoImmune probe platform. We showthat the cancer stem cell-associated NK cell is of value in cancer diagnosis.
Through machine learning, the feature s of NK cell activity in patient blood
could identify cancer from non-cance ru s i n g5 u Lo fp e r i p h e r a lb l o o dw i t h

show the feasibility of minimally invasiv e cancer diagnostics using circulating
NK cells.
Natural killer cells (NK cells), a subpopulation of lymphocytes
demonstrate spontaneous cytotoxicity towards tumors andviruses
1. NK cells are part of the innate immune system with an
essential function as the ﬁrst line of defense against cancer
development2,3. Moreover, NK cells do not require previous sen-
sitization to recognize tumors4. As NK cells can discriminate
between cancerous cells from other healthy cells, the diagnostic
value of NK cell activity is signi ﬁcant. The ﬁeld of immunotherapy
has gained momentum in the last few years5–7, but the possibility of
cancer diagnosis with NK cells has been overlooked. In adults, NKcells account for 5% to 20% of total lymphocytes in circulation

a result, NK cells will provide a realistic opportunity for cancerdiagnosis. We hypothesize that the presence of tumor will re ﬂect
in the metabolic pro ﬁle of NK cells as a result of NK cell activation
during tumor interaction. The signals derived from such anactivated state and quiescent NK cell state in circulation will enable
accurate cancer diagnosis.
Cancer heterogeneity, a hallmark of cancer and cancer stem cells
(CSCs) have a critical activity in tumor initiation, sustained prolifera-tion and maintenance of tumor and help in metastasis. Cancer diag-nosis research has established the importance of CSCs, a highly
tumorigenic subset of tumor cells demonstrating migration and
apoptosis resistance
9. These fundamental building blocks of carcino-
genesis and cancer evolution are positively correlated to therapeuticfailures, drug resistance, and tumor relapse
10–12. NK cells show pre-
ferential cytotoxicity towards CSCs as compared to the differentiatedcounterparts
13–15. The susceptibility of CSCs towards NK cells is
attributed to the upregulation of cytotoxicity receptors on NK cellsand their respective ligands of CSCs. Moreover, CSCs enriched afterantiproliferative therapies show increased expression of stress ligandsReceived: 18 August 2021

CSC-associated NK cells may prove to be an effective cancer diagnosticapproach.
For detection of the rare signals of tumor-associated NK cells in
circulation, an ultrasensitive sensor is necessary. It is very dif ﬁcult to
identify tumor-associated NK cells as most cancer antigens areunknown. Currently, there is no diagnostic tool to detect tumor-associated NK cells in circulation. Therefore, a marker-free approachwas necessary. Furthermore, the use of blood samples without cellularisolation was essential to preserve the integrity of the rare signals of NKcell interaction with tumor
17. The ultrasensitive technique of Surface-
enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) was adopted as the detectionmethodology. SERS has demonstrated the capability of marker-freediagnosis
18. SERS interconnects biomolecular chemistry and physics to
biomolecular functions. Exploration of the complex NK Cell functional
signatures can be achieved intuitively with SERS19. However, SERS
nanostructures are well known for signi ﬁcant challenges in achieving
reproducible and uniform Raman response. One-dimensional and two-dimensional distribution of hot spots suffers from limited densityresulting in inhomogeneous signal distribution and non-reproduciblesignals. Uniform SERS active sites are extremely dif ﬁcult, expensive,
and time-consuming to produce. To overcome this limitation, wedeveloped a nickel-based metal-semiconductor probe system for thegeneration of stable and reproducible signals. Nickel is an inexpensivecatalyst with numerous critical features, including oxidative additionand easy access to different oxidation states, which are signi ﬁcant in
the development of metal-semiconductor nano systems
20–22.T h e s e
fundamental properties of nickel enable a wide range of applicationsincluding SERS. The plasmonic enhancement of nickel is widelyreported
23–29in addition to the charge transfer-based enhancement.
Consequently, the introduction of a hybrid material composed ofnickel and nickel oxide results in not only a signi ﬁcantly improved
SERS signal but also a signal that can be reproduced, which is extre-mely valuable for cellular diagnostic applications with semiconductor-based nanosensor technologies. Such materials (metal-semi-conductor) will also make it possible for more substances to be can-didates for Raman sensing. Synthesis of large quantities of
nanomaterial is equally challenging. Here we have demonstrated the
use of femtosecond laser fabrication methodology, which is amend-able for mass production useful in large-scale research on cellularstructures and intracellular signals. Additionally, for the sensor tobe robust, highly reproducible signals are required. The use of themultiphoton ionization mechanism of ultrashort femtosecondpulsed laser results in uniform production of multi-mode probesthat are highly reproducible. The modern ﬁber-oscillator/ ﬁber-
ampli ﬁer design of this laser provides high spatial mode quality with
very low noise performance. The ﬁber ampli ﬁer of this laser minimizes
variation of energy levels. This results in very stable peak power and
ionization energy performance resulting in the synthesis of nano-
particles with minimal distribution and dimension variation.“OncoImmune probe platform ”was synthesized with 3D networks of
nickel nanoprobes. The shape of the probes was tuned for ultra-sensitive detection.
In this work, we explore the feasibility of using the signals derived
from cancer-cell-associated NK cells as well as CSC-associated NK cellsas a stand-alone cancer diagnosis methodology. OncoImmune probeplatform functionalized with SERS capability is introduced for under-taking circulating NK cell pro ﬁling (CNKP) for cancer diagnosis. This is
achieved by atomic scale narrowing of the probe apices resulting in asubstantial increase in the localized surface plasmon resonance (~650-
fold enhancement with a limit of detection of up to femtomolar
(10
−15M) concentration). This marker-free approach enables the gen-
eration of the holistic pro ﬁles of the metabolic states of NK cells.
SERS pro ﬁling of NK cells associated with hard-to-detect cancers
(triple negative breast cancer, small cell lung cancer, colorectaladenocarcinoma cancer encompassing about 60% of cancer cases) is
achieved with single-cell sensitivity with highly reproducible signals.CNKP of cancer-cell-associated NK cells and CSC-associated NK cellsdemonstrates well-de ﬁned, distinct, cancer-speci ﬁcs i g n a l s .W e
experimentally show the preferential targeting of CSCs by NK cells
compared to cancer cells with a 1.4-fold increase ( p< 0.0001 ttest) in
activation for CSC-associated NK cells. This also demonstrates that theuse of CNKP of CSC-associated NK cells is useful for cancer diagnosis.The machine learning model trained with SERS signals of NK cellactivity in cell culture can identify cancer from non-cancer with a verysmall amount of peripheral blood (5 µL) without the need for cellular
isolation with 100% prediction accuracy. Localization of tumor shows aprediction accuracy of up to 93%. As the training data is obtained fromeasy to collect cell-culture, this approach eliminates the disadvantagesof insuf ﬁcient human data for training. By utilizing tumor-associated
NK cell signals in peripheral blood, CNKP has the potential to improve
minimally invasive cancer diagnostics.
Results and discussion
Prediction of tumor-associated NK cells for cancer diagnosis
method
In this study, we report that molecular probing of NK cells has the
potential to provide diagnostic information for cancer patients. AsCSCs are resistant to antiproliferative therapies and have the ability torepopulate bulk tumor
30, it is important to identify CSCs. In this study,
the existence of CSCs was determined by observing changes in NK cell
expressions. To detect the presence of CSCs, NK cells were selected for
several reasons. NK cells forming the critical part of the innate immunesystem, are the ﬁrst line of defense against cancer and are responsible
for the cancer immune surveillance
3. Additionally, NK cells do not
require any prior sensitization to recognize tumors4.M o r e o v e r ,
amongst all immune cells, only NK cells demonstrate preferentialcytotoxicity towards CSCs
16,31,32. Although CSCs are able to escape
other immune cells, CSCs cannot escape NK cell surveillance anddemonstrate vulnerability towards NK cells. Therefore, we hypothesizethat the presence of CSCs will naturally activate NK cells with signaturemolecular changes, enabling identi ﬁcation of CSCs and hence the
presence of cancer. Figure 1illustrates this diagnostic approach. For
this purpose, NK cells were cocultured with cancer cells as well asCSCs. This led to NK cells exhibiting three phenotypes based on cell-speci ﬁc association. Consistent with this idea, we obtained naïve NK
cell spectra, cancer-associated NK cell spectra, and CSC-associated NKcell spectra from cell culture. The three phenotypes form the basis forthe distinction of cancer diagnosis in this study. Analysis of SERSspectra of human blood samples based on the similarity to the SERSspectra of NK cell activity using a simple machine learning algorithmwas undertaken. We hypothesize that the Raman signals of NK cellinteraction with cancer cells and CSCs can be detected from patient
blood. Thus, we ﬁrst cocultured NK cells with cancer cells, CSCs and
non-cancer cells and collected SERS signals using SERS functionalizedOncoImmune Probe Platform.
In this study, machine learning (ML) - a sub ﬁeld of arti ﬁcial intel-
ligence that has evolved rapidly in recent years was adopted for pre-diction. Unlike conventional techniques, ML techniques have thecapabilities of addressing complex problems involving massive com-binatorial spaces or nonlinear processes without incurring massivecomputational costs
33. We have explored the use of ML by adopting
the ML approach for cancer diagnosis, to address the complex mole-cular ﬁngerprinting of tumor-associated NK cells for prediction of
cancer. ML tools have consistently generated, tested, and re ﬁned sci-
entiﬁcm o d e l s
34,35. This family of statistics-based methods that can
make predictions of properties of molecules and materials withoutinvoking computationally demanding electronic structure calculationshas the potential to accelerate a variety of applications in chemical andmolecular sciences including Raman spectroscopy.

can interact simultaneously facilitating direct multiphoton ionization

37. MPI together with IB absorption created an electron ava-
lanche causing further ionization. As the duration of the pulse is muchshorter than the time taken by nickel electrons to conduct heat, thereis a phase change where the solid nickel becomes a super-heatedliquid. Above, the ablation threshold strong atomization and ioniza-tion of the super-heated liquid occurs and results in explosive boiling
of the liquid with subsequent vaporization. This phase change caused
an irreversible breakdown of the nickel crystalline structure into itsconstituent nickel ions, molecules, neutrals, and electrons. The kineticenergy of the ejected ions is considerably high, and the peak kineticenergy of nickel ions is estimated to be around 0.5 KeV

nitrogen, two observations were made. First, nitrogen gas increased
the condensation of vapor and resulted in the formation of smallernanoparticles, as there is less time for nuclear growth. Second, thefaster condensation and the supersaturated plasma increased thepressure within the plume and resulted in cubic-shaped nanoparticleswith sharp edges are formed. Under low-pressure oxygen gas, thetrend was reverse with multi-faceted roughly spherical nano shapesbeing produced with dimensions bigger compared to nanoparticlesmade with low-pressure nitrogen gas

Molecular level detection with OncoImmune probe platform
To detect a particular population of NK cells associated with a tumor,
we require an ultrasensitive sensor capable of detecting minute con-centrations in blood. Therefore, we evaluated the sensitivity of theprobe using the hematologically compatible leukocyte marker R6G(rhodamine 6 G) (Fig. 3a). As shown in Fig. 3b, the peaks at 612 cm
−1,
773 cm−1, 1126 cm−1, 1183 cm−1,1 3 1 3 c m−1,1 3 6 3 c m−1, 1513 cm−1and
1651 cm−1were evident. The detailed Raman assignment is presented in
Supplementary Table 2. We tested three probes to optimize the sensor.Figure 3e shows TEM images of the three types of probes. We observed
highest SERS ~ 650-fold with the probes with the smallest size (median
size 4.3 nm) and sharp cubical geometries. The medium-sized probes
(median size 5.13 nm) with partially rounded corners demonstrated~450-fold enhancement. The probes with the largest size (median size5.35 nm) with round geometries demonstrated lowest enhancement~430-fold enhancement. Although the size of the probes was instru-mental in increasing the surface area, the probes had a very similarparticle size distribution. Therefore, we hypothesize that the sub-stantial variation in the enhancement was due to the change in thegeometry (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b, e, f)).
As shown in Fig. 3b, the limit of detection of R6G was done with
varying concentrations of R6G and their corresponding SERS signal.
We used 1 × 10
−6,1×1 0−9,1×1 0−12,1×1 0−15and 1 × 10−18M concentrations
of R6G. The SERS intensity was observed for all the peaks except atattomolar concentrations. We were able to detect the Raman signal ofthe analyte in femtomolar range which is necessary for the rapiddetection of trace levels of tumor-associated NK cells. The SERSenhancement was substantially increased a combination of differentmechanisms that bring about intense SERS enhancement in the syn-thesized nickel probes (Fig. 3c, d). The interconnected nickel nanop-
robes geometries were capable of augmenting the electromagneticﬁeld through collective free electron oscillations
45, at resonant fre-
quency called localized surface plasmon (LSPR)46,47.M a x w e l l ’se q u a -
tion for electrical ﬁeld enhancement was solved for a de ﬁned boundary
condition using FDTD simulation48,49.T h e ﬁnite element simulation
model was created with ANSYS software to assess the electrical ﬁeld
strength in the proximity of nickel nanoprobes. The result obtained for5 nm nanoprobes in dielectric medium on irradiation with 532 nmexcitation source and 785 nm excitation source is presented in Sup-plementary Fig. 3a, b. The simulated data shows the average electricalﬁeld enhancement on the surface to be 0.485 eV and 0.461 eV for 532
and 785 nm excitation, respectively. The electrical ﬁeld enhancement
at a single hotspot (sharp edges of the cubes) were calculated to be2.73 eV and 2.62 eV at 532 and 785 nm respectively (Supplementary
Fig. 3a, b). The intensity of enhancement is directly proportional to the
fourth power of the amplitude of the electric ﬁeld ( E
elec)i nt h er e g i o n
of the probes ( EscatαEelec4). Additionally, when the number of probes
was increased, the electrical ﬁeld enhancement also increased sub-
stantially (1.4-fold with two probes). Therefore, the presence of hun-dreds of small probes in the laser spot will exponentially improve thesignal. This in addition to the presence of multiplicative chargetransfer resonance has resulted in substantially enhanced SERS.
The large surface area of the probe surface allows the adsorption
of molecules on the surface of the probe. R6G was used as analyte toinvestigate SERS activities of nickel nanostructures due to theirexcellent adsorption on the nickel surface
50. The adsorbed molecule in
contact with nickel nanoprobes displays charge transfer effect due to
Herzberg-Teller vibrionic coupling. The wavelength-dependent SERSshows selective enhancement of b2 modes of R6G molecule (Fig. 3d).
The Herzberg –Teller vibrionic coupling is brought by the interaction
of excited state (LUMO) of R6G molecule and fermi level electrons inArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-32308-x

virtual level of the molecule and charge transfer between metal andR6G molecule. As shown in supplementary Figure 3g, charge transfer isalso evident from the UV –V i sa b s o r p t i o ns p e c t r ao fR 6 Gm o l e c u l ew i t h
nickel nanoprobes compared to pure nickel probes and pure R6G. In
addition to the plasmonic and charge transfer mechanism, nickelmetal enhances the electromagnetic ﬁeld of NiO by forming a strong
local electric ﬁeld at Ni/NiO interface. Since the work function of Ni
(5.01 eV) is much smaller than NiO (5.2-6.2 eV), the electrons aretransferred from nickel to NiO, increasing the negative charge in theinterface close to NiO and equal positive charge in the interface closeto nickel. Metallic Ni in ﬂuence the near band-edge emission of NiO and
electrons from the interface move to conduction band. This increasedlocal electrical ﬁeld facilitates SERS
52. Additionally, the nickel nanop-
robes system has materials with various refractive indices (nickel is
~1.96, NiO is ~2.8 and air = 1)53. These varying refractive indices allow
multiple light scattering54and multiplication of Raman photons
thereby improving Raman enhancement55.
Additionally, the 3D interconnected networks have a critical
function in the overall SERS ampli ﬁcation. Multiple SERS active sites
were introduced due to the presen ce of 3D networks resulting in
localized surface plasmon resonance at the complex formation56.S E R S

OncoImmune probe platform assisted trapping and circulating
natural killer cell pro ﬁling for cancer diagnosis-CNKP
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells are composed of a diverse
array of immune cells, including T cells, NK cells, Dendritic cells, and
monocytes. We began by demonstrating the OncoImmune probeplatform capacity to discriminate between various types of PBMCs. Asseen in Fig. 4e, the spectra of diverse cell types exhibit unique char-
acteristic peaks. The spectra are distinguishable because of the distinctRaman shifts observed for different types of cells. The principal com-ponent analysis demonstrated clear clustering of cells into four sepa-rate groups (Fig. 4f). Additionally, the hierarchical cluster analysis
showed a dendrogram with distinct clustering (Fig. 4g). As a result, we
determined that NK cells may be recognized from other types ofimmune cells by their distinct characteristic spectra. PCA (Principal
Component Analysis) was used to characterize NK cells. PCA decreases
the dimensionality of data by decomposing the Raman spectra math-ematically into primary components. The ﬁrst principal component
showed a positive association between NK cells and all other cells and anegative correlation between all other cells (Fig. 4h). Using this feature,
we de ﬁned the NK cell signature ’s strongest peak in the PC1 loading
spectra (Fig. 4i). Then, PBMCs were mapped using Raman spectro-
scopy. As seen in Fig. 4j, we were able to successfully demonstrate the
presence of NK cells in the PBMC mixture. This investigation estab-lished unequivocally that circulating NK cells are capable of generatingdistinct NK cell signature spectra that are highly distinguishable fromall other PBMC spectra and may be utilized as a cancer detection
marker.
Next, we investigated the metabolic states of NK cells using NK-92
cell line and primary NK cells. Figure 4b shows signature Raman
spectra of NK-92 cell with characteristic bands from carbohydrates,proteins and lipids. Raman assignment of all biological peaks reportedin this study are tabulated in Supplementary Table 3. Noticeable peaks
are phenylalanine band at 1003 cm
−1, CH deformation at 1450 cm−1and
amide I at 1661 cm−1. However, the most distinct bands typical of
lymphocytes are seen at 1522 cm−1and 1158 cm−1belonging to
carotenoids59. Carotenoids are robust Raman scatterers and have
characteristic Raman spectra. The presence of carotenoids in NK cellsis an indication of cytotoxicity and cell surface activation. Otherspectral peaks originate from enzymes in the dense granules within thecytoplasm
60.F i g u r e 4d demonstrates heatmap of the holistic Raman
proﬁle of NK cells demonstrating correlated cellular biomolecules.
Supplementary Figure 4a show the primary NK cell spectra. The Ramanshifts of all major peaks of primary NK cell were identical to NK-92.Additionally, PCA was used to demonstrate the similarity betweenNK92 and primary NK cells. As can be observed from the PCA, the ﬁrst
three major components were merged into a single cluster for NK92
and primary NK cells, demonstrating the two cell types ’strong simi-
larities (Supplementary Fig. 4b).
NK cell function is dependent on the balance between inhibitory
and stimulatory signals received through interaction with tumor cells.When the stimulatory signals are more than the inhibitory signals, NKcells mediate the killing of tumor cells. Hence, NK cell cytotoxicity isaffected by the dynamic environment the cell interacts with. Inpatients with cancer, the number of NK cells is increased. However,quanti ﬁcation of NK cells is often a poor indicator of the cause and
severity of the disease. Therefore, we wanted to analyze the quality ofNK cell by investigating the metabolic state of NK cell to see the
changes in the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we hypothesize
that NK cells undergo metabolic changes on interaction with cancercells and CSCs. Our ﬁndings support our hypothesis that NK cells
faithfully reproduce the changes in tumor cellular environment. Weﬁnd that NK cells change from inactive to active and vice-versa upon
interaction with cancer cells and CSCs. The holistic analysis of mole-cular properties of the cells was possible due to the ef ﬁcient probe-cell
interaction. First, the 3D interconnected structures of the OncoIm-mune probe platform entrapped the cells (Fig. 4c). The surface func-
tionalization permitted cellular contact with the nanoprobes. Aspreviously shown in the XPS analysis, the presence of oxygen con-
taining groups such as –OH, C –O, C=O, C –OH incorporated on the
surface of the nanoprobes, instrumental in ef ﬁcient probe-cell
interaction
61–63. Substantially enhanced signal response was attrib-
uted to the ef ﬁcient probe-cell interaction.
Ultrasensitive detection wit h OncoImmune probe platform
assisted CNKP
NK cells have been known for their ability to selectively recognize and
kill CSCs. However, in circulation, the amount of CSC associated withNK cell is very less. Therefore, we need ultrasensitive sensor that candetect trace levels of tumor-educated NK cells in circulation. Surface-
enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) was adopted for ultrasensitive
detection. SERS-based methods, very useful for monitoring intracel-lular proteins and other macromolecules such as lipids and nucleicacids enabled intensive analysis of cellular biochemical composition
64.
SERS-based molecular ﬁngerprints at the sub-cellular level will allow
real-time information in a non-destructive way65. This marker-free
approach will be useful for the analysis of minute intracellularchanges
66. Variation in the biomolecular expression can be captured
by the OncoImmune probe platform very effectively. The ability of thesensor to detect the NK cells even at a single-cell level will enable thedetection of rare CSC-associated NK cell signals in circulation. To showsingle-cell sensitivity of Oncoimmune probe platform Raman spectra
of NK cells with serial dilution (from 100 NK cells in 10 µl to 1 NK cell in
10µL) was undertaken (Fig. 5a). As shown in Fig. 5b, the increase in
Raman intensity was directly proportional to the number of cellscaptured on the sensor. SERS intensity ratio I

cells demonstrating ability to detect cells at single-cell level. Supple-mentary Figure 5a shows TEM images of the platform taken at differentsites and a fair distribution of nanoparticles can be seen. An average of15 particles can be seen per random site ( n= 4, S.D 2.5) (supplementary
ﬁgure 5b). Additionally, to show the excellent reproducibility, the
relative standard deviation (RSD) was calculated using two SERS ana-lytes (crystal violet, methyl orange) and patient buffy sample. Byselecting 9 random spots, the RSD was calculated with 1176 cm
−1,
1111 cm−1and 1000 cm−1as the reference peak for crystal violet, methyl
orange and buffy sample, respectively. Supplementary Figure 6 shows
the uniform signal intensity with an RSD of 3.25 (crystal violet),3.92(methyl orange) and 10.98% (buffy). The high reproducibilityresulted in very low relative standard deviation demonstrating therobustness of this approach.
Applicability of cancer-associated NK cells for cancer diagnosis
We collected SERS spectral pro ﬁle data from three cancer-associated
NK-92 cells (breast carcinoma (MDA-MB231), small cell lung carcinoma(H69-AR) and Colorectal cancer (Colo 205) by co-culturing NK92 withcancer cells for 24 h. After 24 h, 5 µl of the cocultured and tumor-
associated NK-92 cells were dropped on the OncoImmune platform
a n dS E R Ss p e c t r a lp r o ﬁle was obtained using 785 nm wavelength.
Control NK-92 cells were grown separately, and SERS spectra wereobtained at 785 nm for comparison. The control NK-92 spectral pro ﬁle
for non-cancer-associated NK cells correlated with the previouslyreported SERS spectral pro ﬁles of NK cells
67,68. Casual observation of
the SERS spectra of tumor-associated NK cells and non-tumor-associated NK cells show unexpected differences between controla n dt u m o r - a s s o c i a t e dN Kc e l ls p e c t r aa n db e t w e e nt h ed i f f e r e n tcancer-associated NK cells spectra.
NK cells that are completely devoid of any tumor cell association
showed characteristic Raman spectra with characteristic bands from
carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids. This pro ﬁle can be correlated to
the NK cells in circulation. Figure 4(b) show the signature Raman
spectra of circulating NK cell. The band at CH deformation at 1450 cm
−1
and amide I at 1661 cm−1, amide II band at 1555 cm−1and amide III band
at 1337 cm−1can be seen. Other spectral features are disul ﬁde bonds
(S–S) between 500 and 550 cm−1and aromatic amino acids at 1004 cm−1
(from phenylalanine), 830 cm−1and 854 cm−1(from tyrosine doublets),
1340 cm−1of tryptophan69.
The spectral intensity of tumor-associated NK cells was slightly
altered compared to NK cells which have not associated with tumor
cells (Fig. 6a). A heatmap of circulating NK cell pro ﬁles indicates a small
difference in metabolic characteristics between NK cells associatedwith cancer and those not associated with cancer (Fig. 6b). This can be
due to NK cell recognition of tumor and switching to an active mode.Breast, lung, and colorectal cancers differ in their prognosis andtreatment outcome due to their different signaling mechanisms andmolecular pathways. Consequently, the immune responses varybetween different cancers. Signi ﬁcant changes take place at the cel-
lular level in NK cell activity with cancer cells as evidenced by the SERSproﬁle. Intracellular changes in NK cells due to upregulation or
downregulation of proteins are drivers of spectral changes. Onobservation of the SERS pro ﬁle, the major contributing metabolites in
breast cancer were disul ﬁde stretching proteins (increased), tyrosine
(decreased), phenylalanine (decreased), nucleic acids (decreased)corresponding to 521 cm
−1,8 5 4 c m−1, 1000 cm−1and 1662 cm−1,
respectively. These collective data show that NK cells associated withdifferent cancer types are different (Fig. 7a–c).The association of NK cells with tumor did not result in a homo-
genous signal as once thought of, rather they are uniquely hetero-genous with distinct subsets. Despite the presence of minordifferences, the principal component analysis (Fig. 6c) did not
demonstrate clear clustering between cancer and non-cancer-cell-
associated NK cells. The overlapping clusters can be possibly due tothe immune escape phenomenon exhibited by cancer cells on asso-ciation with NK cells resulting in the signals similar to the non-cancer-associated NK cell
70. We observed a strong negative correlation on the
dependence of NK cell SERS signature for diagnostic purpose withcancer cells (Fig. 6e). Since NK cells are preferentially cytotoxic to
CSCs, we hypothesized that NK cells associated with CSCs could pro-vide a better diagnostic signature when compared with non-cancer-associated NK cell.
Evaluation of CSC-associated NK cell for cancer diagnosis
We compared the metabolic pro ﬁle of CSC-associated NK-92 cells. The
major changes in NK-CSCs metabolites were a signi ﬁcantly decreased
disulﬁde stretching proteins, relative increase in quantity of nucleic
acids, decrease in tyrosine and phenylalanine, increase in glycogen andfatty acids and lipids, increase in carotenoids, phospholipids, cytosine,decrease in tryptophan corresponding to 521 cm
−1,7 8 7c m−1,8 5 4c m−1,
1000 cm−1,1 0 4 8 c m−1, 1137 cm−1, 1168 cm−1,1 2 6 8 c m−1,1 5 0 9 c m−1,
1339 cm−1. The decrease in the peak at 520 cm−1of NK cell in association
with CSCs indicate that NK-CSCs have regulated their Killer immu-noglobulin receptor (KIR) expression, suggesting a possible decrease
in MHC expression by CSCs. This paves way for increased cytotoxicity.
The loss or decreased expression of MHC in CSCs is correlated withbetter clinical outcomes and a promising strategy to reverse theimmune escape
71. The most distinct bands typical of lymphocytes are
seen at 1522 cm−1and 1158 cm−1belonging to carotenoids59.A sm e n -
tioned earlier, carotenoids are robust Raman scatterers and havecharacteristic Raman spectra. Dramatic changes in the pro ﬁle of CSC-
associated NK cells indicated the suitability of CSC-associated NK cellfor further analysis (Fig. 6e). One signi ﬁcant feature of this association
is that unlike cancer cells, CSCs are unable to escape immune detectionwith NK cell and their association is readily re ﬂected in their tumor
proﬁle. NK cells have a unique af ﬁnity for CSC as shown by many
studies where NK cells lyse and kill CSC population in mice. Theobserved spectra show the immune cell stimulated/inhibited statusupon interaction with the cancer cells. Several markers that are indi-cative of lymphocyte activation were identi ﬁed from the spectra. The
peak at 521 cm
−1is a disul ﬁde band suggestive of the formation of
immunoglobulins72. The disul ﬁde bonds are characteristic in Raman
spectra and appear distinct and separated from other peaks and helpin the conformation of protein. NK cells exhibit immunoglobulinreceptor protein on its surface KIR involved in the education of NK cell.A comparison of a heatmap of circulating NK cell and CSC-associated
NK cell shows substantial differences in metabolic characteristics
(Fig. 6f). Principal Component Analysis (Fig. 6g). show clear separation
of clusters between CSC-associated NK cells and non-tumor-associatedNK cells. K means clustering further con ﬁrmed the formation of clear
clusters (Fig. 6h).
NK cells have a major function in tumor control in early stages and
tumor progression in late stages. NK cells being the ﬁrst line of defect
against cancer, kill cancer cells without any prior sensitization. The NKcell also has a function in recruiting other immune cells into tumormicroenvironment. Their ability to sense the presence of tumor is byrecognizing the downregulation of MHC class molecule in stressedcells or tumor cells. NK cells preferentially kill these cells that show low
expression of MHC class 1 receptor. NK cell mimic normal cell behavior
when they interact with cancer cell (as seen with overlapping principalcomponents) due to their downregulation of MHC class I receptorleading NK cells to believe that cancer cells are a part of self. Thisimmune evasion is the hallmark of the cancer cell. On the other hand,Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-32308-x

we con ﬁrm that the use of CSC-associated NK cell would be ideal for
diagnostic purposes. The differences in the CSC-associated NK cell andcancer-associated NK cell spectra are reproducible and signi ﬁcant
(Fig. 7b, f and j) as seen with t-test. ( P<0 . 0 0 0 1 ) .
Principal component analysis demonstrated clear clustering of PC
scores con ﬁrming substantial variation in the signature of breast, lung
and colon CSC-associated NK cells compared to non-cancer-associatedNK cells (Fig. 7c, g and K). Our results clearly demonstrate the high
correlation of NK cells with CSCs and NK cell signatures re ﬂecting the
watchful vigilance of tumors by NK cells. Our results strongly show theplasticity of CSC-associated natural killer cells phenotypes with dif-ferent cancer types of CSCs re ﬂected in the circulation which can be
useful in cancer diagnosis. Similar to NK-92 cells, SERS spectra of pri-mary NK cells demonstrate a similar pattern on interaction with CSCs
of breast, lung and colorectal (Supplementary Fig. 4c). Supplementary
Figure 4d shows the principal component analysis demonstratingclear separation of clusters between CSCs and non-cancer cellsusing the spectra of primary NK cells cocultured with CSCs. This fur-ther established that even primary NK cells demonstrate CSC-speci ﬁc
activity.
We also looked at how tumor-associated NK cells in-vitro com-
pared to the NK cells from real patients. As shown in SupplementaryFigure 7a, the spectra of NK cells from cell culture and patient-derivedNK cells demonstrated similar Raman shifts. (For breast cancer (Sup-plementary Fig. 7a), the wavenumbers for the peaks at 1001 cm

the intensities of some Raman shifts. Multivariate analysis (principalcomponent analysis) was undertaken. The scatter plot of PC1 Vs PC2 VsPC3 with principal component analysis demonstrated clustering ofboth types of cells in one single cluster for breast cancer as well as forlung cancer (Supplementary Fig. 7d, e). The cells will form separateclusters if there is discrimination observed in the cells with PCA.Therefore, we concluded that the evaluation of tumor-associated NK
cells in culture and the NK cells of actual cancer patients demonstrated
strong similarity to one another.
Prediction of tumor-associated nk cells for cancer diagnosis
directly with patient blood —without cellular isolation
Next, we assessed the diagnostic accuracy of CNKP classi ﬁcation by
collecting SERS spectra from 22 clinical samples obtained fromOntario Tumor Board (OTB). Peripheral blood from cancer patientsdiagnosed by clinical presentation and histopathological diagnosiswas processed to extract the buffy coat layer by density gradientcentrifugation. The patient cohort had three tumor types consisting of
breast adenocarcinoma ( n= 8), lung carcinoma ( n= 7) and colorectal
carcinoma ( n= 7) as shown in Supplementary Table 4. 5 µLo fb u f f y
coat was dropped on the sensor and SERS spectra were taken at785 nm wavelength. Partial least squares regression —discriminant
analysis was done to discriminate healthy and tumor samples (Fig. 8b).
Brieﬂy, PLSDA is a supervised machine learning analysis that
identi ﬁes features that contribute to the most variation. The PLSDA
models with cross validation was able to discriminate two clusters(R
2= 0.9) and showed excellent discriminatory power with 100% sen-
sitivities and speci ﬁcities and correctly predicted the samples as
healthy or having cancer. We did a principal component analysis toﬁnd if the input data was discrete or not and subsequently the discrete
dataset from NK cells associated with CSCs were used as training input
data for the PLSDA analysis. For subsequent training of the algorithm,we used the patient ’s buffy coat cohort as input for validation data. The
results generated 100% accuracy, 100% precision, 100% speci ﬁcity and
100% sensitivity and prediction of 1.0, Area under the curve = 1 with R
2for calibration as 0.99 and R2for prediction as 0.96 (Fig. 8e). In con-
trast, the training data from NK cells associated with cancer cellsduring training with PLSDA yielded very poor prediction with accuracyof 28%, sensitivity of 9% and speci ﬁcity of 50% showing the predictive
power of NK cells associated with CSCs as compared to NK cells
associated with cancer cells (Fig. 8g).
The molecular analysis of PLSDA provided basis for classi ﬁcation.
As per Supplementary Fig. 8a, the Variable of importance scores (VIPscores) of vibrational peaks with the VIP score > = 1 were plotted. Morenumber of peaks assigned to nucleic acids as well as proteins wereevident in the VIP score plot. The loadings of latent variables alsodemonstrated that the peaks for nucleic acids, proteins as well as lipidswere responsible for complete clustering without ambiguity for cancervs non-cancer. This also demonstrated the critical features of holisticanalysis of NK cell spectra for accurate cancer diagnosis.
Localization of cancer using OncoImmune probe platform
based CNKP directly with patient blood —without cellular
isolation
In addition to cancer diagnosis, tumor-associated NK SERS pro ﬁle can
distinguish healthy and patients with different types of cancer. Unsu-pervised principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysiscan unambiguously discriminate healthy or non-cancer-associated NKcells and three individual tumor varieties i.e., breast, lung and color-ectal (Fig. 9a, b) to give tumor speci ﬁc SERS spectral wavenumbers that
were used as training and validation data inputs for tissue of origin
algorithms. Supplementary Figure 4e shows Primary NK cells having
cancer-speci ﬁc behavior. On co-culturing with CSCs of various tumor
types, clear clustering was observed with principal component analy-sis. Supplementary Figure 9 shows signals of primary NK cells cocul-tured with CSC derived from cancer patients also con ﬁrmed the
applicability of NK cells for cancer diagnosis. Identi ﬁcation of tumor
location was possible with molecular analysis of tumor-associated NK(primary) as shown in Supplementary Fig. 10. Using MCR scores andSVM discriminative analysis of the tumor-associated NK cells, weidenti ﬁed sensitivity of 100%, speci ﬁcity of 86%, accuracy 93% and
precision of 88% for colorectal vs breast cancer and sensitivity of 100%,
speci ﬁcity of 83%, accuracy 88% and precision of 93% for colorectal vs
lung cancer and sensitivity of 63%, speci ﬁcity of 72%, accuracy 72% and
precision of 67% for breast vs lung cancer allowing multilevel diagnosisacross different tumors (Fig. 9d). An accuracy of 86% and 72%
demonstrated satisfactory results in terms of diagnostic tool for can-cer. The low speci ﬁcity can be attributed to intra tumor variation. Such
liquid biopsy will radically change the direction of cancer diagnosis formultiple types of cancer on validation in large cohort studies.
Validation of the differential SERS expression seen in cancer and
CSC interacted NK cells and healthy NK cells using RT-qPCR and
glycolysis stress test
To validate the proposed method of SERS to detect changes in NK cell
signatures between cancer and CSC interacted NK cells and healthy NKcells, two studies were undertaken. First, we analyzed the relativemRNA expression levels of BCL2 through RT-qPCR. BCL2 (B cell lym-
phoma 2) gene encodes the BCL2 family of regulatory proteins that is
responsible for the regulation of apoptosis. BCL2 inﬂuenced tumor-
associated changes in immune cells favor the downregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins resulting in resistance to NK cell-mediated cellcytotoxicity
73.T h ee x p r e s s i o no f BCL2 is an activation/proliferation
marker in the NK cells74. NK cells have increased expression of BCL2 ,
favouring immune escape by the cancer cells. However, the trend is
reversed in the presence of CSCs as NK cells have zero or reduced
expression of BCL2 favouring apoptosis and killing of cancer cells74.
The results of RT-qPCR, following ANOVA (Analysis of variance), showthat the expression of BCL2 genes was signi ﬁcantly upregulated in NK
cells cocultured with cancer cells compared to control NK cellsArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-32308-x

Nature Communications |         (2022) 13:4527 15(P< 0.0001). NK cells cocultured with CSCs showed signi ﬁcant
downregulation of BCL2 gene expression when compared to control
NK cells ( P< 0.001). Thus, there is a substantial difference between the
expression levels of NK cells cocultured with cancer and CSCs. These
results imply that CSC interacted NK cells are genotypically different
from cancer interacted NK cells. Next, to compare the results of RT-qPCR with SERS, signature peaks of BCL2 were identi ﬁed, and Raman
intensity was calculated, and compared with cancer, CSC interactedNK cells and healthy NK cells. As shown in Fig. 10a, b, the Raman
experiment also demonstrated a similar trend of BCL2 gene expression
as the conventional RT-qPCR.
Second, NK cells have to compete with tumor cells in a nutrient-
depleted environment for glucose and amino acids. NK cells, there-fore, exhibit the ‘Immune Warburg phenomenon ’and metabolic
switch to aerobic glycolysis
75–77. In order to investigate the glycolytic
reprogramming in CSC-associated NK cells, we undertook a glycolysis
stress test for glycolytic characterization in live NK cells using glyco-lysis assay (ABCAM ab222946). Quanti ﬁcation of glycolysis was
undertaken as per the manufacturer ’s protocol. The signature peaks at
866 cm
−1and 835 cm−1, corresponding to lactate and pyruvate,
respectively, were used to detect glycolytic reprogramming that givesrise to distinct Raman metabolic signature. The intensity of peaks forglycolysis reprogramming demonstrated the lowest intensity for lung-cancer-associated NK cells. The intensity was higher for breast-cancer-associated NK cells as compared to lung cancer, but it also showedmuch lower intensity as compared to control NK cells. The results of
these observations are shown in Fig. 10e, f.
We have successfully demonstrated the feasibility of adopting
signals re ﬂecting changes in the metabolic pro ﬁle of Natural Killer
cell (NK cell) during tumor-associated NK cell activation, for cancerdiagnosis. Pro ﬁling of tumor-associated circulating NK cell activity
(CNKP) was introduced as a pathway for cancer diagnosis withliquid biopsy. Experimental demonstration of dissimilar pro ﬁles
between cancer-associated NK cells and CSC-associated NK cellswith statistical signi ﬁcance was achieved. This was instrumental in
demonstration of the crucial function of CSC-associated NK cells incancer diagnosis. Molecular signatures of CNKP were cancer-type
speci ﬁc. This property of tumor-associated NK cells was in ﬂuential
in the prediction of tumor location. SERS functionalized OncoIm-mune probe platform with small scaled probes was designed for thismarker-free approach. We achieved ultralow concentrations (up tofemtomolar 10
−15M of analyte molecules). This was attributed to the
conﬁguration of probes by narrowing of the atomic scale probe
apices, instrumental in the improvement of localized surface plas-mon resonance. The 3D arrangements of the nanoprobes ensuredNK cell trapping, critical in signal ampli ﬁcation and transmission.
Highly reproducible signals were achieved. CNKP of three hard-to-detect cancer-cell lines (triple negative breast adenocarcinoma,
small cell lung cancer, colorectal adenocarcinoma) was achieved
with single-cell sensitivity. We were able to identify cancer fromnon-cancer using very small amount of peripheral blood (5 µL) with
100% prediction accuracy using machine learning model trainedwith SERS signals of NK cell activity in cell culture. Prediction oftumor location achieved prediction accuracy of up to 93%. Thisapproach overcomes lack of patients by using data from easy tocollect cell culture and by identifying the similarity of the featuresof NK cell activity in patient blood (without cell isolation) throughmachine learning. This method also provides a basis for classi ﬁca-
tion. As cell culture data was used for training, multivariate analysesof cell-culture data provided an explainable basis. Such liquid
biopsy using OncoImmune probe platform-based SERS has poten-
tial to radically change the direction of cancer diagnosis for multi-ple types of cancer on validation in large cohort studies. This worksets the stage in advancing the knowledge of tumor-associated NKcells and its use in liquid biopsy.Methods
Clinical sample acquisition
This study was conducted in accordance with Ryerson Ethics Board ofRyerson University (REB 2020-275). Informed written consent and
blood samples from cancer patients were obtained by Ontario Tumor
Bank (OTB). The buffy coat was extracted by density gradient cen-trifugation. The Details on the clinical features, gender and demo-graphic data are provided in Supplementary Table 4.
Cell culture
The primary NK cells (Stem cell technologies) and NK-92 cell line(derived from non-Hodgkin lymphoma) were obtained from AmericanTissue Type Culture Collection (ATCC, USA) and maintained in Alphaminimum essential medium w/o nucleosides (catalog no 36453) with0.2 mM myo-inositol, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.02 mM folic acid,
12.5% horse serum and 12.5% fetal bovine serum. To maintain suf ﬁcient
proliferation IL-2 (catalog no 78036_c) was added at 150 IU/ml. Cancer-cell lines were similarly obtained from ATCC for breast adenocarci-noma (MDA-MB231), non-small lung carcinoma (H69 AR) and colonadenocarcinoma (Colo 205). Breast-cancer-cell line was maintainedwith DMEM with 10%FBS. The lung and colon cancer-cell lines weremaintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS. All cells were cultured at 37 C in5% CO
2atmosphere.
Synthesis of OncoImmune probe platform
Nickel sheets measuring 2 (w) × 12 (l) × 0.019 (h) inches were purchased
from McMaster-Carr. The sheets were cut into 2 (l) × 1.5(w) inches
toﬁt in the laser system. The nickel sheets were supported on
stand for laser ablation. Femtosecond, Yb-doped ﬁber ampli ﬁed;
Clark MXR IMPULSE laser was used for the synthesis of nanoparticles.The following parameters were used: laser pulse width —214 fs, repe-
tition rate —25 MHz, laser wavelength —1030 nm and power —14 W.
EzCAD2 software was used to design the ablation area. The designof the ablation from the software transferred to the nickel sheetthrough piezoelectric scanner, with a scanning speed of 1 mm/sec.Nitrogen gas and oxygen gas were introduced separately in the abla-tion area using six Master ﬂex tubes secured on square bracket. The
pressure was kept at 2 bar. The laser pulse interacts with nickel sub-
strate at 90 degrees and the ablation plume interacted with thebackground nitrogen gas. The diagnostic probes then deposit on thesubstrate.
Co-culture assays
NK-92 cells were cocultured with three cancer-cell lines using transwellapparatus (0.4 μm pore size, corning, Lowell, MA). NK-92 cells were
seeded in the upper insert of 24 well transwell plate. The cancer-celllines were seeded in three separate lower chambers. CSCs were grownseparately prior to the assay in a serum-free media using ultralow low
attachment plates. Tumor spheroids were veri ﬁed in microscope and
seeded in a set of other low chambers. After 24 h of co-culture, the NK-92 cells were centrifuged and resuspended in water for SERS analysis.NK cells grown separately without co-culture with cancer-cell lineswere used as control.
RT-qPCR
RNA was extracted from the cell pellets by the Trizol /chloroform(Invitrogen) extraction method and resuspended in diethylpyr-ocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water. RNA concentrations and ratios weredetermined photometrically (Nanodrop). The expression levels ofBCL2 were assessed by RT-qPCR using one step PCR (New England
Biolab E3005G NEB). Primer sequence Forward GGATGCTTTAT and
reverse GCTTTATTTCATGAG. RT-qPCR reactions were performed on96-well plates (Micro Amp ®Fast Optical 96-well reaction plate with
barcode; ABI, Foster City, CA, USA). The relative expression levels oftarget genes were expressed as fold-change against housekeepingArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-32308-x

Raman data acquisition
5μl of buffy coat (blood) and 10 μl of cultured NK-92 cells were
dropped on the OncoImmune probe platform. After 1 min (to allowtrapping of NK-92 cells in the sensor mesh), Raman spectral scanningwas done at 785 nm wavelength. A minimum of 10 spectra and 3acquisitions were made with laser power at 5 W. The spectra werecollectively saved and processed using Spectragryph soft-ware (V.1.2.9).
Data analysis
The NK-92 cell-culture data were given as training data and the spectrafrom buffy coat were given as validation data. Data was collected in
Excel ﬁles and Partial least squares regression analysis was done after
doing multivariate analysis. PLSDA analysis was done using PLS Tool-box software (SOLO V 9.0). For the localization of cancer, data frombuffy coat of known patient samples were used to train the algorithm.The statistical analysis for all the results is indicated in the ﬁgure
legends. All data are represented as mean ± S.D. For SERS analysis twotailed Student ’sttest was performed. P< 0.05 was considered sig-
niﬁcant. Experimental results were done at least three times, unless
stated otherwise in ﬁgure legends.
