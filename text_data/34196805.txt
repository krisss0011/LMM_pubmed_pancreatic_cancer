Purpose:Intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm is a rare pancreatic tumor. The purpose of this study was to clarify the recurrence type and prognosis in recurrent cases after intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm resection.Methods:PubMed was searched for previous reports on surgical resection of intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas that were published from 2009 to July 2020. The clinical features obtained from these reports were summarized and analyzed.Results:The clinicopathological data of 35 intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm cases were obtained. Of these, 21 were males, and 14 were females, with an average age of 57.9 years old. Invasive findings were observed in 21 of 35 patients (60%). Recurrence was observed in 11 of the 35 cases (31.4%), including remnant pancreatic recurrence in 6 cases (17.1%) and liver metastasis in 5 cases (14.3%). The tumor size was significantly larger in the liver metastasis group than in the remnant pancreas recurrence group (P = 0.04), and patients with liver metastases tended to have a poorer prognosis than those with remnant pancreas recurrence.Conclusions:The recurrence type of intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm resection was mainly remnant pancreatic recurrence and liver metastasis recurrence. Total pancreatectomy for remnant pancreatic recurrence may be suitable because of its good prognosis.
