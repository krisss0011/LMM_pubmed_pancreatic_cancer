Background/aim:Gemcitabine (GEM)-induced vascular pain often occurs in patients. A 5% glucose solution for the lyophilized formulation of GEM solvent is known to decrease the frequency of GEM-induced vascular pain compared with saline. In this study, we aimed to examine the availability of glucose for a liquid formulation GEM solvent for the prevention of GEM-induced vascular pain.Patients and methods:In total, 214 patients with bile tract or pancreatic cancer, who received GEM-containing regimens, were enrolled in this retrospective study. The patients were divided into a glucose group, which was administered the liquid formation GEM diluted with glucose, and a saline group. The frequency of GEM-induced vascular pain was compared between them.Results:Glucose significantly decreased the frequency of GEM-induced vascular pain during the first GEM administration (36% vs. 55%, p=0.005).Conclusion:Switching the solution for liquid formulation GEM from saline to glucose significantly decreased the frequency of vascular pain.
