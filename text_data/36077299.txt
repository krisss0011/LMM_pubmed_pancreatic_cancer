Pancreatic cancer has a high mortality rate due to its aggressive nature and high metastatic rate. When coupled to the difficulties in detecting this type of tumor early and the lack of effective treatments, this cancer is currently one of the most important clinical challenges in the field of oncology. Melitherapy is an innovative therapeutic approach that is based on modifying the composition and structure of cell membranes to treat different diseases, including cancers. In this context, 2-hydroxycervonic acid (HCA) is a melitherapeutic agent developed to combat pancreatic cancer cells, provoking the programmed cell death by apoptosis of these cells by inducing ER stress and triggering the production of ROS species. The efficacy of HCA was demonstrated in vivo, alone and in combination with gemcitabine, using a MIA PaCa-2 cell xenograft model of pancreatic cancer in which no apparent toxicity was evident. HCA is metabolized by Î±-oxidation to C21:5n-3 (heneicosapentaenoic acid), which in turn also showed anti-proliferative effect in these cells. Given the unmet clinical needs associated with pancreatic cancer, the data presented here suggest that the use of HCA merits further study as a potential therapy for this condition.
