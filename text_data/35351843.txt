Introduction:The ability of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) to differentiate pancreatic cancer from other benign pancreatic lesions is unsatisfactory. This study explored the diagnostic value of KRAS gene mutations and plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in patients with pancreatic cancer.Methods:The prospective cohort study comprised 149 consecutive patients with solid pancreatic lesions who underwent endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). KRAS subtype mutations were analyzed by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) in EUS-FNA histopathology tissue samples, and blood samples were sent for plasma ctDNA analysis. The final diagnosis was based on surgical resection pathology or follow-up for at least 2 years.Results:Adding KRAS mutation ddPCR increased the sensitivity and accuracy of EUS-FNA from 71.4% to 91.6% (P < 0.001) and 75.8% to 88.6% (P < 0.001), respectively. By comparison, the sensitivities of circulating biomarkers ctDNA and CA19-9 were only 35.2% and 71.2%. The area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of EUS-FNA and KRAS ddPCR combination was >0.90 for distinguishing pancreatic cancer from benign lesions, whereas the AUC of EUS-FNA and CA19-9 combination was 0.83. The median survival time was significantly shorter in patients with G12D KRAS mutations than that in patients with other mutations (180 vs 240 days, P < 0.001).Discussion:FNA tissue sample KRAS mutation analysis in tissues significantly improves the diagnostic accuracy of cyto/histopathological evaluation in EUS-FNA samples. The combination of EUS-FNA and tissue sample KRAS ddPCR provided a more accurate method for pancreatic cancer diagnosis, superior to the combination of EUS-FNA and CA19-9/ctDNA. G12D KRAS mutations in pancreatic cancer were independently associated with poor overall survival.
