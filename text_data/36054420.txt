Hepatic, biliary and pancreatic cancers are a diverse set of malignancies with poor prognoses. It is possible that common molecular mechanisms are involved in the carcinogenesis of these cancers. Here, we identified LINC01537 and seven protein-coding genes by integrative analysis of transcriptomes of mRNAs, microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs from cholangiocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma cohorts in TCGA. A predictive model constructed from seven biomarkers was established to successfully predict the survival rate of patients, which was then further verified in external cohorts. Additionally, patients with high-risk scores in our model were prone to epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Finally, activation of the biomarker PDE2A significantly attenuated migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in the HepG2 liver cancer cell line.
