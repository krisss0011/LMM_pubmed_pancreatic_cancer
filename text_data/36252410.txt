Background:Pancreatic cancer is considered a lethal disease and the only potentially curative option is R0 excision. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the waiting time interval from diagnosis to surgical treatment affects overall survival in patients who undergo curative-intent surgery for pancreatic cancer.Methods:Search in Medline, Scopus, Clinicaltrials.gov, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials CENTRAL and Google Scholar databases was conducted from inception until April 2022.Results:Overall, 10 studies were included that enrolled 181,344 patients. The dominating cut-off time point was 4 weeks in studies which utilized a biphasic waiting time pattern. In addition, prolonged waiting time interval was associated with decreased overall survival in 3 studies, whereas it demonstrated a favorable effect on overall survival in 2 studies and no impact on survival in 5 studies.Conclusion:The great diversity that was observed regarding the impact of surgery delay on survival underlines the lack of knowledge about biologic pathways of pancreatic cancer. Novel imaging studies and molecular "fingerprints" in combination to time-to-treatment standardization in the design of future randomized trials could lead to the recognition of patients that could benefit from a timely resection.
