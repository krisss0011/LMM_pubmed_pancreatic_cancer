Male genitourinary neuroendocrine neoplasms (GU-NENs) are rare, without any definite imaging characteristics. The WHO classified neuroendocrine neoplasms in the 2016 classification of the tumors of the urinary tract and genital organs along with other GU tumors; however, no pathologic grading system is available as published for gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms. Often a multimodality approach using cross-sectional imaging techniques, such as molecular imaging and histopathology are implemented to arrive at the diagnosis. This article provides a review of the pathology and imaging features of the male GU-NENs.
