Background:Pancreatic cancer is still considered one of the most aggressive types of cancer and is associated with a very poor prognosis although there have been improvements in diagnostics and chemotherapy regimes in recent years. A cure can only be achieved through complete resection which is only possible when diagnosed at a very early stage, though this is rarely the case. We report on a patient with stage IV adenocarcinoma of the pancreas in which several therapeutically actionable mutations could be detected and discuss new options of targeted therapies.Case report:A patient in his 50s was diagnosed with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. The patient showed an excellent response to platinum-based chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOX. When a germline mutation in the BRCA-2 gene could be identified, he took part in the POLO-study receiving a maintenance therapy with the PARP-Inhibitor Olaparib. Due to a relapse, 2nd and 3rd line chemotherapy regimens were applied with Gemcitabine combined with Nab-Paclitaxel and later with Erlotinib. Although an activating mutation in the KRAS-gene could be detected as well, the patient rejected further experimental treatment.Conclusion:Identifying predictive factors and specific targetable mutations in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer is needed to be able to apply more individual and specific therapies in order to improve outcomes.
