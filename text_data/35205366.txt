Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the seventh leading cause of cancer death worldwide; most of cases are sporadic, however about 5% to 10% report a hereditary predisposition. Several hereditary syndromes have been associated with familial pancreatic cancer (FPC) onset, including hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC), Lynch syndrome (LS), Familial atypical multiple mole melanoma (FAMMM), Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS), and Hereditary pancreatitis (HP).The aim of this study was to determine the mutational status of a cohort of 56 HBOC families, 7 LS families, 3 FAP and FAMMM families, and 1 LFS family with at least one case of PDAC. Mutation analysis ofBRCA1/2, ATM, CHEK2, PALB2, RAD51C, RAD51D, NBN, CDH1, TP53, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6,andPMS2genes, showedmutation inBRCA1/2, MLH1, andAPCgenes. We founda high mutation rate in patients belong HBOC and LS families, with a percentage of 28.6% in both syndromes and prevalence in HBOC ofBRCA2mutations with one case of double mutation inBRCA2gene. In FAP family, we found a pathogenic mutation inAPCgene in 1/3 families. We observed an early onset of PDAC and a lower survival in PDAC patients belonging to mutated families, while no evidence of possible pancreatic cancer cluster regions was found. Moreover, we identified a novelBRCA2germline mutation, c.5511delT (p.Phe1837LeufsX3), not reported in any database, that segregated with disease in HBOC patients. Mutational analysis was extended to family membersof mutated patients, both healthy and cancer affected, which revealed 23 unaffected family members that inherited the proband's mutation. Although correlative by its nature, the presence of aBRCAmutation in PDAC patients may have benefits in terms of optimized treatment and longer outcome.
