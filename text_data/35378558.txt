Despite advances in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, the survival of affected patients remains limited. A more radical surgical therapy could help to improve the prognosis, in particular by reducing the local recurrence rate, which is around 45% in patients with resected pancreatic cancer. In addition, patients with oligometastatic pancreatic cancer could also benefit from a more radical indication for surgery.Based on an analysis of the literature, important principles of pancreatic cancer surgery were examined.Even if even more radical surgical approaches such as an "extended" lymphadenectomy or a standard complete pancreatectomy do not bring any survival advantage, complete resection of the tumour (R0), a thorough locoregional lymphadenectomy and an adequate radical dissection in the area of the peripancreatic vessels including periarterial nerve plexuses should be the standard of pancreatic carcinoma resections. Whenever necessary to achieve an R0 resection, resections of the pancreas have to be extended, as well as additional venous vascular resections and multivisceral resections had to be performed. Simultaneous arterial vascular resections as part of pancreatic resections as well as surgical resections in oligometastatic patients should, however, be reserved for selected patients. These aspects of the surgical technique in pancreatic carcinoma mentioned above must not be neglected from the point of view of an "existing limited prognosis". On the contrary, they form the absolutely necessary basis in order to achieve good survival results in combination with system therapy. However, it may always be necessary to adapt these standards according to the age, comorbidities and wishes of the patient.
