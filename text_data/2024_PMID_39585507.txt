While pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PA) incidence is increasing, especially in 
France, the association between pesticides and PA remains unclear. The aims of 
this study were to assess the spatiotemporal distribution of the incidence of PA 
in France between 2011 and 2021 and to determine whether pesticide exposure was 
associated with higher risk of PA. We employed a disease-mapping and ecological 
regression approach with medicoadministrative data covering 99% of the French 
population. Exposure data were drawn from an open purchase database. A pesticide 
exposure intensity index (PEXI), defined as the logged and scaled median of the 
ratio quantity of substance over agricultural surface per spatial unit was used 
for total quantity (total PEXI) and 9 specific substances. The analyses were 
adjusted for tobacco-induced diseases, deprivation, community medicine 
accessibility, alcohol-related disease and morbid obesity. A Bayesian 
hierarchical spatiotemporal model was used to both model the incidence over time 
and space, and to estimate the risk of PA for pesticide use. We identified 
134 102 incident cases of PA between 2011 and 2021. The relative risk of PA was 
heterogeneous across space with greater risk around Paris, central France and 
the Mediterranean coast. We observed an association, albeit small, between the 
total PEXI and PA incidence over the study period (RR: 1.0130; CI95% 
[1.0057;1.0204]). Sulphur for spraying, mancozeb, and glyphosate showedevidence 
of an association of the same magnitude. These findings show that new cases of 
PA occur heterogeneously in space, raising questions about our understanding of 
PA environmental risk factors. The association with pesticide exposure should be 
confirmed and underlying mechanisms understood using individual-level studies.
