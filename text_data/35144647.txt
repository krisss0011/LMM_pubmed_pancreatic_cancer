Background:Factors associated with long-term survival in gemcitabine-concurrent proton radiotherapy (GPT) for non-metastatic, locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) remain unclear. This study aimed to determine the factors associated with long-term survival in GPT for non-metastatic LAPC.Methods:The medical records of 123 patients with LAPC treated with GPT between February 2009 and December 2019 at Hyogo Ion Beam Medical Center were retrospectively reviewed to assess the factors associated with long-term survival outcomes.Results:The median overall survival of the total cohort treated with GPT was 18.7 months. The 1- and 2-year overall, local progression-free, and progression-free survival rates were 70.4% and 35.7%, 78.2% and 59.0%, and 38.6% and 20.8%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that LAPCs at the pancreatic body-tail and those without anterior peripancreatic invasion were independently associated with longer overall survival (P = 0.040 and P = 0.015, respectively). The median overall survival of patients with LAPC at the pancreatic body-tail and those with LAPC without anterior peripancreatic invasion were 24.1 and 28.1 months, respectively. LAPCs at the pancreatic body-tail had a higher volume ratio irradiated over 60 Gy equivalents at gross tumor volume than those at the pancreatic head (P < 0.001). LAPCs with anterior peripancreatic invasion had more peritoneal recurrence within 6 months after GTP than those without anterior peripancreatic invasion (P = 0.039).Conclusions:GPT is a promising treatment option for patients with LAPC at the pancreatic body-tail and those with LAPC without anterior peripancreatic invasion.
