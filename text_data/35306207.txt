Recent technological advances have enabled 3D tissue culture models for fast and affordable HTS. We are no longer bound to 2D models for anti-cancer agent discovery, and it is clear that 3D tumor models provide more predictive data for translation of preclinical studies. In a previous study, we validated a microplate 3D spheroid-based technology for its compatibility with HTS automation. Small-scale screens using approved drugs have demonstrated that drug responses tend to differ between 2D and 3D cancer cell proliferation models. Here, we applied this 3D technology to the first ever large-scale screening effort completing HTS on over 150K molecules against primary pancreatic cancer cells. It is the first demonstration that a screening campaign of this magnitude using clinically relevant, ex-vivo 3D pancreatic tumor models established directly from biopsy, can be readily achieved in a fashion like traditional drug screen using 2D cell models. We identified four unique series of compounds with sub micromolar and even low nanomolar potency against a panel of patient derived pancreatic organoids. We also applied the 3D technology to test lead efficacy in autologous cancer associated fibroblasts and found a favorable profile for better efficacy in the cancer over wild type primary cells, an important milestone towards better leads. Importantly, the initial leads have been further validated in across multiple institutes with concordant outcomes. The work presented here represents the genesis of new small molecule leads found using 3D models of primary pancreas tumor cells.
