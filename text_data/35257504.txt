Previously published digital autoradiography of3H-labeled capecitabine reveals a near-uniform distribution of activity throughout a murine pancreatic model. This is in contrast both to14C-labeled gemcitabine, and established expectations, as the dense stroma of pancreatic cancer is understood to inhibit drug penetration. Capecitabine is a pro-drug for 5 FU. The positioning of the radiolabel on capecitabine leaves open the possibility that much of the autoradiographic signal is generated by nontoxic compounds. Studies were performed on tumors derived via organoid culture from a murine KPC tumor. As before, we performed autoradiography comparing3H capecitabine to the gemcitabine analog18F-FAC. The metabolism of capecitabine in this model was studied through LC-MS of tumor tissue. The autoradiographs confirmed that the3H label from capecitabine was much more uniformly distributed through the tumor than the18F from the gemcitabine analog. LC-MS revealed that approximately 75% of the molar mass of capecitabine had been converted into 5 FU or pre-5 FU compounds. The remainder had been converted into nontoxic species. Therapeutically relevant capecitabine metabolites achieve a relatively even distribution in this pancreatic cancer model, in contrast to the gemcitabine analog18F-FAC. In a human xenograft model, (BxPC3), the3H label from capecitabine was also uniformly spread across the tumor autoradiographs. However, at 2 h post-administration the metabolism of capecitabine had proceeded further and the bulk of the agent was in the form of nontoxic species.
