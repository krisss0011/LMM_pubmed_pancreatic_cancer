Background:Pancreatic cancer surgery is associated with high incidence of short- and long-term morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to assess whether the hospital volume of pancreatic surgery is associated with better survival in a population-based setting.Methods:All patients who underwent pancreatic resection for cancer in Finland during 1997-2016 were identified from nationwide registries. The follow-up ended on 31 December 2019. Patients were divided into quintiles based on annual hospital volume (4-year moving average): ≤4, 5-9, 10-18, 19-36 and ≥ 37 resections per year. Cox regression provided hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusted for age, sex, comorbidity and year of surgery.Results:The number of diagnosed pancreatic cancers was 22,724. Of these, 1514 underwent pancreatic surgery due to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The 5-year survival ranged from 12% to 28%, increasing with higher annual operative volume. Adjusted 5-year mortality was higher in all other quintiles compared to the highest annual volume quintile (HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.16-1.75). Thirty and 90-day mortality were higher in the three lowest volume, compared to the highest quintile.Conclusion:Higher annual hospital volume of pancreatic surgery for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is associated with improved short- and long-term survival.
