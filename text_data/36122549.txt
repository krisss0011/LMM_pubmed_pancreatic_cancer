The natural product diphyllin has demonstrated great potential in the treatment of various human cancers, especially pancreatic cancer. However, its relative weak potency, low aqueous solubility, and poor metabolic stability limits its development ability. In this study, we designed and synthesized two series of novel nitrogen-containing diphyllin derivatives with the aim to improve both antitumor efficacy and drug-like properties. Among them, the amino derivative 15 showed an IC50value of 3 nM against pancreatic cancer CFPAC-1 cells and is about 69-fold more potent than diphyllin. In addition, compound 15 possesses improved aqueous solubility and metabolic stability in liver microsomes. This compound not only significantly induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase with down-regulation of CDK4 and cyclinD1 in a dose-dependent manner, but also blocked the later stage of autophagy in CFPAC-1 cells. In pancreatic cancer xenograft model, treatment of 15 with 10 mg/kg exhibited much more potent efficacy in suppressing the growth of transplanted PANC02 tumors than diphyllin without obvious safety concern.
