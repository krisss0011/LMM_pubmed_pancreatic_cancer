A recent Nature study delineates a stepwise genomic evolution during pancreatic cancer development, employing an engineered mutant Kras and heterozygous Trp53 mouse model that identifies cells undergoing Trp53 loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Genetic progression post-Trp53 LOH involves clonal deletions, then genome doubling and subsequent accumulation of subclonal gains and amplifications.
