Anatomical resectability criteria based on radiologic findings for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma has been the main or even the only criterion in practice for a long time. The anatomical criteria has played a very positive role in standardizing surgical indication and restricting medical behavior. However,in the current era of systematic treatment,the limitations of anatomical criteria are becoming increasingly prominent. Although the biological criteria which can be used to evaluate the resectability of pancreatic cancer is still very limited,the comprehensive benefit of CA19-9,PET-CT,neoadjuvant therapy,gene detection and so on can still provide a reference for the evaluation of the resectability of pancreatic cancer. At present,the evaluation of resectability of pancreatic cancer should still adhere to the basic principle of taking anatomical criteria as the basis,biological criteria as the guide,and improving the prognosis of patients as the goal.
