Background:Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal malignancy with few therapeutic options available. Despite immunotherapy has revolutionised cancer treatment, the results obtained in PDAC are still disappointing. Emerging evidence suggests that chemokines/CXCRs-axis plays a pivotal role in immune tumour microenvironment modulation, which may influence immunotherapy responsiveness. Here, we evaluated the effectiveness of CXCR1/2 inhibitor ladarixin, alone or in combination with anti-PD-1, against immunosuppression in PDAC.Methods:A set of preclinical models was obtained by engrafting mouse PDAC-derived cells into syngeneic immune-competent mice, as well as by orthotopically transplanting patient-derived PDAC tumour into human immune-system-reconstituted (HIR) mice (HuCD34-NSG-mice). Tumour-bearing mice were randomly assigned to receive vehicles, ladarixin, anti-PD-1 or drugs combination.Results:CXCR1/2 inhibition by ladarixin reverted in vitro tumour-mediated M2 macrophages polarisation and migration. Ladarixin as single agent reduced tumour burden in cancer-derived graft (CDG) models with high-immunogenic potential and increased the efficacy of ICI in non-immunogenic CDG-resistant models. In a HIR mouse model bearing the immunogenic subtype of human PDAC, ladarixin showed high efficacy increasing the antitumor effect of anti-PD-1.Conclusion:Ladarixin in combination with anti-PD-1 might represent an extremely effective approach for the treatment of immunotherapy refractory PDAC, allowing pro-tumoral to immune-permissive microenvironment conversion.
