BACKGROUND: The optimal resection for pancreatic neck cancer is challenging in 
clinical practice because we could dissect by pancreaticoduodenectomy or distal 
pancreatectomy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of 
lymph node dissection and to help determine the optimal surgical treatment for 
pancreatic neck cancer.
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 462 patients with pancreatic cancer who 
underwent curative-intent pancreatectomy between 2012 and 2022, 35 of whom had 
pancreatic neck cancer without preoperative radiologic gastroduodenal artery 
contact. We analyzed the clinicopathological characteristics, lymph node 
metastasis stations, and the efficacy index of lymph node dissection, which was 
calculated by multiplying the frequency of lymph node metastasis to each station 
by the 5-year survival rate of patients with positive lymph nodes at each 
station.
RESULTS: The lymph node station with the greatest rate of metastasis was #11p 
(28.6%), followed by #8 (17.1%), #14 (14.3%), #13 (14.3%), #17 (9.5%), and #6 
(4.8%). The efficacy indices of lymph node dissection were 14.3 for #11, 4.76 
for #13, and 8.57 for #14. There were no significant differences in 5-year 
recurrence-free survival and 5-year overall survival between patients undergoing 
pancreaticoduodenectomy and those undergoing distal pancreatectomy (23.7% vs 
54.7%, P = .142; 29.9% vs 51.1%, P = .179, respectively). Univariate survival 
analysis showed that tumor size ≥2 cm was associated with poor prognosis (hazard 
ratio, 3.842, P = .009).
CONCLUSIONS: PD with #11p lymph node dissection is preferable to DP in terms of 
survival benefit for pancreatic neck cancer with lymph node metastasis.
