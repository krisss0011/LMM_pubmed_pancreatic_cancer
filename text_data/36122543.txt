Objectives:Sarcopenia has been reported as a prognostic risk factor in patients with gastrointestinal (GI) and hepatobiliary pancreatic (HBP) cancers. This study aimed to investigate whether the loss of muscle mass or strength is a stronger prognostic factor, and explore the cutoff values of skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) and handgrip strength (HGS) based on the survival outcome in patients with GI and HBP cancers.Methods:A total of 480 elderly patients with primary GI and HBP cancers who underwent their first resection surgery were analyzed retrospectively. Patients were divided into four groups: Appropriate SMI and HGS, low SMI alone, low HGS alone, and low SMI and HGS. Low SMI was derived from a bioelectrical impedance analysis, and low HGS was defined according to the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019 criteria.Results:The multivariate analysis showed that low SMI was a significant risk factor for mortality in men only, but low HGS was significant in both sexes. From the multivariate analysis of the four groups, low HGS alone and low SMI and HGS showed a significantly higher hazard ratio than appropriate SMI and HGS in both sexes. An SMI of 7.21 kg/m2and HGS of 28 kg were obtained as cutoff values based on the 3-y survival outcomes in men.Conclusions:Low muscle strength was a stronger prognostic factor than low muscle mass. Therefore, measuring muscle strength in all patients is essential.
