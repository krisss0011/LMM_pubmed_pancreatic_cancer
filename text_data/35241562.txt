Background/aim:Locally advanced pancreatic cancer has been considered for a long period of time as an unresectable lesion and therefore, all patients have been traditionally addressed to the oncological services for palliative purposes. However, due to the wide usage of newer oncological agents in association with improved surgical techniques, radical surgical procedures became feasible. The aim of this study was to present the different surgical procedures that were performed in locally advanced pancreatic cancer patients in order to achieve radical resections.Patients and methods:Between 2019 and 2020, six cases were submitted to pancreatic and vascular resections in Fundeni Clinical Hospital.Results:In all cases, surgery with curative intent was attempted; portal vein resection was performed in five cases, whereas arterial resection was performed in three cases. Reconstruction was performed by direct re-anastomosis, by placing cadaveric or synthetic grafts. The postoperative outcomes were favourable in all cases.Conclusion:Vascular resections can be safely associated with pancreatic resections in cases presenting locally advanced pancreatic lesions, with acceptable morbidity rates.
