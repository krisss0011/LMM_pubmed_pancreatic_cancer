Pancreatic cancer is highly lethal due to its aggressive invasive properties and capacity for metastatic dissemination. Additional therapeutic targets and effective treatment options for patients with tumours of high invasive capacity are required. Ras-related protein-2a (RAP2) is a member of the GTP-binding proteins. RAP2 has been reported to be widely upregulated in many types of cancers via regulating cytoskeleton reorganization, cell proliferation, migration, and adhesion, as well as inflammation. As a member of the RAS oncogene family, which has been demonstrated to drive pancreatic cancer oncogenesis and many other malignancies, the physiological roles of RAP2 in pancreatic cancer have seldom been discussed. In the present study, we explored the correlation between RAP2 expression and the prediction of overall survival of pancreatic cancer patients. Mechanistic studies were carried out to shed light on the role of RAP2 in pancreatic cancer invasion and how RAP2 is regulated in the invasive process. Our results demonstrated that patients with higher RAP2 expression showed unfavourable prognoses. studies demonstrated that silencing of inhibited the invasion of pancreatic cancer cells. Moreover, our results demonstrated that transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), an inducer of the metastatic potential of pancreatic cancer cells, regulates the expression of RAP2 via the transcription factor c-Myc. In conclusion, the present study uncovered RAP2 as a novel predictive marker and therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer.
