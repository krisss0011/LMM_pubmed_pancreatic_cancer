Background:Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly fatal malignancy and lacks effective therapeutic targets. Trametinib is considered to be a promising potential indirectly targeted KRAS inhibitor in PDAC. However, the clinical outcomes were poor. JQ1 displayed a significant synergistic effect when combined with chemotherapy or potential targeted therapy in pancreatic cancer. The impact of Trametinib and JQ1 combination treatment in PDAC remains to be fully elucidated.Methods:The efficacy of trametinib and JQ1 on cell proliferation and cytotoxicity was assayed in 7KRASmutant pancreatic cancer cell lines. The cytotoxic effects of drugs either alone or in combination were evaluated using a luminescent cell viability assay. Immunoblot analysis was carried out to investigate changes in p62 and autophagy.Results:We found that either trametinib or JQ1 alone inhibited the proliferation of some pancreatic cancer cell lines withKRASalterations, irrespective of the mutational loci ofKRASand the aberrant status of the other driver genes. The synergistic effects of combination treatment of trametinib and JQ1 were observed in both trametinib-resistant and trametinib-sensitive cells. In trametinib-sensitive PDAC cells, the combined treatment definitely inhibited p62 expression compared with trametinib alone, while LC3 expression at high levels changed little. In trametinib-resistant PDAC cells, the combination of MEK/BET inhibitor dramatically decreased p62 expression compared with single agent, while p62 expression increased after anti-autophagic therapy was added.Conclusions:Blocking RAS downstream signaling and epigenetic pathway synergistically increases the antiproliferative activity inKRASmutant PDAC cells. Combination therapeutic synergism may induce different cell death modes in different pancreatic cancer subtypes.
