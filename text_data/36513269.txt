Aims:We aimed to investigate how much cumulative hyperglycemia exposure increases pancreatic cancer risk.Methods:This study used the National Health Insurance Service Database of Claims and included 3,138,099 individuals who underwent four consecutive annual health screenings between 2009 and 2013. We defined hyperglycemic burden in two ways. First, the hyperglycemic burden was given a score from 0 to 4, with one point assigned for each time blood glucose was ≥100 mg/dL or the use of an antidiabetic drug. Furthermore, we performed semiquantitative scoring of a pre-diabetic (100-125; 1 point) and diabetic level (≥126; 2 points) and categorized into one of nine groups (hyperglycemic score 0-8).Results:During the median 6.2 years of follow-up, groups with a hyperglycemic burden of 1, 2, 3, and 4 had a 15%, 30%, 26%, and 67% increased pancreatic cancer risk compared with normal subjects. In semiquantitative analyses, individuals with a pre-diabetic glucose level on at least one occasion had a 14% increased the risk. Furthermore, individuals with a burden score of 8 had an 89% higher risk than subjects with a normal range.Conclusions:The pancreatic cancer incidence increased significantly according to the hyperglycemic burden, defined as sustained hyperglycemic exposure, including pre-diabetic levels.
