Approaches to improve pancreatic cancer therapy are essential as this disease has a very bleak outcome. Approximately 80% of pancreatic cancers are pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC). PDAC is a cancer which is difficult to effectively treat as it is often detected late in the disease process. Almost all PDACs (over 90%) have activating mutations in the GTPase gene KRAS. These mutations result in constitutive KRas activation and the mobilization of downstream pathways such as the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. Small molecule inhibitors of key components of the KRas/Raf/MEK/ERK pathways as well as monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) specific for upstream growth factor receptors such insulin like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1-R) and epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) have been developed and have been evaluated in clinical trials. An additional key regulatory gene frequently mutated (âˆ¼75%) in PDAC is the TP53 tumor suppressor gene which controls the transcription of multiple genes involved in cell cycle progression, apoptosis, metabolism, cancer progression and other growth regulatory processes. Small molecule mutant TP53 reactivators have been developed which alter the structure of mutant TP53 protein and restore some of its antiproliferative activities. Some mutant TP53 reactivators have been examined in clinical trials with patients with mutant TP53 genes. Inhibitors to the TP53 negative regulator Mouse Double Minute 2 (MDM2) have been developed and analyzed in clinical trials. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are established anti-malarial and anti-inflammatory drugs that also prevent the induction of autophagy which can have effects on cancer survival. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have also been examined in various clinical trials. Recent studies are suggesting effective treatment of PDAC patients may require chemotherapy as well as targeting multiple pathways and biochemical processes.
