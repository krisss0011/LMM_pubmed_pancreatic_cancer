Background:Pancreatic cancer is the second most frequent cause of death among all forms of cancer in Germany with more than 19,000 deaths per year. The evaluation of the nationwide clinical cancer register aims to depict the reality of treatment and to improve the quality of treatment in the future by targeted analyses.Method:The data from the clinical cancer register of Brandenburg-Berlin for the diagnosis years 2001-2017 were analyzed with respect to the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Data from patients resident in the State of Brandenburg were evaluated with respect to epidemiological and therapeutic parameters.Results:A total of 5418 patients with pancreatic cancer were documented in the register from 2001 to 2017 and 49.6% of the patients were diagnosed as having the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) stage IV. A pancreas resection was carried out in 26.4% of the cases. In cases of cancer of the head of the pancreas the most frequent procedure was a pylorus-preserving resection with 51.8% and a pancreatectomy was carried out in 9.4%. The R0 resection rate of all pancreatic cancers in the period from 2014 to 2017 was 61.9%. After R0 resection the 5â€‘year survival was 19%. Relevant multivariate survival factors were age, UICC stage and the residual (R) tumor classification. The case numbers per hospital had no influence on the absolute survival of patients operated on in the State of Brandenburg.Conclusion:The treatment reality in the State of Brandenburg for patients with pancreatic cancer corresponds to the results of international publications with respect to the key performance indicators investigated. A qualitative internationally comparable treatment of these patients is also possible in nonmetropolitan regions.
