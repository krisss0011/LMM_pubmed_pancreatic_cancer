Objective:We aim to provide a thorough review of the literature regarding patient characteristics, treatment options, and outcomes of pancreatic cancer metastasis to the spine. We also provide an illustrative case from our institution of a patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma presenting initially as cervical radiculopathy with an isolated cervical spine lesion.Methods:Using the PRISMA guidelines, the literature in PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science databases was searched. We excluded systematic reviews and meta-analyses that did not provide novel cases, as well as reports of metastatic disease from other nonpancreatic primary cancers.Results:Thirty-two patients across 21 studies met the inclusion criteria. The patients were predominantly male (58%), with a mean age of 59 years. Of patients, 64% presented with back pain, 39% with motor deficits, and 15% with bladder or bowel dysfunction. For treatment, chemotherapy was used in 55% of cases and radiotherapy in 42%. Surgical treatment was performed in 42% of cases, with complete tumor resection achieved in 24% of cases. The mean patient survival after treatment was 28 weeks (range, 1-83 weeks), with patients undergoing treatment involving surgery having increased survival (44 weeks) compared with noninvasive treatment alone (18 weeks).Conclusions:Spinal metastasis of pancreatic cancer is rare and typically portends a poor prognosis. It is vital to recognize the presence of spinal involvement early in the disease course and initiate treatment.
