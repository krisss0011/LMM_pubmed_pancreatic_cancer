Background:It is unclear whether invasive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) has different clinical and prognostic characteristics, beyond histological factors, when compared to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).Aims:compare prognostic features of resected PDAC and invasive IPMN METHODS: A retrospective study of patients resected for PDAC or invasive IPMN realized at Humanitas Cancer Center's Pancreatic Surgery Unit, Milan, Italy, between 2010 and 2016. Data recorded included patient demographics, onset symptoms, preoperative health status, tumor features, histology and surgical characteristics. Overall survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier and prognostic factors for survival were assessed by multivariate Cox regression.Results:A total of 332 patients were included (PDAC, n = 289; invasive IPMN, n = 43). Patients with invasive IPMN had better overall survival than PDAC patients (median: 76.6 versus 25.6 months; 5-year OS rate: 65.4% vs. 14.2%; p < 0.001). PDAC histology was associated with a significantly higher risk of death than IPMN (hazard ratio 1.815, 95% CI: 1.02, 3.24; p = 0.044). Survival was also worse with PDAC in early-stage disease (IA-IB-IIA, N0). In multivariate analysis, independent predictors of worse survival included perineural invasion, preoperative ASA physical status â‰¥3 and pain at diagnosis.Conclusions:Patients with IPMN had a better prognosis than PDAC patients, regardless of disease stage.
