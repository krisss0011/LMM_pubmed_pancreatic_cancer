Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is lethal. There is a dire need for better therapeutic targets. Cancer cells have increased demand for sugars, amino acids, and lipids and therefore up-regulate various nutrient transporters to meet this demand. In PDAC, SLC6A14 (an amino acid transporter (AAT)) is up-regulated, affecting overall patient survival. Previously we have shown using in vitro cell culture models and in vivo xenograft mouse models that pharmacological inhibition of SLC6A14 with α-methyl-l-tryptophan (α-MLT) attenuates PDAC growth. Mechanistically, blockade of SLC6A14-mediated amino acid transport with α-MLT leads to amino acid deprivation, eventually inhibiting mTORC1 signaling pathway, in tumor cells. Here, we report on the effect of Slc6a14 deletion on various parameters of PDAC in KPC mice, a model for spontaneous PDAC. Pancreatic tumors in KPC mice show evidence of Slc6a14 up-regulation. Deletion of Slc6a14 in this mouse attenuates PDAC growth, decreases the metastatic spread of the tumor, reduces ascites fluid accumulation, and improves overall survival. At the molecular level, we show lower proliferation index and reduced desmoplastic reaction following Slc6a14 deletion. Furthermore, we find that deletion of Slc6a14 does not lead to compensatory up-regulation in any of the other amino transporters. In fact, some of the AATs are actually down-regulated in response to Slc6a14 deletion, most likely related to altered mTORC1 signaling. Taken together, these results underscore the positive role SLC6A14 plays in PDAC growth and metastasis. Therefore, SLC6A14 is a viable drug target for the treatment of PDAC and also for any other cancer that overexpresses this transporter.
