Radiomics is a newer approach for analyzing radiological images obtained from conventional imaging modalities such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, endoscopic ultrasonography, and positron emission tomography. Radiomics involves extracting quantitative data from the images and assessing them to identify diagnostic or prognostic features such as tumor grade, resectability, tumor response to neoadjuvant therapy, and survival. The purpose of this review is to discuss the basic principles of radiomics and provide an overview of the current clinical applications of radiomics in the field of pancreatic tumors.
