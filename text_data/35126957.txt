Perineural invasion (PNI) is a typical feature of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which occurs in most cases. The embryonic protein Nodal plays a critical role in embryonic neural development and is overexpressed in human pancreatic cancer. In this study, we explored the contribution of Nodal to pancreatic cancer PNI and progression. We evaluated the function of Nodal in PNI by coculturing rat dorsal root ganglia and pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and performing cellular and molecular biology assays. The results illustrate that Nodal upregulates NGF (nerve growth factor), BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), and GDNF (glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor) expression in pancreatic cancer cells and promotes cancer cell migration/invasion. Furthermore, in the in vitro 3D PNI model, Nodal enhances nerve outgrowth to pancreatic cancer cell colonies. Our study indicates that Nodal participates in tumor invasion by mediating neural and tumor cell signaling interactions, and inhibiting the expression of Nodal represents a potential strategy for targeting PNI in pancreatic cancer therapy.
