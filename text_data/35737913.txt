Purpose:Genetic alterations in many components of the homologous recombination, DNA damage response, and repair (HR-DDR) pathway are involved in the hereditary cancer syndromes, including familial pancreatic cancer. HR-DDR genes beyondBRCA1,BRCA2,ATM, andPALB2may also mutate and confer the HR-DDR deficiency in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).Methods:We conducted a study to examine the genetic alterations using a companion diagnostic 15-gene HR-DDR panel in PDACs. HR-DDR gene mutations were identified and characterized by whole-exome sequencing and whole-genome sequencing. Different HR-DDR gene mutations are associated with variable homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) scores.Results:Eight of 50 PDACs with at least one HR-DDR gene mutation were identified. One tumor withBRCA2mutations is associated with a high HRD score. However, another tumor with aCHEK2mutation is associated with a zero HRD score. Notably, four of eight PDACs in this study harbor aRAD51Bgene mutation. All fourRAD51Bgene mutations were germline mutations. However, currently,RAD51Bis not the gene panel for germline tests.Conclusion:The finding in this study thus supports includingRAD51Bin the germline test of HR-DDR pathway genes.
