Gastrointestinal pancreas (GEP) is the most common site of neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs). In 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) classification for GEP NET was updated to include a new category of well-differentiated high-grade (Ki 67>20%) GEP-NET G3, distinct from high-grade poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC). As a new category, NET G3 are considered a molecularly, radiologically, and prognostically distinct entity compared to NEC and NET G1/G2. The management of NET G3 remains a challenge awaiting future trials taking into consideration the unique characteristics of this new category. The latest NCCN clinical guidelines of neuroendocrine and adrenal tumors firstly gave the recommendation of diagnosis and treatment of G3 NET separately from NEC and G1/G2 NET. Hereon,we aim to summarize the management of G3 NET in combination with the new NCCN guidelines and the current evidences.
