Targeting oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes is an emerging strategy to disrupt the metabolism of select cancer subtypes and to overcome resistance to targeted therapies. Here, we describe our lead optimization campaign on a series of benzene-1,4-disulfonamides as novel OXPHOS complex I inhibitors. This effort led to the discovery of compound23(DX3-213B) as one of the most potent complex I inhibitors reported to date.DX3-213Bdisrupts adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation, inhibits complex I function, and results in the growth inhibition of pancreatic cancer cells in the low nanomolar range. Importantly, the oral administration ofDX3-213Bresulted in significantin vivoefficacy in a pancreatic cancer syngeneic model without obvious toxicity. Our data clearly demonstrate that OXPHOS inhibition can be a safe and efficacious strategy to treat pancreatic cancer.
