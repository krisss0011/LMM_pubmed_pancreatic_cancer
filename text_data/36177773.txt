Purpose:To investigate the impact of race/ethnicity on surgical outcomes following pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer.Methods:A retrospective review of patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy for adenocarcinoma in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database from 2014 to 2019. Patient and tumor characteristics and 30-day postoperative outcomes were compared. Multivariable logistic and linear regression models were conducted to investigate the relationship between race/ethnicity and surgical outcomes.Results:Six thousand five hundred and sixty-two patients were included (84.5% White, 7.9% Black, 3% Hispanic, 4.6% Asian). Larger proportions of Blacks had preoperative American Society of Anesthesiologists class 3 or 4. There were no significant differences in tumor characteristics or operative techniques. A smaller proportion of Asians and Hispanics received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation than Blacks and Whites. Relative to White, the Black race was independently associated with postoperative sepsis and reoperation. Both Black and Hispanic race/ethnicity were associated with prolonged intubation and delayed gastric emptying, and minorities races/ethnicities were associated with longer length of hospital stay. Relative to White, Hispanic, and Asian race/ethnicity were independently associated with a lower likelihood of neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) receipt.Conclusion:In ACS-NSQIP participating hospitals, non-White race/ethnicity was independently associated with adverse outcomes after pancreatic cancer resection. A possible disparity in NAT receipt may exist in Asian and Hispanic patients undergoing surgical resection.
