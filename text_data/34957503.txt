The 5-year overall survival (OS) of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is only 10%, partly owing to the lack of reliable diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. The raw gene-cell matrix for single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analysis was downloaded from the GSA database. We drew cell atlas for PDAC and normal pancreatic tissues. The inferCNV analysis was used to distinguish tumor cells from normal ductal cells. We identified differential expression genes (DEGs) by comparing tumor cells and normal ductal cells. The common DEGs were used to conduct prognostic and diagnostic model using univariate and multivariate Cox or logistic regression analysis. Four genes, MET, KLK10, PSMB9 and ITGB6, were utilized to create risk score formula to predict OS and to establish diagnostic model for PDAC. Finally, we drew an easy-to-use nomogram to predict 2-year and 3-year OSs. In conclusion, we developed and validated the prognostic and diagnostic model for PDAC based on scRNA-seq and bulk-seq datasets.
