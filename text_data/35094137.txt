Background:Pancreatic cancer (PCa) and biliary tract carcinomas (BTCa) have high morbidity and mortality rates. Bile duct obstruction (BDO) develops in approximately 65-75% of PCa at diagnosis, delaying the administration of optimal treatment. In patients not candidates for surgery, BDO is usually treated through the endoscopy-guided placement of self-expanding stents in the bile duct.Methods:In this retrospective study, we sought to describe clinical characteristics and outcomes of a cohort of patients with BDO of malignant origin who underwent biliary stent placement (BSP), with a special focus regarding complications developed after the procedure. Patients with PCa, BTCa, colon cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer, and ovarian cancer who underwent BSP from 2014 to April 2019 at our institution were included in this cohort. Demographic and clinicopathologic characteristics were collected. Statistical analysis stratified according to ECOG performance status. Specific information regarding stent material (metallic vs. plastic), as well as incidence and type of complications derived from BSP, was also recorded.Results:One hundred fifteen patients were included. The median age was 72 years. Sixty-six patients (57%) had PCa. All patients presented hyperbilirubinemia, which decreased after the procedure in 111 (96%) patients. Complications were observed in 44 (38%) patients, most of which 33 (75%) were infections. The median time to the complication was 1 month. The mean overall survival (OS) in our study was 20.3 weeks.Conclusion:BSP effectively decreased hyperbilirubinemia in patients with BDO; however, the procedure associated a significant rate of infectious complications, which can further compromise an effective anti-cancer therapy as well as optimal palliative strategies.
