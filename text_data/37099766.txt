Objectives:The aims of this review were to determine whether positive peritoneal lavage cytology (CY+) precludes radical resection in pancreatic cancer and to propose prospections for future studies.Methods:MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central were searched for related articles. Dichotomous variables and survival outcomes were analyzed with the estimation of odds ratio and hazards ratio (HR), respectively.Results:A total of 4905 patients were included, of which 7.8% were CY+. Positive peritoneal lavage cytology was correlated with poor overall survival (univariate survival analysis [HR, 2.35; P < 0.00001]; multivariate analysis [HR, 1.62; P < 0.00001]), poor recurrence-free survival (univariate survival analysis [HR, 2.50; P < 0.00001]; multivariate analysis [HR, 1.84; P < 0.00001]), and higher initial peritoneal recurrence rate (odds ratio, 5.49; P < 0.00001).Conclusions:Although CY+ predicts poor prognosis and a higher risk of peritoneal metastasis after curative resection, it is not sufficient to preclude curative resection based on the current evidence, and high-quality trials should be conducted to assess the prognostic impact of operation among resectable CY+ patients. In addition, more sensitive and accurate methods to detect peritoneal exfoliated tumor cells and more effective comprehensive treatment for resectable CY+ pancreatic cancer patients are clearly warranted.
