The histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor vorinostat, used with gemcitabine and other therapies, has been effective in treatment of experimental models of pancreatic cancer. In this study, we demonstrated that M344, an HDAC inhibitor, is efficacious against pancreatic cancer in vitro and in vivo, alone or with gemcitabine. By 24 hours post-treatment, M344 augments the population of pancreatic cancer cells in G1, and at a later time point (48 hours) it increases apoptosis. M344 inhibits histone H3 deacetylation and slows pancreatic cancer cell proliferation better than vorinostat, and it does not decrease the viability of a non-malignant cell line more than vorinostat. M344 also elevates pancreatic cancer cell major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule expression, potentially increasing the susceptibility of pancreatic cancer cells to T cell lysis. Taken together, our findings support further investigation of M344 as a pancreatic cancer treatment.
