MicroRNA (miRNA) expression dysregulations in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have been studied widely for their diagnostic and prognostic utility. By the use of bioinformatics-based methods, in our previous study, we identified some potential miRNA panels for diagnosis of pancreatic cancer patients from noncancerous controls (the screening stage). In this report, we used 142 plasma samples from people with and without pancreatic cancer (PC) to conduct RT-qPCR differential expression analysis to assess the strength of the first previously proposed diagnostic panel (consisting of miR-125a-3p, miR-4530, and miR-92a-2-5p). As the result, we identified significant upregulation for all the three considered miRNAs in the serum of PC patients. After that, a three-miRNA panel in serum was developed. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) for the panel were 0.850, 0.910, and 0.86, respectively, indicating that it had a higher diagnostic value than individual miRNAs. Therefore, we detected a promising three-miRNA panel in the plasma for noninvasive PC diagnosis (miR-125a-3p, miR-4530, and miR-92a-2-5p).
