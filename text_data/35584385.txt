Objectives:Indications of preoperative treatment for resectable (R-) or borderline resectable (BR-) pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are unclear, and the protocol remains to be standardized.Methods:Included 65 patients with R- and BR-PDAC with venous involvement (V-) received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with S-1 and 50 Gy of radiation as the 5-week regimen. The outcomes of this group were compared with those of 52 patients who underwent S-1 and 30 Gy of radiation as the 2-week regimen, previously collected as our prospective phase II study.Results:Compared with the 2-week regimen, there were no significant differences in the rate of protocol completion, adverse events, mortality and morbidity, or R0 resection in the 5-week regimen. In subgroup analyses of R-PDAC, there were no significant differences in overall survival and recurrence-free survival between the groups. In contrast, the 5-week regimen had significantly better overall survival and recurrence-free survival than the 2-week regimen for BRV-PDAC. Similar results were observed after propensity score matching analysis.Conclusions:The 5-week regimen of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has good clinical efficacy and safety for R- and BRV-PDAC. The 5-week regimen could achieve better outcomes than the 2-week regimen for BRV-PDAC. In contrast, both regimens achieved similar outcomes for R-PDAC.
