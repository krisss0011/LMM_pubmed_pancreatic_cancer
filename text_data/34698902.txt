Purpose:Docosahexaenoyl difluorodeoxycytidine (DHA-dFdC) is an amide with potent, broad-spectrum antitumor activity. In the present study, DHA-dFdC's ability to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) was tested using CT26 mouse colorectal cancer cells, an established cell line commonly used for identifying ICD inducers, as well as Panc-02 mouse pancreatic cancer cells.Methods:The three primary surrogate markers of ICD (i.e., calreticulin (CRT) surface translocation, ATP release, and high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) release) were measured in vitro. To confirm DHA-dFdC's ability to induce ICD in vivo, the gold standard mouse vaccination studies were conducted using both CT26 and Panc-02 models. Additionally, the effect of DHA-dFdC on tumor response to anti-programmed cell death protein 1 monoclonal antibody (anti-PD-1 mAb) were tested in mice with pre-established Panc-02 tumors. RNA sequencing experiments were conducted on PANC-1 human pancreatic cancer cells treated with DHA-dFdC, dFdC, or vehicle control in vitro.Results:DHA-dFdC elicited CRT surface translocation and ATP and HMGB1 release in both cell lines. Immunization of mice with CT26 or Panc-02 cells pretreated with DHA-dFdC prevented or delayed the development of corresponding secondary live challenge tumor. DHA-dFdC enabled Panc-02 tumors to respond to anti-PD-1 mAb. RNA sequencing experiments revealed that DHA-dFdC and dFdC differentially impacted genes related to the KRAS, TP53, and inflammatory pathways, and DHA-dFdC enriched for the unfolded protein response (UPR) compared to control, providing insight into DHA-dFdC's potential mechanism of inducing ICD.Conclusion:DHA-dFdC is a bona fide ICD inducer and can render pancreatic tumors responsive to anti-PD-1 mAb therapy.
