Background:Pancreatic cancer does not show any symptoms in the early period and metastatic process is already passed when the diagnosis is done. Therefore, in the battle with pancreatic cancer, novel treatment strategies, particularly antiinvasive and antimetastatic strategies, are needed. The cytotoxic and anticancer effects of juglone and sodium selenite (NaSe) have been showed in various cancer cells.Objectives:In this study, it is aimed to investigate the synergistic effects of juglone and selenium on PANC-1 and BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cells.Methods:Antimetastatic effects of juglone-NaSe were carried out by adhesion and invasion assays and the genes and protein expressions. Expression analysis of the CDH1, ITGB3 and COL4A3 genes and their proteins E-cadherin, Î²3 integrin and tumstatin which play role in metastasis and angiogenesis processes, were done by qPCR and immunohistochemical analysis, respectively.Results:Study findings have provided evidences that the juglone-selenium has a cytotoxic and dose dependent suppressive effect on invasion and metastasis in PANC-1 and BxPC-3 cells.Conclusion:The juglone-NaSe has the potential to be a promising agent especially to inhibit invasion and metastasis in pancreatic cancer treatment. However, more in depth studies are needed to more clearly demonstrate the effects of juglone-selenium.
