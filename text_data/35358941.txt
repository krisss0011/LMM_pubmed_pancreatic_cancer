Among all the cancer-related deaths globally, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) accounts for the seventh leading cause of mortality. A dysregulated immune system disrupts anti-tumor immunity by abnormal accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), but the underlying mechanisms are still inconclusive. To gain new insights into the role of MDSCs in tumor settings, we aimed to determine the mechanism of expansion of various subsets of MDSCs in PDAC patients and their role in promoting invasiveness. We assessed the load of MDSCs, chemokines responsible for the recruitment of MDSCs in PDAC patients by flow cytometry. We investigated the chemokine profile of tumor tissue using qRT-PCR and the status of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) related markers E-Cadherin, N-Cadherin, Snail, and ZEB1 by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. We found a higher frequency of tumor infiltrated MDSCs in PDAC patients. Chemokine ligands CCL2 and the receptor CCR4 were markedly elevated in the PDAC tumor, while CCR4+monocytic MDSCs (M-MDSCs) were found significantly elevated in peripheral blood and tumor tissue. In tumor tissue, expression of E-Cadherin was significantly reduced, while N-Cadherin, Snail, and ZEB1 were markedly raised. The frequency of CCR4+M-MDSCs significantly correlated with the expression of mesenchymal transition markers N-Cadherin, Snail, and ZEB1. Collectively, these results suggest that the CCL2-CCR4 axis plays a crucial role in driving the recruitment of M-MDSCs, which is associated with increased invasiveness in PDAC. This study sheds light on the expansion mechanism of MDSCs, which can serve as a crucial target of future anti-cancer strategies to inhibit tumor cell invasiveness.
