Ethnopharmacological relevance:Tripterygium hypoglaucum (Kunmingshanhaitang in Chinese) is a plant of the genus Tripterygium which have been used as anti-tumor folk medicines in Yi and Bai ethnic groups in Yunnan province, China for hundreds of years. Terpenoids from T. hypoglaucum presented therapeutic effects on multiple tumors. But there were few studies about pancreatic cancer treatment of these terpenoids. Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive malignancy and lacked of specific drugs. Currently, anti-tumor drugs have poor therapeutic effect and prognosis for pancreatic cancer.Aim of the study:This study aimed to elucidate the terpenoids from T. hypoglaucum and illuminate their anti-pancreatic cancer bioactivities.Material and methods:Terpenoids were obtained through sequential chromatographic methods including silica gel, MCI gel, Sephadex LH-20, and preparative HPLC. Their structures were determined by HRESIMS, 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic analysis. The absolute configurations of some new diterpenoids were assigned through comparison of experimental and calculated circular dichroism spectra. The cytotoxicity of isolates was measured using the MTT method on human pancreatic cancer cells SW1990. The effects on expressions of AKT, Erk1/2, p-AKT, p-Erk1/2, and Bax proteins in human pancreatic cancer cells SW1990 of these compounds were determined by western blotting assays.Results:Eleven new (compounds 1∼11) and fourteen known terpenoids (compounds 12∼25) were isolated from the underground parts of T. hypoglaucum. These compounds were belonged to abietane diterpenoids, isoprimara diterpenoids, ent-kaurane diterpenoids, oleanane triterpenoids, and friedelane triterpenoids. Compounds 5, 7, 8, 9, 16, 18, 22, 24, and 25 possessed significant cytotoxicity against SW1990 cells with IC50values of 19.28 ± 4.39, 9.91 ± 2.23, 27.32 ± 5.89, 56.43 ± 6.92, 0.16 ± 0.05, 0.58 ± 0.15, 0.81 ± 0.04, 0.48 ± 0.11, and 10.01 ± 1.39 μM respectively. After compounds 16, 22, and 24 been treated with the pancreatic cancer cells in medium and high doses, the protein expressions of AKT, p-AKT, Erk, and p-Erk were not remarkably reduced and the expressions of Bax protein were significantly increased.Conclusion:This study indicated that terpenoids from T. hypoglaucum could inhibit human pancreatic cancer cells SW1990. Especially, compounds 16, 22, and 24 possessed significant cytotoxicity against SW1990 cells with low IC50values and could increase the expressions of Bax protein. These compounds shared a wide variety of structural characteristics which provided us more candidate molecules for the development of anti-pancreatic cancer drugs and further prompted us to investigate their anti-pancreatic mechanisms.
