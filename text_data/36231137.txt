Background:KRASG12D mutation subtype is present in over 40% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), one of the leading global causes of cancer death. This retrospective cohort study aims to investigate whether detection of theKRASG12D mutation subtype in PDAC patients is a determinant of prognosis across all stages of disease.Methods: We reviewed the medical records of 231 patients presenting with PDAC at a large tertiary hospital, and compared survival using the Kaplan Meier, log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards regression model.Results:KRASG12D mutation subtype was not significantly associated with poorer survival compared across the whole population of PDAC patients (p= 0.107; HR 1.293 95% CI (0.946-1.767)). However,KRASG12D patients who were resectable had a shorter median survival time of 356 days compared to all other genotypes (median survival 810 days) (p= 0.019; HR 1.991 95% CI (1.121-3.537)).Conclusions:KRASG12D patients who were resectable at diagnosis had shorter survival compared to all other PDAC patients. These data suggest thatKRASG12D may be a clinically useful prognostic biomarker of PDAC.
