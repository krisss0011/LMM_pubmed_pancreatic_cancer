Purpose:This review summarizes and synthesizes the available empirical literature on the experiences concerned with the problems and challenges faced by caregivers of patients with pancreatic cancer.Methods:An integrative review method was used, and a literature search was conducted using five databases. We searched the terms "pancreatic cancer," "caregiver," and "experience," and used the Boolean operators OR and AND to combine them. The Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools were used to assess the quality of the included studies.Results:Four qualitative studies, one mixed method, and three quantitative studies met the selection criteria and were included in the review. Informal family caregivers of patients with pancreatic cancer experienced multifaceted roles, lack of information, difficulties in maintaining emotional well-being, and positive coping. The factors associated with their caring experience included the caregivers' demographics, patients' psychological status, and clinical characteristics.Conclusion:Caregivers of patients with pancreatic cancer have various experiences while providing care. Health care providers should offer opportunities for caregivers to recognize their feelings, provide sufficient information and psychological support, and foster coping strategies to maintain the physical and psychosocial well-being of caregivers.
