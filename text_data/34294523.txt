Background:Surgical resection is the mainstay of potential cure for patients with pancreatic cancer, however, local recurrence is frequent. Previously, we have described an extended resection technique for pancreatoduodenectomy aiming at a radical resection of the nerve and lymphatic tissue between celiac artery, superior mesenteric artery and mesenteric-portal axis (TRIANGLE operation). Until now, data on postoperative outcome have not been reported, yet.Methods:Patients who underwent either partial (PD) or total pancreatoduodenectomy (TP) applying the TRIANGLE procedure were identified. These cohorts were compared to matched historic cohorts with standard resections.Results:Overall, 330 patients were analysed (PDTRIANGLEand PDSTANDARD,each n = 108; TPTRIANGLEand TPSTANDARD,each n = 57). More lymph nodes were harvested in TRIANGLE compared to standard resection (PD: 27.5 (21-35) versus 31.5 (24-40); P = 0.0187, TP: 33 (28-49) versus 44 (29-53); P = 0.3174) and the rate of tumour positive resections margins, R1(direct), dropped. Duration of operation was significantly longer and blood loss higher. Postoperative mortality and complications did not differ significantly.Conclusion:Pancreatoduodenectomy according to the TRIANGLE protocol can be performed without increased morbidity and mortality at a high-volume centre. Long-term survival and quality of life need to be investigated in prospective clinical trials with adequate sample size.
