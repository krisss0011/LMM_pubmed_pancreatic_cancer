Radiation therapy offers limited clinical benefits for patients with pancreatic cancer, partly as a result of the predominantly immunosuppressive microenvironment characteristic of this specific type of cancer. A large number of abnormal blood vessels and high-density fibrous matrices in pancreatic cancer will lead to hypoxia within tumor tissue and hinder immune cell infiltration. We used low-dose X-ray irradiation, also known as low-dose radiation therapy (LDRT), to normalize the blood vessels in pancreatic cancer, while simultaneously administering an inhibitor of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) to reduce pancreatic cancer fibrosis. We found that this treatment successfully reduced pancreatic cancer hypoxia, increased immune cell infiltration, and increased sensitivity to radiation therapy for pancreatic cancer.
