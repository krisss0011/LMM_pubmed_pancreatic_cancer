Tissue factor-procoagulant activity (TF-PCA) on cells is modified by multiple molecular mechanisms of encryption and decryption. The risk of thrombosis is higher for patients with a high tissue factor antigen level at registration as this enables patient's blood more PCA-high status before the onset of cancer-associated thromboembolism (CAT). ELISA, including the Quantikine assay with validation as performed in our study, can contribute to more precise prediction of CAT.
