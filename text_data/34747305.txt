Introduction:'Brittle Diabetes' (BD) is a life-threatening metabolic complication after total pancreatectomy (TP). More than 500 Intraportal islet autotransplantation (IAT) have been performed to prevent this complication, with almost 70% insulin independence after 3 years. Even when insulin independence was not achieved, IAT successfully prevented severe hypoglycemia. Currently, preliminary results for oncologic situations are promising, but their oncological outcomes are still a matter of debate.Areas covered:We performed a bibliographic research of the last 25 years of data. Articles published in English in peer-reviewed journals were retained. In France, auto- and allo-islet transplantation was recently recognized as a valuable treatment for BD by the national health authority. While accepted for benign diseases, the risk of tumor spreading after IAT in oncologic situations is a source of concern.Expert opinion:Preliminary results of IAT in oncological situations are very encouraging. So far, there is no evidence of tumor dissemination. In our opinion, to overcome BD TP with IAT for resectable pancreatic malignancies in patients with a higher risk of postoperative pancreatic fistula and extended pancreatic cancers can be safely performed. Diagnosis of malignancy should not be considered as an exclusion criterion for IAT.
