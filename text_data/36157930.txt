Background:Pancreatic cancer is the most aggressive cancer type. Gemcitabine is the first line chemo-drug used for pancreatic cancer but exerts a broad spectrum of organ toxicities and adverse effects in patients.Aim:To evaluate the anti-tumour activity and toxicological effects ofOrthosiphon stamineusextract formulation (ID: C5EOSEW5050ESA trademarked as Nuva-staticTM), and gemcitabine combination on pancreatic xenograft model.Methods:Mice were randomly divided into six groups of 6 mice each (n= 6) and given different treatments for 28 d. The study design consisted of a 2 x 3 factorial treatment structure, with gemcitabine (yes/no) by oral (at 1200 and 400 mg/kg per day). Human pancreatic cancer cells were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of athymic nude mice. C5EOSEW5050ESA (200 or 400 mg/kg per day) was administered orally, while gemcitabine (10 mg/kg per 3 d) was given intraperitoneally either alone or in combination treatment. Histopathological analyses of vital organs, tumour tissues, and incidence of lethality were analysed. Analyses of tumour necrosis and proliferation were determined by haematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemistry for Ki-67, respectively.Results:No signs of toxicity or damage to vital organs were observed in all treatment groups compared to the untreated group. C5EOSEW5050ESA at 200 mg/kg and gemcitabine combination had no additive antitumor effects compared to a single treatment. Remarkably, a comparably greater response in a reduction in tumour growth, Ki-67 protein expression, and necrosis was demonstrated by 400 mg/kg of C5EOSEW5050ESA and gemcitabine combination than that of the individual agents.Conclusion:These results highlighted the synergistic activity of C5EOSEW5050ESA with gemcitabine to reduce pancreatic tumour growth in mice compared to a single treatment. Thus, this study provides valuable insights into using C5EOSEW5050ESA as a complementary treatment with gemcitabine for pancreatic cancer.
