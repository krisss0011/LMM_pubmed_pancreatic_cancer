Introduction:Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) represents a promising tool for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment monitoring of several malignancies. Its association with tumor burden in pancreatic ductal cancer (PDAC), especially in localized disease, is not fully explored yet. We aimed to investigate the association of pretherapeutic ctDNA levels in localized and metastatic PDAC with tumor volume and clinical outcomes.Material and methods:Liquid biopsy for ctDNA detection was prospectively obtained from patients with localized or disseminated PDAC prior to either resection or systemic treatment. Detection rates and levels of ctDNA (digital droplet PCR) were correlated to tumor volume, relapse rate and survival.Results:60 patients with localized and 47 patients with metastatic PDAC were included. ctDNA was detected in 10% of localized and 57.4% of metastasized PDAC samples. In localized disease, ctDNA detection significantly correlated with the numbers of involved locoregional lymph nodes (p = 0.030). Primary tumor volume did not correlate with ctDNA levels in neither localized (p = 0.573) nor metastasized disease (p = 0.878). In disseminated disease, ctDNA levels correlated with total tumor volume (p = 0.026) and especially with liver metastases volume (p = 0.004), but not with other metastases. Detection of pretherapeutic ctDNA was associated with shorter DFS in localized (3.3 vs. 18.1 months, p = 0.000), whereas ctDNA levels were associated with worse survival in metastatic PDAC (5.7 vs. 7.8 months, p = 0.036).Conclusion:ctDNA positivity indicates major nodal involvement or even presence of undetected distant metastases associated with early recurrence in localized PDAC. Moreover, it predicts worse clinical outcome in both localized and metastatic disease.
