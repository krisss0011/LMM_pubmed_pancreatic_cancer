Purpose:This study aimed to assess the impact of neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) for borderline resectable or locally advanced pancreatic cancer (BR/LAPC) on the American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) nodal status.Methods:The medical records of BR/LAPC patients who underwent surgery with curative intent were retrospectively reviewed. The nodal status was compared between patients who underwent upfront surgery (UFS) and those who received NAT. Moreover, clinicopathological factors and prognostic factors for overall survival were analyzed.Results:In all, 200 patients with BR/LAPC, 78 with UFS, and 122 with NAT were enrolled. The nodal status was significantly lower in patients after NAT than after UFS (p = 0.011). A multivariate analysis of overall survival showed that UFS (hazard ratio (HR) 1.61, p = 0.024) and N2 status (HR 2.69, p < 0.001) were independent poor prognostic factors. The median serum carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 level after NAT in N2 patients was 105 U/mL, which was significantly higher than that of patients with N0 (p = 0.004) and N1 (p = 0.008) status.Conclusion:Patients with BR/LAPC who underwent surgery after NAT had significantly lower N2 status and better prognosis than patients who underwent UFS. Elevated CA19-9 levels after NAT indicated a higher nodal status.
