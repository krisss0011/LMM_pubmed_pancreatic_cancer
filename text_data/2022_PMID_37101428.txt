We describe a small molecule ligand ACA-14 (2-hydroxy-5-{[(2-phenylcyclopropyl) 
carbonyl] amino} benzoic acid) as an initial lead for the development of direct 
inhibitors of KRAS, a notoriously difficult anticancer drug target. We show that 
the compound binds to KRAS near the switch regions with affinities in the low 
micromolar range and exerts different effects on KRAS interactions with binding 
partners. Specifically, ACA-14 impedes the interaction of KRAS with its effector 
Raf and reduces both intrinsic and SOS-mediated nucleotide exchange rates. 
Likely as a result of these effects, ACA-14 inhibits signal transduction through 
the MAPK pathway in cells expressing mutant KRAS and inhibits the growth of 
pancreatic and colon cancer cells harboring mutant KRAS. We thus propose 
compound ACA-14 as a useful initial lead for the development of broad-acting 
inhibitors that target multiple KRAS mutants and simultaneously deplete the 
fraction of GTP-loaded KRAS while abrogating the effector-binding ability of the 
already GTP-loaded fraction.
