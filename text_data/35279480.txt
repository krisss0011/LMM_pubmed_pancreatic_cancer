Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide. There are no effective early diagnosis and therapeutic methods for PC. Mounting evidence has shown that lncRNAs promote PC progression. For instance, HOXD-AS1 acts as an oncogenic lncRNA in some digestive tumors. However, its role in PC is unknown. This study aimed to investigate the role of HOXD-AS1 in PC and its underlying mechanisms. Quantitative reverse transcription (qRTâ€‘PCR) was used to measure the expression levels of HOXD-AS1, miR-664b-3p, and PLAC8. CCK-8, colony formation, wound healing, and transwell assays were used to assess the effect of HOXD-AS1 on the proliferation, invasion and migration of PC cells. Dual-luciferase reporter and cell function rescue assays were used to verify the regulation relationship of miR-664b-3p and HOXD-AS1 or PLAC8. HOXD-AS1 was significantly upregulated in PC tissues than in paired adjacent tissues. Moreover, HOXD-AS1 was related to the advanced TNM stage. Meanwhile, HOXD-AS1 promoted the proliferation, invasion, and migration of PC cells. Mechanically, HOXD-AS1 upregulated PLAC8 by targeting miR-664b-3p. In conclusion, HOXD-AS1 was upregulated in PC tissues, promoting the proliferation, invasion, and migration of PC cells via the miR-664b-3p/PLAC8 axis.
