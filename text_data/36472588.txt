Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a lethal and metastatic malignancy resistant to therapy. Elucidating how pancreatic tumor-specific T cells differentiate and are maintained in vivo could inform novel therapeutic avenues to promote T cell antitumor activity. Here, we show that the spleen is a critical site harboring tumor-specific CD8 T cells that functionally segregate based on differential Cxcr3 and Klrg1 expression. Cxcr3+ Klrg1- T cells express the memory stem cell marker Tcf1, whereas Cxcr3-Klrg1 + T cells express GzmB consistent with terminal differentiation. We identify a Cxcr3+ Klrg1+ intermediate T cell subpopulation in the spleen that is highly enriched for tumor specificity. However, tumor-specific T cells infiltrating primary tumors progressively downregulate both Cxcr3 and Klrg1 while upregulating exhaustion markers PD-1 and Lag-3. We show that antigen-specific T cell infiltration into PDA is Cxcr3 independent. Further, Cxcr3-deficiency results in enhanced antigen-specific T cell IFNÎ³ production in primary tumors, suggesting that Cxcr3 promotes loss of effector function. Ultimately, however, Cxcr3 was critical for mitigating cancer cell dissemination following immunotherapy with CD40 agonist + anti-PD-L1 or T cell receptor engineered T cell therapy targeting mesothelin. In the absence of Cxcr3, splenic Klrg1 + GzmB + antitumor T cells wain while pancreatic cancer disseminates suggesting a role for these cells in eliminating circulating metastatic tumor cells. Intratumoral myeloid cells are poised to produce Cxcl10, whereas splenic DC subsets produce Cxcl9 following immunotherapy supporting differential roles for these chemokines on T cell differentiation. Together, our study supports that Cxcr3 mitigates tumor cell dissemination by impacting peripheral T cell fate rather than intratumoral T cell trafficking.
