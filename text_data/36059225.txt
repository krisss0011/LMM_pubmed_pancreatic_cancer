Pancreatic cancer (PC) is highly fatal, and its incidence is increasing in the United States. Population-based registry studies suggest associations between a few autoimmune conditions and PC risk, albeit based on a relatively small number of cases. We conducted a population-based, nested case-control study to examine the associations between autoimmune conditions and PC risk within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER)-Medicare population. Incident primary malignant PC cases (n = 80 074) were adults â‰¥66 years and diagnosed between 1992 and 2015. Controls (n = 320 296) were alive at the time cases were diagnosed and frequency-matched to cases (4:1 ratio) by age, sex, and year of diagnosis. We used multivariable-adjusted, unconditional logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for 45 autoimmune conditions identified from Medicare claims. Eight autoimmune conditions including ankylosing spondylitis (OR = 1.45; 95% CI: 1.14-1.84), Graves' disease (OR = 1.18; 95% CI: 1.03-1.34), localized scleroderma (OR = 1.27; 95% CI: 1.06-1.52), pernicious anemia (OR = 1.08; 95% CI: 1.02-1.14), primary sclerosing cholangitis (OR = 1.37; 95% CI: 1.18-1.59), pure red cell aplasia (OR = 1.31; 95% CI: 1.16-1.47), type 1 diabetes (OR = 1.11; 95% CI: 1.07-1.15), and ulcerative colitis (OR = 1.18; 95% CI: 1.07-1.31) were associated with increased PC risk (false discovery rate-adjusted P values <.10). In subtype analyses, these conditions were associated with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, whereas only ulcerative colitis was associated with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Our results support the hypothesis that autoimmune conditions may play a role in PC development.
