Examination of fine needle aspirations and small core biopsies of the pancreas can be an extremely difficult and treacherous area for the diagnostic pathologist. The pancreas often yields small and often fragmented specimens, which, in combination with the morphologic overlap between numerous neoplastic and nonneoplastic mimickers, generate multiple potential diagnostic pitfalls. The authors review this challenging topic and provide insight into resolving these pitfalls using morphologic pattern recognition and ancillary testing.
