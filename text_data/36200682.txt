This study was designed to explore the effects of exosomal miR-421 secreted by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) on pancreatic cancer (PC) progression and the mechanisms involved. CAFs and exosomes (exos) were isolated and identified. PC cells were treated with CAF-derived exos (CAF-exos). Western blotting and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were used to measure miR-421, sirtuin-3 (SIRT3), and hypoxia duciblefactors-1 alpha (HIF-1α) levels. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), wound-healing, and transwell migration assays were used to measure proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities of the cells. Dual-luciferase assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) experiment analyzed the relationship between miR-421 and SIRT3. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (f)-verified H3K9Ac enrichment in the HIF-1α promoter region. In vivo tumorigenesis experiments were performed to further explore the effects of exosomal miR-421 from CAFs on PC. CAFs and exos were successfully isolated. CAF-exo-treated PC cells highly expressed miR-421 and had increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities. Knocking down miR-421 increased the expression of SIRT3. SIRT3 is a target of miR-421, and inhibiting the expression of SIRT3 reversed the negative effects of miR-421 knockdown on PC cell. Knocking down miR-421 in CAF-exo inhibited the expression of HIF-1α in PC cells. Moreover, SIRT3-mediated HIF-1α expression by regulating H3K9Ac. HIF-1α overexpression reversed the inhibiting effects of SIRT3 overexpression on PC progression and counteracted the inhibiting effects of miR-421 knockdown on glycolysis. Moreover, in vivo tumorigenesis experiments showed that knocking down miR-421 attenuated CAF-exo induced tumor growth. Exosomal miR-421 from CAFs promoted PC progression by regulating the SIRT3/H3K9Ac/HIF-1α axis. This study provided insights into the molecular mechanism of PC.
