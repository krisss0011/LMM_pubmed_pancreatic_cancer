Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is lethal in 88% of patients1, yet harbours 
mutation-derived T cell neoantigens that are suitable for vaccines 2,3. Here in a phase I trial 
of adjuvant autogene cevumeran, an individualized neoantigen vaccine based on uridine 
mRNA–lipoplex nanoparticles, we synthesized mRNA neoantigen vaccines in real time 
from surgically resected PDAC tumours. After surgery, we sequentially administered 
atezolizumab (an anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy), autogene cevumeran (a maximum of 20 
neoantigens per patient) and a modified version of a four-drug chemotherapy regimen 
(mFOLFIRINOX, comprising folinic acid, fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin).  
The end points included vaccine-induced neoantigen-specific T cells by high- threshold assays, 18-month recurrence-free survival and oncologic feasibility. We  
treated 16 patients with atezolizumab and autogene cevumeran, then 15 patients with 
mFOLFIRINOX. Autogene cevumeran was administered within 3 days of benchmarked 
times, was tolerable and induced de novo high-magnitude neoantigen-specific T cells in 
8 out of 16 patients, with half targeting more than one vaccine neoantigen. Using a new 
mathematical strategy to track T cell clones (CloneTrack) and functional assays, we 
found that vaccine-expanded T cells comprised up to 10% of all blood T cells, re-expanded 
with a vaccine booster and included long-lived polyfunctional neoantigen-specific 
effector CD8
+ T cells. At 18-month median follow-up, patients with vaccine-expanded 
T cells (responders) had a longer median recurrence-free survival (not reached) 
compared with patients without vaccine-expanded T cells (non-responders; 13.4 months, 
P = 0.003). Differences in the immune fitness of the patients did not confound this 
correlation, as responders and non-responders mounted equivalent immunity to a 
concurrent unrelated mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Thus, adjuvant atezolizumab, 
autogene cevumeran and mFOLFIRINOX induces substantial T cell activity that may correlate with delayed PDAC recurrence.
PDAC is the third leading cause of cancer death in the United States4 and 
the seventh worldwide5. With an increasing incidence6, and a survival 
rate of 12%1 that has remained largely stagnant for nearly 60 years1, 
PDAC is projected to cause even greater global cancer deaths by 2025 
(refs. 6,7). Surgery is the only curative treatment for PDAC. Yet, despite 
surgery, nearly 90% of patients have disease recurrence at a median 
of 7–9 months8,9, and the 5-year overall survival (OS) is only 8–10%8,9. 
Although adjuvant multiagent chemotherapies delay recurrence and are standard of care in surgically resected PDAC, nearly 80% of patients 
have disease recurrence at around 14 months4, and their 5-year OS is 
<30%10. Radiation, biologics and targeted therapies are also ineffective4.
PDACs are almost completely insensitive (<5% response rate11,12) to 
immune checkpoint inhibitors. This insensitivity is partially attributed 
to the fact that PDACs have a low mutation rate that generates few neo -
antigens12, mutation-generated proteins absent from healthy tissues 
that mark cancers as foreign to T cells, thus potenially rendering PDACs https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06063-y

tions have shown that most PDACs in fact harbour more neoantigens2,3,13 
than previously predicted14. Furthermore, studies of long-term survi-
vors of PDAC2,3 have revealed that neoantigens may stimulate T cells 
in PDAC. Primary tumours enriched in immunogenic neoantigens 
also harbour around 12-fold higher densities of activated CD8+ T cells, 
which correlates with delayed disease recurrence and longer patient 
survival. Thus, as most PDACs harbour neoantigens with the poten -
tial to stimulate T cells, strategies to deliver neoantigens may induce 
neoantigen-specific T cells and affect patient outcomes.
Based on the observation that long-term survivors of PDAC mount 
spontaneous T cell responses against tumour-specific neoantigens not 
shared among patients2,3, we tested whether adjuvant individualized 
vaccines can stimulate neoantigen-specific T cells and provide clinical 
benefit in patients with surgically resected PDAC. Therapeutic mRNA 
vaccine technology has facilitated the rapid delivery of individualized 
neoantigen vaccines fully integrated into a routine oncologic work -
flow15. Moreover, mRNA can be rapidly manufactured as individualized 
vaccines with multiple neoantigens16, can activate antigen-presenting 
cells17–20 and can be efficiently delivered using newly developed 
clinical-stage formulations21. Therefore, we hypothesized that an effec-
tive individualized mRNA vaccine would induce neoantigen-specific 
T cells in PDAC, eliminate micrometastases and delay recurrence.
To test this hypothesis, we conducted an investigator-initiated, 
phase I clinical trial of sequential adjuvant atezolizumab (Genentech), 
autogene cevumeran22, 23 (an individualized mRNA neoantigen vaccine 
containing up to 20 major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) 
and MHC class II (MHCII) restricted neoantigens in lipoplex nanoparti -
cles intravenously delivered; Individualized NeoAntigen-Specific Ther -
apy (iNeST), BioNTech and Genentech) and mFOLFIRINOX in patients 
with surgically resectable PDAC (Fig. 1a) to : (1) amplify neoantigen-  
specific T cells inhibited by PD-1 signalling; and (2) prime naive T cells 
to vaccine neoantigens.
Safety, feasibility and immunogenicity
From December 2019 to August 2021, we enrolled 34 patients, of which 
28 patients (Fig.  1b) underwent surgery. We then treated 19 patients 
with atezolizumab, of which 16 patients received subsequent autogene 
cevumeran. Fifteen out of these 16 patients also received subsequent 
mFOLFIRINOX (Fig.  1b). We analysed safety in a safety-evaluable 
cohort (n  = 19 patients treated with atezolizumab, n  = 16 treated with 
autogene cevumeran), and we correlated immune response to RFS in a 
biomarker-evaluable cohort (n  = 16 patients treated with atezolizumab 
and autogene cevumeran). All 19 evaluable participants had clinical 
characteristics typical of patients with resectable PDAC (Extended Data 
Fig. 1a). All patients were treated and followed at the Memorial Sloan Ket -
tering Cancer Center (MSK) during and beyond the enrolment period.
None of the 19 patients treated with atezolizumab in the safety-  
evaluable cohort had grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs; Fig. 1c ). 
One out of 16 (6%) patients treated with autogene cevumeran in the 
safety-evaluable cohort had grade 3 AEs (fever and hypertension; 
Fig.  1c). All 16 patients (100%) who received autogene cevumeran had 
grade 1–2 AEs (Extended Data Fig. 1c). We administered atezolizumab 
and autogene cevumeran at median times within 1 and 3 days of respec -
tive benchmarked times (median time to atezolizumab was 6.1 weeks 
(range of 4.3–7.9 weeks); median time to autogene cevumeran was 
9.4 weeks (range of 7.4–11.0 weeks); Fig.  1d). Only 1 patient out of 19 (5%) 
had insufficient neoantigens that led to non-manufacture of the vac -
cine (Fig.  1b). Three out of 16 patients (19%) did not receive all 9 vaccine 
doses (Fig.  1d), which was due to progression, death or mFOLFIRINOX 
toxicity. Thus, autogene cevumeran can be rapidly administered even 
after complex oncologic surgery.
Next, to measure the T cell responses induced by autogene cevu -
meran, we utilized a previously described ex vivo IFNγ ELISpot assay24 that detects high-magnitude T cell responses to vaccines without dis -
tinguishing CD8+ from CD4+ T cell responses. Eight out of 16 (50%) 
patients who received the vaccine generated T cell responses that were 
detected by ex vivo IFNγ ELISpot, and were deemed autogene cevu -
meran responders (Fig.  1e). By testing each specific target included in 
the neoantigen vaccines, we detected that 25 out of the 230 neoanti -
gens (11%) administered across all patients who were evaluable at the single-target level induced a T cell response of sufficient high magni-
tude to be detectable by ex vivo IFNγ ELISpot (Fig. 1e and Extended 
Data Fig. 2a). Half of all the patients who received the vaccine mounted 
neoantigen-specific T cell responses against at least one vaccine neo -
antigen (median = 2, range = 1–8; Extended Data Fig. 2b). Furthermore, 
half of these responses were polytopic, targeting more than one vac -
cine neoantigen (Fig. 1e,f ). No T cell responses against vaccine neo -
antigens were detectable before vaccination by ex vivo IFNγ ELISpot 
(Fig. 1f ). Neoantigen-specific immune responses after vaccination 
were detected at levels that ranged from approximately 100 spots per 
million bulk peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to >2,000 
spots per million bulk PBMCs (Fig. 1g ). Inter-patient variation in the 
number and magnitude of all responses and intra-patient variation in 
the magnitude of polytopic responses were observed (Fig. 1g). Thus, 
autogene cevumeran induces substantial de novo T cell responses in 
a large proportion of patients with PDAC.
T cell clonotypes and phenotypes
To confirm ELISpot assay reactivity using an orthogonal technique and 
to probe the diversity and specificity of autogene-cevumeran-expanded 
T cell clones, we developed CloneTrack. CloneTrack is a new math -
ematical and immunological method that uses T cell receptor (TCR) 
Vβ sequencing of peripheral blood samples before and after treat -
ment to identify treatment-expanded high-magnitude T cell clones 
(Methods). Using CloneTrack, we detected vaccine-induced clonal 
expansion in 8 out of 8 responders and in 1 out of 8 non-responders 
(Fig. 2a,b and Extended Data Fig. 2d). In responders, autogene cevu -
meran expanded multiple clones (median of 7.5 clones; Fig. 2c ) from 
undetectable levels to up to 10% (median of 2.8%; Fig.  2c) of all blood 
T cells. Analogously, we applied CloneTrack to peripheral blood sam-
ples collected before and after atezolizumab treatment and found 
that autogene-cevumeran-expanded T cell clones did not overlap with 
atezolizumab-expanded T cell clones (Extended Data Fig. 3a–c). To 
assess the antigen specificity of autogene-cevumeran-expanded T cell 
clones, we identified T cell clones specific to ELISpot-identified immu -
nodominant neoantigens in vitro and examined the clonal overlap to 
autogene-cevumeran-expanded clones in vivo in 2 patients with mono -
topic responses and in 2 patients with polytopic responses (Fig.  2d 
and Extended Data Fig. 4a,b). Three out of 4 patients (75%) and 51% 
(n = 21 out of 41 clones) of vaccine-expanded high-magnitude clones 
(28 out of 41 clones detected in 1 patient) contained immunodominant 
neoantigen-specific clones (Fig.  2e). In the fourth patient (patient 11), 
the immunodominant neoantigen-specific clones were in a lower mag -
nitude vaccine-expanded clonal pool (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Thus, 
autogene cevumeran expands de novo polyclonal neoantigen-specific 
T cells in PDAC.
We next studied the phenotype and function of autogene-  
cevumeran-expanded T cells. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we 
found that autogene-cevumeran-expanded high-magnitude clones 
were CD8+ T cells that expressed lytic markers (perforin 1 and gran -
zyme B) and cytokines (IFNγ) and resembled effector T cells induced 
by protective viral vaccines25 (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 5a–c). 
Consistently, peripheral blood samples collected after vaccination con -
tained polyfunctional CD8+ T cells but not CD4+ T cells that produced 
cytokines (IFNγ and TNF) and degranulated on in vitro rechallenge 
with both long neopeptides (Fig. 2g and Extended Data Fig. 5d) and 
MHCI-restricted minimal epitopes (Fig.  2h and Extended Data Fig. 5e). 146 | Nature | Vol 618 | 1 June 2023
ArticleNotably, autogene-cevumeran-expanded T cells maintained functional -
ity despite post-vaccination mFOLFIRINOX treatment, with persistent 
IFNγ production (Fig.  1f), uniform re-expansion with a vaccine booster 
in all responders (Fig. 2i) and sustained persistence as high as 2.5% of 
all blood T cells up to 2 years after surgery (Fig.  2c and Supplementary 
Table 1). Furthermore, vaccine boosters re-expanded identical primed 
clones in 7 out of 7 patients who received boosters (47% of all primed 
clones; Fig.  2i and Extended Data Fig. 6). Although autogene cevumeran 
expanded multiple clones, standard flow cytometry did not reliably 
detect T cell expansion and activation (Extended Data Fig. 5f). Collec-
tively, autogene cevumeran substantially expanded T cells that included 
vaccine neoantigen-specific, functional and durable CD8+ T cells.
Vaccine response and clinical outcome
At a median follow-up of 18 months that extended beyond the prespeci -
fied secondary end point, the median OS and RFS of the patients in the  safety-evaluable cohort were not reached (Fig.  3a). For patients in the 
biomarker-evaluable cohort, the 8 autogene cevumeran responders 
had a median RFS that was not reached compared with the 8 non-  
responders who had a median RFS of 13.4 months (P = 0.003, hazard 
ratio (HR) = 0.08 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01–0.4); Fig.  3b).  
To exclude a time-to-response bias26, we performed a landmark analysis 
to correlate RFS to response in patients who were recurrence-free when 
completing all 8 autogene cevumeran priming doses (landmark RFS). 
The median landmark RFS was similarly not reached in responders com -
pared with 11.0 months in non-responders (P = 0.008, HR = 0.06 (95% 
CI 0.008–0.40); Fig.  3b). Consistently, compared with non-responders, 
responders had persistently lower serum CA19-9 levels (Extended Data 
Fig. 7a), the most widely used clinical PDAC biomarker27. Only 25% of 
patients in the biomarker-evaluable cohort had detectable circulat -
ing tumour DNA at diagnosis (Extended Data Fig. 7b), as previously 
reported in patients with resectable PDAC tumours28,29, and thus was 
not a reliable biomarker of recurrence. To identify if responders were

Articlemerely enriched in patients with better prognosis, we found response 
to atezolizumab, lymph node positivity, margin positivity, primary 
tumour size, the number of chemotherapy doses and density of 
intratumoural CD8+ T cells did not correlate with vaccine response 
(Extended Data Figs. 1b and 7c–e). Responders and non-responders 
also had comparable immunological fitness, as they mounted equiva -
lent humoral and cellular responses to an unrelated mRNA vaccine 
(SARS-CoV-2) that was concurrently administered with autogene 
cevumeran (Extended Data Fig. 8). Responders and non-responders 
also had equivalent peripheral frequencies of all major innate and 
adaptive immune cells (Extended Data Fig. 9a–c), and similar somatic 
and germline genetic characteristics (Supplementary Tables 2–4).  
In summary, the autogene-cevumeran-expanded T cell response cor-
relates with delayed PDAC recurrence that is not confounded by detect -
able differences in patient selection, intratumoural T cell frequency or 
peripheral T cell frequency or fitness.
As autogene cevumeran induced high-magnitude T cell responses 
specific to 25 out of 106 vaccine-encoded neoantigens (24%) in respond -
ers (Extended Data Fig. 2a), we searched for correlates of vaccine 
response. Our previous findings2,3,30 showed that CD8+ T-cell-enriched 
PDAC tumours are also enriched in immunogenic ‘high-quality’ neo -
antigens distributed in greater proportions across tumour clones. 
Therefore, we examined whether tumour clonality and neoantigen 
quality correlate with vaccine-induced T cell responses. Consistently, 
responders to autogene cevumeran had more clonal tumours than 
non-responders (Extended Data Fig. 10a). Next, we examined whether 
immunogenic neoantigens in responders contained high-quality fea-
tures. We adapted our previously described model2,3 (Methods) that 
identifies spontaneously targeted neoantigens in tumours to cor -
relate immunogenicity to the quality of vaccinated neoantigens. In 
responders, neoantigen quality as a continuous variable correlated with  
vaccine neoantigens that induced IFNγ ELISpot responses (Extended 
Data Fig. 10b). Notably, non-responders had similar numbers of non-synonymous mutations and vaccine neoantigens as responders 
(Extended Data Fig. 2c).
Vaccine clones and a micrometastasis
Patient 29 responded to autogene cevumeran with the second-  
highest maximal percentage of expanded blood T cells (Fig.  2b) that 
included vaccine neoantigen-specific polyfunctional CD8+ T cells 
(Extended Data Fig. 5d,e). Patient 29 developed increased serum CA19-9 
levels with a new 7-mm liver lesion suggestive of a metastasis after 
vaccine priming (Fig.  4a). A biopsy sample did not reveal malignant 
cells but a dense lymphoid infiltrate (Fig. 4b , left) that included all 15 
autogene-cevumeran-expanded (Fig. 4b , middle) CD8+ T cell clones 
with phenotypic evidence of lytic and effector potential (Fig.  4d). Digital  
droplet PCR revealed that this lymphoid infiltrate contained rare cells 
harbouring the TP53R175H mutation, identical to the R175H driver muta -
tion in the primary tumour of this patient (Fig.  4c and Extended Data 
Fig. 10c). This liver lesion disappeared on subsequent imaging (Fig.  4a), 
which suggests that autogene-cevumeran-expanded T cells may pos-
sess the capacity to eradicate micrometastases.
Discussion
We demonstrated that adjuvant autogene cevumeran, an individualized 
neoantigen vaccine based on uridine mRNA–lipoplex nanoparticles, in 
combination with atezolizumab and mFOLFIRINOX, is safe, feasible and 
generates substantial neoantigen-specific T cells in 50% of unselected 
patients with resectable PDAC. Vaccine-expanded T cells were durable, 
persisting up to 2 years despite post-vaccination mFOLFIRINOX treat -
ment. High-magnitude vaccine-induced T cell responses, the focus of 
our immune response analysis that included a new method to track 
vaccine-expanded clones, correlated with delayed PDAC recurrence. 
Despite the limited sample size, these early results warrant larger stud -
ies of individualized mRNA neoantigen vaccines in PDAC.
As multiple immunotherapies31 have emerged for immune-inflamed 
tumours, there remains a need for new immunotherapies for the major -
ity of patients with non-inflamed tumours that are largely insensitive 
to current immunotherapies. Indeed, the prevailing thought has 
been that the low passenger mutation rate of such tumours renders 
them with insufficient neoantigens for vaccines. Here, we provided  
evidence that despite the low mutation rate of PDAC, a mRNA vac -
cine can induce T cell activity against neoantigens in this cancer, a 
non-inflamed tumour with predominantly immune-excluded or desert 
phenotypes. Whether mRNA neoantigen vaccines can similarly activate 
T cells in other non-inflamed cancers should be more broadly tested.
We did not find evidence that the correlation of vaccine response to 
delayed recurrence is confounded by known prognostic variables, such 
as lymph node or margin-positive disease. Non-responders on average 
had slightly larger primary tumours than responders; however, larger 
primary tumour size did not correlate with shorter RFS. As the uridine 
mRNA–lipoplex vaccine technology is based on potent antigen delivery 
into lymphoid compartments and stimulates weak T cell responses in 
splenectomized mice20, it is notable that non-responders were also mar -
ginally enriched in patients with splenectomies (Extended Data Fig. 1b). 
Furthermore, that vaccines induced high-magnitude T cell responses in 
50% of patients may highlight the need for biomarkers to select optimal 
patients and tumours for this treatment. Of note, although autogene 
cevumeran is designed to activate both neoantigen-specific CD4+ and 
CD8+ T cells and we find it activates high magnitude CD8+ T cells in 
PDAC, the primary and confirmatory immune response assays in this 
study do not distinguish CD8+ from CD4+ T cell responses. In fact, as 
these assays bias towards high-magnitude T cell responses, assays 
that detect lower magnitude responses may include both CD4+ T cell 
responses and pre-existing responses. In other tumours, we observed 
that a substantial proportion of vaccine neoantigens induce de novo b

script in preparation), a level of response not assessed in this trial. 
Nevertheless, our results in PDAC imply that a high-magnitude T cell 
response may contribute to a favourable clinical outcome. Thus, 
strategies to ensure high-magnitude responses are being pursued, 
including further optimization of mRNA vaccine potency and exten -
sion of the neoantigen discovery space to include genetic aberra -
tions other than single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and insertions 
and deletions (indels) (for example, fusions)32. Notwithstanding, as 
vaccines expand polyclonal T cells, whether vaccine-induced clonal 
diversity contributes to durable control33,34 is another key query for  
future work.
Our study was not powered to detect differences in biomarkers of 
vaccine response. Despite this limitation, we observed that tumours 
in responders were more clonal—possibly representing tumours in 
immune-edited evolution as seen in immunogenic PDACs in long-term 
survivors3. Thus, we speculate that a more clonal primary tumour may 
reflect the ability of the immune system to recognize a tumour and 
therefore respond to a vaccine. Moreover, the observation that neo -
antigen quality2,3,30 correlates with immunogenic vaccine neoantigens 
provides further support for the concept that select neoantigens may 
possess higher immunogenic qualities that are possibly desirable for 
vaccines. However, in this trial, as responders and non-responders had 
comparable numbers of vaccine neoantigens drawn from a similar 
number of tumour mutations, we consider that an absence of a response 
in non-responders is unlikely due to a failure to include immunogenic 
neoantigens. Overall, these observations remain preliminary but  
support future investigation of whether tumour clonality and neo -
antigen quality could serve as biomarkers of vaccine response.We tested individualized mRNA cancer vaccines in the adjuvant 
setting motivated by observations that vaccines against pathogens 
have historically been most effective in preventive and not therapeutic 
settings, which likely reflects that vaccine efficacy requires an opti -
mally functioning host immune system. In patients with advanced 
cancer, global impairments in host immunity and knowledge gaps 
on neoantigen heterogeneity between tumours may hamper neoan -
tigen vaccination. Thus, we propose that vaccines should be tested 
in patients with minimal residual disease, as is currently ongoing in trials in high-risk colorectal cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier 
NCT04486378) and in triple-negative breast cancer (ClinicalTrials.
gov identifier NCT02316457 ). Notably, our study demonstrated that 
mRNA neoantigen vaccines can be individualized in 9 weeks and fully 
integrated into a standard clinical workflow even after complex onco -
logic surgery. Given this trial was the index experience with individu-alized mRNA vaccination for PDAC, mFOLFIRINOX was administered 
>12 weeks35–37 after surgery. Furthermore, given its limited sample 
size, this trial enrolled only white individuals. Future studies must 
test individualized mRNA neoantigen vaccines in a diverse popula -
tion of patients with PDAC, coupled with a faster time to adjuvant 
mFOLFIRINOX. Experience with individualized cancer vaccines16 that 
predated and accelerated mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 pandemic vac -
cines38 can now further hasten individualized cancer vaccine manu -
facture times22,23 and enable more rapid adjuvant custom vaccination  
and chemotherapy.
Overall, we reported preliminary evidence that adjuvant autogene 
cevumeran, an individualized mRNA neoantigen vaccine, in combina -
tion with atezolizumab and mFOLFIRINOX induces substantial T cell 
activity in patients with surgically resected PDAC that correlates with a

Trial design, treatments, oversight and conduct
We administered atezolizumab, autogene cevumeran and mFOL -
FIRINOX sequentially to measure how each immunotherapy mod -
ulated neoantigen-specific T cells. To establish clinical feasibility, 
we set the following benchmarked times to treatment after surgery 
(Fig.  1a): (1) one 1,200 mg intravenous dose of atezolizumab on week 6;  
(2) nine 25 µg intravenous doses of autogene cevumeran given 
as seven weekly priming doses beginning on week 9, an eighth  
dose at week 17 and a ninth booster dose at week 46; (3) 12 cycles of  
mFOLFIRINOX beginning on week 21. As the half-life of atezolizumab 
is 27 days, with receptor occupancy persisting for several months39,40, 
we hypothesized that this dosing scheme would allow sufficient PD-L1 receptor occupancy to support proficient T cell activation 
by autogene cevumeran. Additional details are in provided in the  
protocol in Supplementary Data 1. As we treated the first patient before the COVID-19 pandemic, patients received SARS-CoV-2 vaccines as they became available either before, interspersed 
 
during or following completion of individual experimental treat -
ments.
We conducted the study in accordance with the Declaration of 
Helsinki and good clinical practice guidelines. The study was approved 
by the institutional review board at MSK, the US Food Drug Adminis -
tration and was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT04161755 ). All 
participants provided written informed consent.
Immune response assays
We investigated peripheral blood samples using two independent 
assays. Both, per design, detect high-magnitude T cell responses to 
vaccines without distinguishing CD8+ from CD4+ T cell responses. IFNγ 
ELISpot was performed ex vivo (that is, without previous expansion in 
culture to capture T cells below the assay threshold) to map the induc-
tion of neoantigen-specific T cell responses for each vaccine target used 
across all patients. Patients were classified as responders to autogene 
cevumeran if the IFNγ ELISpot assay detected T cell reactivity against at least one vaccine neoantigen.
To confirm IFNγ ELISpot results using an orthogonal technique, 
we used TCR Vβ sequencing-based CloneTrack to detect greater than  
twofold in vivo expansion of T cell clones to vaccines in a non-antigen-  
specific manner. Clones that expanded at different treatment  
times (before and after atezolizumab; before and after autogene  
cevumeran) further distinguished atezolizumab from autogene-  
cevumeran-expanded T cell clones. For 6 ELISpot-identified immuno -
dominant neoantigens in 4 out of 8 (50%) autogene cevumeran respond -
ers, we used TCR Vβ sequencing of in vitro neopeptide-stimulated 
T cells to validate the specificity of in vivo vaccine-expanded T cell 
clones.
Patients
We enrolled patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
performance status of 0–1 with single, radiographically suspicious, 
surgically resectable PDACs, no distant metastases and ≥5 neoantigens. 
We excluded patients with metastatic, borderline or locally unresect-able PDACs, and patients who received neoadjuvant therapy.
After surgery, we included patients with pathologically confirmed 
PDAC with R0/R1 margins. Additional eligibility criteria and ethical 
study conduct information are in the protocol (Supplementary Data 1). 
We aimed to accrue 20 evaluable patients.
Surgery
Patients underwent open pancreaticoduodenectomy or either open or 
laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy at MSK. We then 
transported tumour blocks with the most (minimum ≥10%) histological 
tumour content with matched blood to BioNTech.End points
The primary end point was safety (Extended Data Table 1). Secondary 
end points were 18-month RFS and 18-month OS. We defined recur -
rence as new lesions on the basis of response evaluation criteria in 
solid tumours (v.1.1), and RFS from either the date of surgery (RFS) or 
from the date of the last autogene cevumeran priming dose (landmark 
RFS) to the date of recurrence or death, whichever occurred first. We 
censored patients without events at the last known date they were 
recurrence-free. We defined OS from the date of surgery to the date 
of death. As exploratory end points, we measured immune response 
and feasibility as actual compared with benchmarked treatment times. 
Data cut-off was 1 April 2022, extending the median follow-up beyond 
the prespecified 18-month RFS secondary end point.
Mutation identification and neoantigen selection
DNA was extracted from PBMCs. DNA and RNA were extracted from 
tumours. Expressed non-synonymous mutations and HLA type were 
identified by whole-exome sequencing of patient-specific tumour–
normal pairs and tumour RNA sequencing. Neoantigens were bioin -
formatically predicted and ranked by immunogenicity as previously 
described16. mRNA vaccine neoantigen characteristics are detailed in 
Supplementary Table 5.
Somatic and germline mutation testing
For the detection of somatic tumour mutations in key cancer genes, we 
used MSK-IMPACT, a previously published targeted tumour-sequencing 
test that covers 468 cancer genes41.
For the detection of germline mutations, we utilized the MSK-IMPACT 
panel to detect pathogenic germline variants. In brief, gDNA was 
enriched for targeted regions using a hybridization-based protocol 
and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq instrument. Sequence reads were 
aligned to the GRCh37/hg19 reference human genome and variants 
(SNVs, small indels, and copy number variants encompassing one or 
more exons) were called using publicly available and in-house devel -
oped bioinformatics tools. Variants were classified according to the 
American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines42. Only 
variants classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic are reported. 
The list of mutations analysed in the MSK-IMPACT germline panel are provided in Supplementary Table 4.
Production benchmarks
We set the following a priori benchmarks from surgery to vaccine manu -
facture: (1) transport specimen from operating room to pathology in ≤5 min; (2) fix specimen in formalin and embed in paraffin in ≤15 min; 
(3) select blocks for vaccine production in ≤2 days; (4) ship to BioNTech 
in ≤72 h; (5) produce vaccines in ≤6 weeks; (6) administer first dose of the vaccine in ≤9 weeks.
Autogene cevumeran manufacturing
For every patient, individualized mRNA neoantigen vaccines were 
manufactured under good manufacturing practice conditions contain -
ing two uridine-based mRNA strands with noncoding sequences opti -
mized for superior translational performance43, 44. Each strand encoded 
up to 10 MHCI and MHCII neoepitopes, formulated in approximately 
400 nm diameter lipoplex nanoparticles20 comprising the synthetic 
cationic lipid (R )-N ,N,N-trimethyl-2,3-dioleyloxy-1-propanaminium 
chloride (DOTMA) and the phospholipid 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-  
phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) to enable intravenous delivery.
Cell culture
We purified patient PBMCs from blood samples by density centrifuga -
tion over Ficoll-Paque Plus (GE Healthcare). We purified healthy donor 
PBMCs from buffy coats (New York Blood Center) and isolated T cells using a Pan-T cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotech). We activated T cells Articlewith CD3/CD28 beads (Thermo Fisher) with IL-7 (3,000 IU ml–1) and 
IL-15 (100 IU ml–1) (Miltenyi Biotec), and transduced T cells on day 2 
after activation. Virus-producing cell lines (H29 and RD114-envelope 
producers) were as previously described45,46. We cultured T cells and 
K562 cells in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS (Nucleus 
Biologics), 100 U ml–1 penicillin–streptomycin (Thermo Fisher 
Gibco) and 2 mM l -glutamine (Thermo Fisher Gibco). We cultured 
patient PBMCs with RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 mM 
sodium pyruvate, 2 mM l -glutamine, non-essential amino acids and 
2-mercaptoethanol (MSK medium preparation core facility). We cul -
tured H29, RD114-envelope producers and Phoenix-AMPHO in DMEM 
medium supplemented with 10% FBS (Nucleus Biologics), 100 U ml–1 
penicillin–streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Gibco) and 2 mM l -glutamine 
(Thermo Fisher Gibco).
Immune response
Ex vivo IFNγ ELISpot. Multiscreen filter plates (Merck Millipore), pre -
coated with antibodies specific for IFNγ (Mabtech), were washed with 
PBS and blocked with X-VIVO 15 (Lonza) containing 2% human serum 
albumin (CSL-Behring) for 1–5 h. Next, 3 × 105 effector cells per well 
were stimulated for 16–20 h with pools of 15-amino-acid-long peptides 
( JPT Peptide Technologies) overlapping by 11 amino acids covering the 
length of each target. Cryopreserved PBMCs were subjected to ELIS -
pot after a resting period of 2–5 h at 37 °C. All tests were performed in  
duplicate and included anti-CD3 (Mabtech) as a positive control. Bound 
IFNγ was visualized using a secondary antibody directly conjugated 
with alkaline phosphatase (ELISpotPro kit, Mabtech). Next, plates were 
incubated with BCIP/NBT (5-bromo-4-chloro-3′-indolyl phosphate and 
nitro blue tetrazolium) substrate (ELISpotPro kit, Mabtech). Plates 
were scanned using an AID Classic Robot ELISPOT reader and analysed  
using AID ELISPOT 7.0 software (AID Autoimmun Diagnostika). A sam -
ple was deemed positive if the IFNγ ELISpot count exceeded a minimum 
threshold of 7 spots per 300,000 PBMCs. A post-vaccination PBMC 
sample was deemed positive on the basis of a significant increase in 
ELISpot count compared with a negative control (medium alone, as 
no IFNγ ELISpot responses were detected in pre-vaccination samples). 
To account for varying sample quality reflected in the number of spots 
in response to anti-CD3 antibody stimulation, we applied a normali -
zation method that enabled direct comparison of spot counts and 
strength of response between individuals, as described previously24,47,48. 
Statistical significance was determined based on two statistical tests 
(distribution-free resampling)47,48.
TCR Vβ clone tracking (CloneTrack). For TCR Vβ sequencing, we 
prepared gDNA from bulk PBMCs or purified T cells using a Qiagen 
DNA extraction kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. We 
quantified samples using Dropsense 96 and diluted to standard con -
centrations for library preparation. We generated sample data using an 
immunoSEQ Assay (Adaptive Biotechnologies). In brief, the somatically 
rearranged TCRB CDR3 was amplified49,50 from gDNA using a two-step, 
amplification bias-controlled multiplex PCR approach. The first PCR 
consists of forward and reverse amplification primers specific for every 
known V and J gene segment, and amplifies the hypervariable CDR3 of 
the immune receptor locus. The second PCR adds a proprietary barcode 
sequence and Illumina adapter sequences51. In addition, reference 
gene primers were included in the PCR reaction to quantify total nucle -
ated cells that can be sequenced and to accurately measure the frac -
tion of T cells in each sample. CDR3 and reference gene libraries were  
sequenced on an Illumina instrument according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. Raw sequence reads were demultiplexed according to 
Adaptive’s proprietary barcode sequences. Demultiplexed reads were 
further processed to remove adapter and primer sequences and to 
identify and remove primer dimer, germline and other contaminant 
sequences. The filtered data were clustered using both the relative fre -
quency ratio between similar clones and a modified nearest-neighbour algorithm to merge closely related sequences to correct for technical  
errors introduced through PCR and sequencing. The resulting  
sequences were sufficient to annotate the V, D and J genes and the N1 and N2 regions constituting each unique CDR3 and the translation of 
the encoded CDR3 amino acid sequence. Gene definitions were based 
on annotation in accordance with the IMGT database (https://www.
imgt.org). The set of observed biological TCRB CDR3 sequences were 
normalized to correct for residual multiplex PCR amplification bias and 
quantified against a set of synthetic TCRB CDR3 sequence analogues50.
T cell clone definition. We identified and tracked T cell clones by their 
β chain sequence (TRB), defined as the nucleotide CDR3 sequence 
(including the conserved C and F residues) and a deterministic V and 
J gene alignment. For T cells identified by single-cell sequencing, we 
similarly defined clones by the TRB sequence to map clones to paired 
TCR Vβ sequencing. Owing to the higher entropy of the nucleotide 
CDR3 sequence generation probability distribution52, we used nucleo -
tide instead of amino acid CDR3 sequences to minimize the chance of conflating two different T cell clones (different original VDJ recombi-nation events). This becomes crucial to differentiate clones that may 
have different α chain (TRA) sequences, which are unobserved in the 
bulk TCR Vβ sequencing step. We used the provided deterministic 
V and J alignments from Adaptive Biotechnologies (for bulk TCR Vβ 
sequencing) and 10x (for single-cell sequencing).
T cell clone frequency estimation.  For a given sample of bulk TRB 
sequences, we estimated the total number of effective cells sequenced, 
N, as the summation of all productive (in-frame, no stop codons) reads. 
We excluded non-productive reads, as they must necessarily be recom -
bined CDR3s from silenced alleles (we did not model the fraction of 
productive reads from silenced alleles and assumed them to be a small 
correction). We estimated a T cell clone x’s cell count nx in a sample as 
the number of reads corresponding to the clone as defined above  
(V and J gene and nucleotide CDR3 sequence). We therefore estimated 
the frequency of clone x as f=xn
Nx. For the purpose of visualization, if 
we did not observe a clone in a sample, we used a pseudo-frequency of 
N1
3 (if plotting a trajectory with multiple samples, we used the largest 
N over the samples) and indicated this observation threshold as dotted 
black lines. We computed the aggregate frequency of several clones 
x X∈  in a similar fashion using an aggregate count n n =∑Xx Xx∈  and 
used the same convention for a pseudo-frequency if n=0X .
T cell clone significance determination. We took a statistically conserv -
ative approach to minimize the false-positive identification of expanded 
T cell clones. To this end, to calculate treatment-expanded T cell clones, 
we used a significance threshold of Padjusted  < 0.001, where the P  value is 
adjusted using Bonferroni correction (Padjusted   = P × no. of T cell clones) 
to account for the large number of T cell clones that were screened.
T cell expansion criteria. To identify treatment-expanded T cell clones, 
we used an adapted Fisher’s exact test and computed P  values for  
expanded T cell clones using a two-tailed adapted exact Fisher’s test for 
a twofold increase in a T cell clone between any two samples.
We implemented this by rescaling the repertoire size of the initial 
sample by half, to effectively reduce the sample size and the number 
of cells not belonging to the clone in question. We computed this as a Fisher’s exact test (implemented from scipy.stats.fisher_exact) using the categorical table supplied in Extended Data Table 2.
Clones that had a fold change <2 (that is, 
<2 ×m
Mn
Nxx) were assigned 
a P value of 1. These P values were then adjusted using Bonferroni cor-
rection: ∪ PP NM =×adjusted /uni2223/uni2223 , where ∪NM| | designates the number of 
unique clones in the union of the two samples.
We applied this T cell clone expansion P value in the following two 
contexts to determine whether atezolizumab or autogene cevumeran 
expanded T cell clones.Atezolizumab response: to determine whether atezolizumab 
expanded T cell clones (Extended Data Fig. 3), we compared the num-
ber of cells of a particular T cell clone in a blood sample taken on the 
day of but before atezolizumab administration to the number of cells 
of that T cell clone in a blood sample taken on the day of but before the 
first dose of autogene cevumeran. We then considered that a patient 
had a response to atezolizumab if any T cell clone was found to be sig -
nificantly expanded (Padjusted  < 0.001) according to the above outlined 
expansion criterion.
Autogene cevumeran response with priming doses: to determine 
whether autogene cevumeran expanded T cell clones, we imposed 
two criteria: (1) a quality control requirement that a T cell clone must 
have a minimum of three reads in at least two samples, and (2) the T cell 
clone must not be observed before vaccination (0 cells in all samples 
taken until the day of but before the first dose of autogene cevumeran).
Then, for clones that passed these criteria (as defined above), we 
compared the number of cells of a particular T cell clone in a blood 
sample taken after atezolizumab and before vaccination to the number 
of cells of that T cell clone in any blood sample taken until the day of but 
before the first dose of mFOLFIRINOX. We further assigned an expan-
sion P value as defined as the minimum adjusted expansion P  value for 
all samples, further adjusted by Bonferroni correction for the number 
of samples the expansion P values were computed for.
We then considered that a patient had a response to autogene cevu -
meran if any T cell clone significantly expanded (Padjusted  < 0.001) accord -
ing to the above outlined expansion criteria.
For 50% of the responders (n  = 4 patients), we further examined 
whether the autogene-cevumeran-expanded T cell clones included 
neoantigen-specific in vitro clones (see the section ‘In vitro stimulation 
and T cell clone specificity to peptides’ below).
Autogene cevumeran response with a booster dose: to determine 
whether an autogene-cevumeran-expanded clone further expanded 
after the booster dose, we used a standard Fisher’s exact test, with no 
additional fold change criteria, to compare the clone sizes in samples 
taken immediately before booster administration to samples from 
the first follow-up after the booster. As we had previously identified 
these clones and assessed each one independently, we did not use any 
multiple hypothesis adjustment and set a significance threshold of 
Padjusted  < 0.01 for boost expansion. Boost expansion was analysed in 
all patients with identified autogene-cevumeran-expanded clones, 
except for patient 5 who did not receive a booster.
In vitro stimulation and T cell clone specificity to peptides
We resuspended neopeptides (Genscript) in DMSO at 10 mg ml–1 and 
a SARS-CoV-2 peptide pool (Mabtech) following the manufacturer’s 
instructions. We stored all peptides at –80 °C. We restimulated PBMCs 
with peptides in vitro as previously described with minor modifica -
tions2. In brief, we cultured 1 × 106 PBMCs in a 48-well plate with indi -
vidual (10 µg ml–1) or pooled (1–5 µg ml–1 per peptide) peptides on day 1. 
We added IL-2 (100 U ml–1) and IL-15 (10 ng ml–1) on day 2 and every 
subsequent 2–3 days. On day 7, we restimulated cells with peptides 
and added a CD107a antibody (clone H4A3, PE, BD Biosciences) for 1 h 
at 37 °C. After 1 h, we added a protein transport inhibitor containing 
monensin (BD Biosciences) and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. We then 
stained the cells for additional surface or intracellular markers as per 
the manufacturer guidelines, and either analysed or purified cells based 
on CD107a surface expression, or analysed cells based on intracellular 
cytokine expression.
To determine whether a T cell clone was specifically stimulated by 
the peptide pool, we sorted and identified T cell clones in CD107a– and 
CD107a+ fractions after peptide stimulation as described above. We 
then determined a peptide-specificity stimulation P value for each 
T cell clone using a one-tailed binomial test P  value (implementing the 
scipy.stats.binom_test) with a 0.2 threshold (specifically, significance 
with respect to at least 20% of a clone being CD107a+ as opposed to CD107a–). We adjusted P  values using Bonferroni correction and deter -
mined significance at a Padjusted  < 0.001 threshold. We included DMSO 
as a control to identify nonspecifically stimulated T cell clones. Of all 
patients tested, only one nonspecific clone was identified (patient 10) 
as nonspecifically stimulated in DMSO and both screened peptide 
pools. This clone was therefore excluded as a peptide-specific clone.
HLA cloning and transduction
We cloned the HLA alleles into an SFG γ-retroviral vector53 and sequence-  
verified all plasmids (Genewiz). We transfected Phoenix-AMPHO 
cells with the plasmids using MegaTran 2.0 (OriGene). We collected 
virus-containing supernatants 48 h after transfection, added Polybrene 
(EMD Millipore) and spinoculated K562 cells for 2 h at 2,400 r.p.m. at 
33 °C. Seventy-two hours after transduction, we sorted HLA+ K562 cells 
using an Aria Cell sorter (BD Biosciences).
TCR cloning, transduction and peptide stimulations
We constructed TCR fragments as previously described54. In brief, we 
isolated TRB V-D-J and TRA V-J sequences from purified, sequenced 
single T cells and fused the TRB V-D-J and TRA V-J sequences to modi-
fied mouse constant TRB and TRA chain sequences54, respectively 
(gift from A. Gros) to prevent mispairing of transduced TCRs with the 
endogenous TCRs55. In brief, we joined TRB and TRA chains with a furin 
SGSG P2A linker, cloned the TCR constructs into a SFG γ-retroviral 
vector53 and sequence-verified all plasmids (Genewiz). We transfected 
H29 cells (gpg29 fibroblasts) with retrovirus vectors using calcium 
phosphate and produced VSV-G pseudo-typed retroviruses45. We next 
used Polybrene (Sigma) and virus-containing supernatants to generate 
stable RD114-enveloped producer cell lines46. We collected and con -
centrated virus-containing supernatants using a Retro-X Concentrator 
(Takara). We then coated non-tissue-culture treated 6-well plates with 
Retronectin (Takara), plated a titrated virus quantity to 3 × 106 activated 
T cells per well, centrifuged cells for 1 h at room temperature at 300g 
and used transduced T cells between day 7 and 14 after transduction 
or cryopreserved them for future use. To stimulate TCR-transduced 
T cells with peptides, we pulsed 5 × 104 (effector:target ratio 1:1) or 
2.5 × 105 (effector:target ratio of 1:5) HLA-transduced K562 cells (antigen 
presenting cells) in a 96-well U-bottom plate for 1 h at 37 °C with the 
indicated peptides at the indicated concentrations. After 1 h, we washed 
the peptide by centrifugation and added 5 × 104 TCR or mock (control) 
transduced T cells per well. We then measured CD137 (also known as 
4-1BB) expression on CD8+ mouse TCR+ T cells 24 h later.
Immunophenotyping by flow cytometry and optical impedance
For flow cytometry, PBMCs from patients were rested overnight at 37 °C 
and 5% CO2 before staining55. We defined TCR-transduced CD8+ T cells 
as live, CD3+, CD8+, mouse TCR+ cells. We stained cells with the follow -
ing antibodies: from BioLegend, CD62L (clone DREG-56, BV510), CD56 
(clone HCD56, BV605), CD4 (clone OKT4, BV650), CD19 (clone HIB19, BV711), FOXP3 (clone 206D, PE), CD3 (clone SK-7, PE-Cy7), CD8 (clone 
SK1, FITC or Alexa Fluor 700), CD45RA (clone HI100, APC), CD45 (clone 
2D1, Alexa Fluor 700), CD39 (clone A1, BV421), LAG-3 (clone 11C3C65, PerCP-Cy5.5), CD366 (clone F38-2E2, APC-Cy7) CD11c (clone S-HCL-3, 
BV421), HLA-DR (clone L243, BV785), CD14 (clone HCD14, PE), CD11b 
(clone ICRF44, APC), IFNγ (clone 4S.B3, BV421), mouse TRB (clone H57-
597, PE-Cy5), CD137 (clone 4B4-1, PE), HLA-A,B,C (clone W6/23, APC) 
and a Zombie Red Fixable Viability kit (423110); from BD Biosciences, 
PD-1 (clone EH12.1, BV786), TNF (clone MAb11, APC), CD107a (clone 
H4A3, PE), CD56 (clone NCAM16.2, BV786) and DAPI (564907); from 
ThermoFisher Scientific, Ki-67 (clone SolA15, PE-Cy5). We stained cells 
using antibody cocktails in the dark at 4 °C, washed and analysed on a 
FACS LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences) using FACSDiva (v.8.0.1) software 
(BD Biosciences). To examine the expression levels of intracellular 
markers, we surface-stained, fixed, permeabilized and stained the 
cells for intracellular proteins using a Fixation and Permeabilization ArticleBuffer kit per the manufacturer’s recommendations (Invitrogen). We 
used appropriate FMO controls as indicated. We analysed the data 
using FlowJo (v.10, Tree Star). We used the following definitions (all 
pre-gated on live, CD45+ cells): regulatory T cells, CD3+CD56–CD8–
CD4+FOXP3+; dendritic cells, CD3–CD56–CD19–CD14–CD11c+HLA–
DR+; monocytes, CD3–CD56–CD19–CD11b+CD14+; natural killer cells, 
CD3–CD56+; B cells, CD3–CD19+; CD8+ T cells, CD3+CD56–CD8+CD4–; 
CD4+ T cells, CD3+CD56–CD8–CD4+; natural killer T cells, CD3+CD56+. 
To identify frequencies of peripheral blood neutrophils, eosinophils 
and basophils, we measured respective cell frequencies by optical 
impedance on a clinical-grade Sysmex analyser.
T cell sorting
We sorted bulk T cells from patient PBMC samples immediately after 
thawing on a BD FACS Aria flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). We sorted 
CD107a– and CD107a+ CD8+ T cells after 7 days of peptide stimulation. 
We used the sorted T  cell samples for TCR Vβ sequencing, single-cell 
RNA/TCR sequencing, or single-cell TCR sequencing as indicated.
Single-cell RNA/TCR sequencing
Library preparations for single-cell immune profiling, sequencing and 
post-processing of the raw data were performed at the Epigenomics 
Core at Weill Cornell Medicine.
Sample preparation. Single-cell RNA sequencing libraries were pre -
pared according to 10x Genomics specifications (Chromium Single Cell 
V(D)J User Guide PN-1000006, 10x Genomics). Each cellular suspension 
(>90% viability), at a concentration between 700 and 1,000 cells per µl, 
was loaded onto to a 10x Genomics Chromium platform to generate 
Gel Beads-in-Emulsion (GEM), targeting about 10,000 single cells per sample. After GEM generation, polyA cDNA barcoded at the 5′ end by 
the addition of a template switch oligonucleotide (TSO) linked to a cell 
barcode and unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) was generated by 
incubation at 53 °C for 45 min in a C1000 Touch Thermal cycler with a 96-Deep Well Reaction module (Bio-Rad). GEMs were broken and the 
single-strand cDNA was cleaned up using DynaBeads MyOne Silane 
Beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The cDNA was amplified for 13 cycles 
(98 °C for 45 s; 98 °C for 20 s, 67 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 h). Quality and quantity of the cDNA was assessed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100, 
obtaining a product of about 1,600 bp. For generation of 5P expres -
sion libraries, an aliquot of the cDNA (about 50 ng) was enzymatically 
fragmented, end repaired, A-tailed, subjected to a double-sided size 
selection with SPRI select beads (Beckman Coulter) and ligated to adap -
tors provided in the kit. A unique sample index for each library was 
introduced through 14 cycles of PCR amplification using the indexes 
provided in the kit (98 °C for 45 s; 98 °C for 20 s, 54 °C for 30 s, and 
72 °C for 20 s × 14 cycles; 72 °C for 1 min; held at 4 °C). Indexed libraries 
were subjected to a second double-sided size selection, and libraries 
were then quantified using Qubit fluorometric quantification (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific). The quality was assessed on an Agilent Bioanalyzer 
2100, obtaining an average library size of 430 bp. For generation of 
full-length TCR VDJ regions, an aliquot of the cDNA (about 5 ng) was 
subjected to nested PCR amplification with specific VDJ outer and inner primer pairs (98 °C for 45 s; 98 °C for 20 s, 67 °C for 30 s, and 
72 °C for 20 s × 8 cycles; 72 °C for 1 min; held at 4 °C), and one-sided 
size selection using SPRI select beads. Quality and quantity of the VDJ 
region was assessed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. The average 
library size was 620 bp.
Sequencing and post-processing of data. 5P expression and TCR 
libraries were clustered on an Illumina NovaSeq pair-end read flow cell 
and sequenced for 28 cycles on R1 (10x barcode and the UMIs), followed 
by 8 cycles of I7 Index (sample Index), and 91 bases on R2 (transcript), obtaining about 250 million clusters for 5P expression and 50 million for TCR libraries. Primary processing of sequencing images was done using Illumina’s Real Time Analysis software (RTA). 10x Genomics Cell

single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-  
ranger was used to perform sample) was used for demultiplexing, align -
ment (hg19), filtering, UMI counting, single-cell 5′ end gene counting, 
TCR assembly, annotation of paired VDJ and performing quality control 
using the manufacturer’s parameters.
Analysis. Filtered gene expression matrices generated from 10x Cell -
Ranger for five samples were matched to paired TCR sequences using 
the python package Scirpy56. All five samples were aggregated into a 
single unnormalized counts matrix and all downstream analyses were 
performed using GeneVector57. Batch-effect correction was applied 
over all cells using the samples as batch labels. Cells were first clas -
sified as either CD4 or CD8 T cells using the respective gene marker. 
CD8+ T cells were further classified into four phenotypes (effector, 
memory, naive and dysfunctional) using previously published gene 
markers25,58. A probability distribution over phenotypes was gener -
ated for each cell, and phenotype assignment corresponded to the 
maximum probability. Vaccine-specific T cells were identified by exact  
match of the associated nucleotide sequence. Uniform manifold  
approximation and projection visualizations were constructed using 
the python library Scanpy59.
Clonality
Whole-exome sequence reads of tumour–normal paired samples of 
patients were aligned to the reference human genome (hg19) using 
the Burrows–Wheeler alignment tool (bwa mem v.0.7.17) and samtools 
(v.1.6). Duplicates were marked with picard-2.11.0 MarkDuplicates 
(http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard). Indel realignments were done 
using the Genome Analysis toolkit (GenomeAnalysisTK-3.8-1-0-gf -
15c1c3ef) RealignerTargetCreator and IndelRealigner60 using 1000 
genome phase1 indel (1000G_phase1.indels.b37.vcf) and Mills indel 
calls (Mills_and_1000G_gold_standard.indels.b37.vcf) as references. 
Base calls were recalibrated using BaseRecalibrator and dbSNP (v.138). 
Both tumour samples were covered at 378× and normal samples at 346× 
on average on its target regions.
MuTect 1.1.7 and Strelka 1.0.15 were used to call SNV and indels on 
pre-processed sequencing data. For the MuTect calls, dbSNP 138 and 
CosmicCodingMuts.vcf (v.86)61 were used as reference files. For the 
Strelka calls, we set “isSkipDepthFilters = 1” to prevent filtering-out 
of mutation calls from exome sequencing due to exome-sequencing 
mapping breadth. Unbiased normal and tumour read counts for 
each SNV and indel call were then assigned with the bam-readcount 
software 0.8.0-unstable-6-963acab-dirty (commit 963acab-dirty) (https://github.com/genome/bam-readcount ). A minimum base 
quality filter was set with the “-b 15” flag. The reads were counted in 
an insertion-centric way with the “-i” flag, so that reads overlapping 
with insertions were not included in the per-base read counts. We then 
used the normal and tumour read counts to filter mutations. The fol-
lowing filtering criteria were used: (1) total coverage for tumour ≥10; 
(2) variant allele frequency for tumour ≥2%; (3) number of reads with alternative allele ≥5 for tumour; (4) total coverage for normal ≥7; and 
(5) variant allele frequency for normal ≤1% at a given mutation. Filtered 
mutation sets were annotated using SnpEff (v.4.3t). 23 Dbsnp138 (b37) 
was used for snp-pileup.
To infer clonality of vaccine targets, we extracted missense and 
frameshift mutations from the filtered VCF files, and these muta -
tions were put into the PhyloWGS software package (https://github.
com/morrislab/phylowgs, v.1.0-rc2, branch: 681df79) along with copy number variant calls for phylogeny reconstruction. Among 10,000 trees from PhyloWGS, we took the top five trees based on 
the likelihood and computed the average entropy level to measure 
tumour heterogeneity. For a given tree, we computed exclusive clone  
frequencies such as∑ xX X =−αα
βD αβ
∈( )
where Dα() is the set of clones that are direct descendants of clone α in 
the given tree, and Xα is the cellular cancer fraction of clone α. Based 
on exclusive clone frequencies, we computed Shannon’s entropy as a 
measure of tumour heterogeneity as follows:
∑ Sx x =− log( )
αταα
τ∈
where ⟨.⟩τ is the arithmetic average operator from top five trees ( τ).
Neoantigen quality and vaccine response
To model neoantigen quality, we adapted our previously described 
model2,3 that identified spontaneously targeted neoantigens in tumours 
to identify immunogenic neoantigens for vaccination. Specifically, 
according to our model2,3 the immunogenicity (or quality) of a neo -
antigen is the product of two components. The first component—  
the non-self-recognition potential, R , of a neoantigen—is the inher -
ent immunogenicity of the neopeptide. The second component—the self-discrimination potential, D—models whether the cognate T cells 
of a neoantigen avoid negative thymic selection to therefore render 
neoantigen recognition less constrained by self-toleration.
Previous versions of our quality model2,3 estimated the non-self-  
recognition potential R  of a neopeptide using sequence homology (as 
determined by soft max rescaling of BLAST alignment) to the immu -
nogenic infectious disease-derived epitopes in the Immune Epitope 
Database (IEDB). Self-discrimination was estimated as a sum of two free 
discrimination energies between the neoantigen (MT) and its wild-type 
(WT) peptide, one for differential MHC presentation, the other for 
differential T cell cross reactivity:
DK
K=log +l ogEC
ECdWT
dMT50MT
50WT




where Kd is the HLA specific peptide–MHC affinity (as estimated by net-
MHC 3.4), and EC50 is the concentration for 50% activation for an avidity 
curve with the neopeptide and its cognate T cell clone2,3. Furthermore, 
in previous studies, we restricted our definition of minimal epitopes 
to consider to only 9-mers, the most common length of MHCI-bound 
peptides, predicted to bind to the HLA of the patient with a cut-off of 500 nM.
To now extend the notion of the cross-reactivity or epitope dis -
tance beyond the single substitution case as previously described2,3, 
we now made an independent site approximation by modelling the 
cross-reactivity distance, dC, between two 9-mer epitopes, pA and pB 
as follows:
∑ dp pd Mp
p(, )= ≈l ogEC ()
EC ()iip p CAB
=19
,50A
50B iiAB


where di is a scaling weight for position i  and M  is the substitution matrix 
as inferred from ref. 3 . This extension allowed us to replace the esti -
mation of the non-self-recognition potential R  of a neopeptide from 
sequence homology using BLAST with epitope distance.
We now took as our two components, in the context of vaccination, 
how far a neopeptide is from the germline and how close it is to known 
antigenic IEDB epitopes. For a given 9-mer minimal neoepitope, pMT we 
defined the quality of the 9-mer as follows:
Qp dp pd pp () =( ,) −m in (, )
pPMT
CMT WT
∈CMT a
a
IEDB
where PIEDB  is the collection of all 9-mers sequences and subsequences 
of IEDB epitopes.We defined the quality of a neopeptide as the average quality over 
the two highest quality 9-mer subsequences that include the substi -
tuted residue and are predicted binders (threshold of 4,000 nM) to 
the HLA type of the individual. As a vaccine can induce neoantigen 
expression in excess of endogenous expression in a tumour, we 
dropped the differential MHC presentation term and relaxed our MHC  
binding cut-off.
To determine whether neoantigen quality correlated with immu -
nogenicity of neoantigenic peptides included in the vaccines used 
in this study, we classified the neopeptides from the n  = 8 immune 
responders as derived from immunogenic or non-immunogenic neoan -
tigens according to the ELISpot assay. Individual immunogenicity was 
unable to be established for 7 out of the neoantigens from patient 25 
and were excluded from the analysis. We used neoantigens only from 
immune responders to ensure that lack of an immunological response 
to a neoantigen reflected non-immunogenicity and not general vaccine 
failure. This generated 23 immunogenic neoantigens out of a total of 99 
screened neoantigens from n = 8 immune responders. After excluding 
neoantigens with no predicted minimal epitope binders, we had a final 
cohort of 22 reactive neopeptides out of a total of 79.
Immunofluorescence
Automated double immunofluorescence was conducted using the 
Leica Bond BX staining system. Paraffin-embedded tissues were sec -
tioned at 5 µm and baked at 58 °C for 1 h. Slides were loaded in Leica 
Bond and staining was performed as follows. Samples were pretreated 
with EDTA-based epitope retrieval ER2 solution (Leica, AR9640) for 
20 min at 95 °C. The double antibody staining and detection were 
conducted sequentially. Primary antibodies against CD3 (0.6 µg ml–1, 
rabbit, Dako, A0452) and CD8 (1/10, rabbit, Ventana (Roche), 790-
4460) were used. The Leica Bond Polymer anti-rabbit HRP second -
ary antibody (Leica Biosystems, DS9800) was applied followed by 
Alexa Fluor tyramide signal amplification reagents (Life Technolo -
gies, B40953) or CF dye tyramide conjugates (Biotium, 92174) for 
detection. After CD3 staining, epitope retrieval was performed for 
denaturation of primary and secondary antibodies before CD8 anti -
body was applied. After the run was finished, slides were washed in 
PBS and incubated in 5 µg ml–1 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) 
(Sigma Aldrich) in PBS for 5 min, rinsed in PBS and mounted in Mowiol 
4–88 (Calbiochem). Slides were kept overnight at −20 °C before imag -
ing. Slides were scanned on a Panoramic scanner (3DHistech) using a 
×20/0.8 NA objective. Whole tissues were annotated in CaseViewer 
(3DHistech) and converted to Tiff images. ImageJ was used to segment 
cells based on DAPI and to quantify whether a given cell is single, double  
or null positive.
Humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2
We measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG antibody titres with a chemi-
luminescent microparticle immunoassay (AdviseDx SARS-CoV-2 IgG II 
assay; Abbott). In brief, we combined serum samples with paramagnetic 
particles coated with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 protein specific for the 
receptor-binding domain of the S1 protein, followed by incubation, 
washing and addition of a conjugate and chemiluminescent substrate. 
We then measured the resulting chemiluminescent reaction as a relative 
light unit, with a direct relationship between the amount of IgG antibod -
ies to SARS-CoV-2 in the sample and the relative light unit detected by 
the system optics (Architect i2000 analyzer). We used a 4 Parameter 
Logistic Curve fit data reduction method (4PLC, Y-weighted) to gener -
ate calibration, with a positivity cut-off of 50.0 AU ml–1.
Circulating tumour DNA
We measured circulating tumour DNA using MSK-ACCESS62, a high-  
depth next generation sequencing assay with molecular barcoding 
technology for the detection of very low frequency somatic alterations 
in 129 key cancer-associated genes within the plasma cell-free DNA Article(cfDNA) fraction in peripheral blood. In brief, cfDNA MSK-ACCESS 
raw sequence data were demultiplexed and processed as previously 
described62. cfDNA samples were sequenced to a median raw cover -
age of 25,465× (range 5,007×–49,869×); after collapsing, the median 
duplex coverage was 1,088× (range 187×–1,783×). Variant calling was 
performed in a matched tumour-informed manner (“genotyping”) 
using GetBaseCountMultiSample (https://github.com/msk-access/
GetBaseCountsMultiSample) and required at least 1 duplex consensus 
read or 2 simplex consensus reads, to call a somatic SNV or short indel 
at a site known to be altered in the matched tumour sample from a given 
patient, as previously described62.
Digital droplet PCR
DNA extraction. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) curls col-
lected in AutoLys M tubes (Thermo Fisher, A38738) were digested with 
protease solution. DNA was extracted using a MagMAX FFPE DNA/RNA 
Ultra kit (Thermo Fisher, A31881) on a KingFisher Flex purification 
system (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 
Samples were eluted in 55 µl elution solution.
Detection of TP53R175H mutation by digital droplet PCR. TP53  assays 
were ordered from Bio-Rad (assay identifiers dHsaCP2000105 for TP53 
p.R175H c.524G>A; dHsaCP2000106 for TP53 WT). Cycling conditions 
were tested to ensure optimal annealing and extension temperatures 
and optimal separation of positive from empty droplets. Optimization 
was done using a known positive control.
After PicoGreen quantification, 9 ng of gDNA was combined with 
locus-specific primers, FAM-labelled and HEX-labelled probes, HaeIII 
and digital PCR Supermix for probes (no dUTP). All reactions were per -
formed on a QX200 ddPCR system (Bio-Rad, 1864001), and each sample 
was evaluated in technical duplicates. Reactions were partitioned into 
a median of around 22,000 droplets per well using a QX200 droplet 
generator. Emulsified PCR assays were run on a 96-well thermal cycler 
using cycling conditions identified during the optimization step (95 °C 
for 10 min; 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 min and 55 °C for 1 min; 98 °C for 
10 min; 4 °C hold). Plates were read and analysed using QuantaSoft 
software to assess the number of droplets positive for mutant DNA, 
WT DNA, both or neither.
Statistical analyses
Safety end points are presented descriptively as percentages. Sam -
ple sizes (n) represent the number of patients, tumours, T cell clones 
or neoantigens. We analysed feasibility as the statistical equivalence 
between benchmarked and achieved treatment times. Here, we defined 
a delay of <1 week as the zone of clinical indifference and defined 
the achieved time to be statistically equivalent to the benchmarked 
time if the 90% confidence interval of the achieved time was within 
the zone of clinical indifference. We analysed survival curves using 
log-rank (Mantel Cox) test, compared two groups using unpaired 
two-tailed Mann–Whitney test and categorical variables using Chi square test. We compared longitudinal clonal expansion using 
two-tailed Fisher’s exact test, and in vitro clonal activation using bino -
mial test with Bonferroni correction. P < 0.05 was considered signifi -
cant. All analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (v.9.3.1) or  
Python (v.3.4).

contain immunodominant neoantigen-specific T cells.  (A, B ) Autogene 
cevumeran (vaccine) induced IFNγ production by ex vivo IFNγ ELISpot (assay schematic, Fig.  1e) and clonal expansion by CloneTrack (assay schematic,  
B, top ). Briefly, for ELISpot, we analyzed each patient’s PBMCs for specific T cells 
against all individual vaccine neoantigens post-atezolizumab/pre-vaccine, 1-3 weeks post-vaccine priming doses, and 5-6 weeks post-mFOLFIRINOX. Each patient’s PBMCs were stimulated overnight with separate pools of overlapping peptides (15 amino acids long), each pool representing one of up to 20 neoantigens in vaccines, or with anti-CD3 antibody as a positive control, followed by measurement of IFNγ production by ELISpot. PBMCs incubated 
with media alone were used as a negative control. To track T cell clones, we 
identified vaccine-expanded T cell clones with CloneTrack. To identify if expanded clones contained immunodominant neoantigen-specific clones,  
in 4 of 8 responders, we stimulated vaccine-expanded PBMCs collected 1-3 weeks post-vaccine priming doses in vitro with computationally predicted minimal neopeptide pools (8-14 amino acids long) from 6 neoantigens that generated the highest per-patient magnitude response by ex vivo IFNγ ELISpot. We then 
purified CD8
+ T cells that either expressed or did not express the degranulation 
marker CD107a, identified clones with greater proportion of CD107a+ versus 
CD107a- cells as in vitro neoepitope-activated clones, and examined overlap  
of in vitro neoepitope-activated to in vivo vaccine-expanded clones (Venn 
diagrams). For select patients, we further validated neoepitope-specificity by TCR cloning. (A ) Flow cytometry gating strategies. ( B) Ex vivo IFNγ ELISpot and

6 PBMCs for each immunogenic neoantigen in patients 10, 11 and 5. In patient 
5, one neoantigen induced a high magnitude T cell response, while patients 10 and 11 had polytopic high magnitude responses against 8 and 3 vaccine neoantigens respectively. Black lines = individual neoantigens; coloured lines = 
neoantigen pools. ( B, middle ): T cell clonal expansion in patients 10, 11 and  
5 by CloneTrack. Green line = trajectory of an individual expanded clone. 
Black line = geometric mean trajectory of all expanded clones; error bars = geometric standard deviation. Red line = cumulative percentage of all expanded clones. Black triangle = time of surgery; blue triangle = time of atezolizumab; green triangles = times of autogene cevumeran (vaccine);  
yellow bars = mFOLFIRINOX cycles. Dotted black line = detection threshold.  
(B, right ): In vitro neoantigen-specific activation. Flow cytometry = CD107a
