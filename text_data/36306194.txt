Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) present with advanced disease at diagnosis in up to 28% of cases, precluding the possibility of curative-intent surgery. Histopathological heterogeneity of this disease can be observed inter-individually as well as intra-individually during disease course. The present study aimed to assess the frequency of Ki-67 change after radical surgery, in a series of patients with radically resected entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (EP-NETs). We present the analysis of a multicenter, retrospective, series of EP-NETs G1-G2 recurring after radical resection and with histological re-evaluation at disease recurrence (DR). The primary endpoint was the description of Ki-67 change at DR compared to time of surgery. The secondary endpoint was assessment of recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates. In total, 47 patients had a second histological evaluation and could be included in the present study. Median Ki-67 at surgery was 3% (range 1-15%) but, at DR, a significant increase in the value was observed (7%, range 1-30%; p < .01) and involved 66.0% of cases, with a corresponding increase in tumor grading in 34.0% (p = .05). Median RFS of the overall population was 40 months, and was worse when Ki-67 increased at DR vs. stable Ki-67 value (36 vs. 61 months, respectively; p = .02). In conclusion, in more than half of the cases with relapse after radical surgery, a higher proliferative index with a potentially more aggressive potential was observed. Therefore, histological reassessment should be considered on DR because tailored therapeutic strategies may be required for these patients.
