Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has one of the highest mortality rates and requires the development of highly efficacious medications that can improve the efficiency of existing treatment methods. In particular, in PDAC, resistance to conventional chemotherapy reduces the effectiveness of anticancer drugs, decreasing the therapeutic efficiency. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), produced by sphingosine kinase (SK), plays a vital role in cancer growth, metastasis, chemotherapy, and drug resistance. Focusing on the structural characteristics of mebendazole (MBZ), we studied whether MBZ would affect metastasis, invasion, and drug resistance in cancer by lowering S1P production through inhibition of SK activity. MBZ selectively inhibited SK1 more than SK2 and regulated the levels of sphingolipids. MBZ inhibited the proliferation and migration of cancer cells in other PDAC cell lines. To determine whether the effect of MBZ on cancer cell growth and migration is S1P-mediated, S1P was treated, and the growth and migration of cancer cells were observed. It was found that MBZ inhibited S1P-induced cancer cell growth, and MBZ showed a growth inhibitory effect by regulating the JAK2/STAT3/Bcl-2 pathway. The phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a transcription factor that regulates migration, was inhibited by MBZ, so it was found that the effect of MBZ regulates the migration of cancer cells through the S1P/FAK/vimentin pathway. In conclusion, our study suggests that the anthelmintic MBZ can be used as a potential therapeutic agent for treating PDAC and for structural synthesis studies of its analogs.
