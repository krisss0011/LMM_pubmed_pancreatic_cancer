Background:Pancreatic cancer is the most lethal digestive cancer and the fourth overall cause of cancer death in the US. Asparagus, a widely consumed savory vegetable, is a rich source of antioxidants, saponins, vitamins, and minerals. In recent years, it has been shown that components of asparagus have anticancer effects on endometrial adenocarcinoma, and in prostate, breast, and colon cancer. In pancreatic cancer, it has been shown to have an anticancer effect on the KLM1-R cell line. This study was designed to investigate if asparagus extract (AE) had any effect on the growth of a widely used pancreatic cancer cell line MDAPanc-28 and to elucidate possible molecular mechanisms behind it.Materials and methods:Clonogenic survival assay, proliferation, and caspase-3 activity kits were used to evaluate the effects of AE on cell survival, proliferation, and apoptosis pathway of MDAPanc-28 cells. We further investigated the possible molecular mechanisms by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.Results:The colony numbers and proliferation of MDAPanc-28 cells were surprisingly increased when treated with AE. The relative caspase-3 activity in cancer cells decreased when they were treated with AE. The pro-proliferative effect of AE on MDAPanc-28 cells correlated with down-regulation of anti-proliferative molecules P21 and P53. The potential anti-apoptotic effect of AE correlated with down-regulation of the pro-apoptotic molecule Fas cell surface death receptor (FAS) and down-regulation of caspase-3 activity.Conclusion:AE exhibits a pro-tumor effect on MDAPanc-28 pancreatic cancer cells by down-regulation of P21, P53, and FAS.
