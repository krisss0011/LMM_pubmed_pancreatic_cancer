Objective:The aim of this study is to evaluate the utility of adjuvant radiotherapy (intraoperative radiotherapy, IORT; postoperative radiotherapy, PORT), and definitive radiotherapy for non-metastatic pancreatic cancer.Methods:Ninety-nine patients were analyzed. Thirty patients underwent IORT with surgery, 31 underwent PORT after surgery, and 38 underwent definitive radiotherapy. Tumor stage [Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) 2009] was as follows: Stage I, 7; IIA, 16; IIB, 31; III, 45. The doses for IORT, PORT, and definitive radio therapy were 20 to 30, 40 to 64.6, and 50.4 to 61.2 Gy, respectively. Associations between clinical parameters including age, gender, tumor site, stage, performance status, surgical margin, and use of chemotherapy and local control (LC) or overall survival (OS) were analyzed.Results:Follow-up periods for all patients were 1.1-145 months (median, 11). OS rate in the IORT, PORT, and definitive radiotherapy groups was 22%, 16%, and 6%, respectively, at 2 years. The 5-year OS rate was 13%, 3.2%, and 0%, respectively. Local control rate at 2 years was 33%, 35%, and 0%, respectively. No Grade â‰¥ 3 tox icities were observed. Distant metastasis was less common in the IORT group. Stage and surgical margin were sig nificant factors for OS after IORT. Performance status and chemotherapy were significant factors for OS after PORT and definitive radiotherapy.Conclusions:The present study showed the safety of the three treatment modalities, but the outcomes were not satisfactory. More intensive strategies including radiotherapy should be investigated.
