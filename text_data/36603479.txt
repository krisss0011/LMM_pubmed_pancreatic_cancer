Purpose:To compare the image quality and conspicuity of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) between the low-kVp and dual-energy pancreatic protocol CT reconstructed with deep-learning image reconstruction (DLIR).Method:A cohort of 111 consecutive patients (median age, 72 years; 56 men) undergoing a pancreatic protocol CT were retrospectively analyzed. Among them, 58 patients underwent 80-kVp CT (80-kVp group), and 53 patients underwent dual-energy CT and reconstructed at 40-keV (40-keV group). The medium-strength level of DLIR were used in both groups. Quantitative measurements, qualitative image quality, PDAC conspicuity, and dose-length product (DLP) were compared between the two groups using Mann-Whitney U test.Results:A total of 20 and 16 PDACs were found in the 80-kVp and 40-keV groups, respectively. CT numbers of the vasculatures and parenchymal organs (P <.001 for all) and the background noise at both pancreatic and portal venous phases (P <.001) were higher in the 40-keV group than in the 80-kVp group. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of all anatomical structures (P <.001-0.005), except for the liver in reviewer 2 (P =.47), and the tumor-to-pancreas contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR; P <.001-0.01) were higher in the 40-keV group than in the 80-kVp group. No difference was found in the image quality at both phases (P =.30-0.90). PDAC conspicuity was better in the 40-keV group than in the 80-kVp group (P =.007-0.03). DLP at pancreatic (275 vs. 313 mGy*cm; P =.05) and portal venous phases (743 vs. 766 mGy*cm; P =.20) was comparable between the two groups.Conclusion:Under the same DLP, virtual monoenergetic images at 40-keV demonstrated higher SNR and tumor-to-pancreas CNR and better PDAC conspicuity compared to the 80-kVp setting.
