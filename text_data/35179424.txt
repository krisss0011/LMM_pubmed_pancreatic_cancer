Objective:This study aimed to determine the factors associated with usage of home care, including palliative home care, in patients with pancreatic cancer in Ontario. In addition, this study attempted to investigate factors associated with early-onset palliative home care as well as the impact of home care services on survival and out-of-hospital death.Methods:The Ontario Cancer Registry (OCR) was used to identify and capture basic patient/cancer characteristics of index cases of pancreatic cancer diagnosed between April first, 2010 and March 31st, 2016. Patients that received home care were identified using the Home Care Database (HCD) and stratified into general, transition-to-palliative, and early-onset palliative home care. Logistic regressions were used to describe determinants of home care use and determinants of out-of-hospital death.Results:A total of 6888 pancreatic cancer patients met eligibility criteria for this study. A high proportion of patients (83.7%) received home care, including palliative home care (56.8%). In general, older patients (OR = 3.07) and those with more advanced malignancy (OR = 4.98) for stage 4 versus stage 1) had greater odds of receiving palliative home care. Patients receiving home care (P< .01) and those residing in rural regions (P< .01) had greater odds of out-of-hospital death.Conclusion:A large proportion of patients with pancreatic cancer are directed to home care and those that do are more likely to die outside of hospital. Age and stage at diagnosis are significant predictors of home care use. Differences exist in the healthcare experience of patients depending on if they receive home care services and the type of home care.
