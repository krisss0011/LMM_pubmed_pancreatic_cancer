Background:Situs inversus totalis (SIT) is a rare congenital condition characterized by complete transposition (right-to-left reversal) of the thoracic and abdominal organs. The estimated prevalence of SIT is 1 per 8000-25,000 live births [1]. Surgery for abdominal diseases in patients with SIT is technically demanding because of anatomical variations [2-4]; the importance of preoperative radiological assessment has been reported [4]. We report a case of SIT with complex vascular anomalies and pancreatic body cancer who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy with combined resection of the portal vein.Methods:A 79-year-old man with asymptomatic SIT was referred to our hospital for the treatment of pancreatic cancer that was incidentally found during a medical check-up. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a hypovascular tumor in the pancreatic body with a diameter of 32 mm involving the portal vein. He did not have SIT-associated diseases such as Kartagener syndrome or other malformations but had complex anomalies of vascular anatomy, especially in the hepatic arterial system, in addition to mirror-image transposition.Results:The operation was performed successfully with a full understanding of the vascular anatomy based on precise preoperative evaluation of CT images, including three-dimensional reconstruction images. The operative time was 710 min, and blood loss was 1237 mL. The Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) pathological stage was Stage III (T2, N2, M0).Conclusion:Pancreatoduodenectomy with portal vein resection for pancreatic cancer in patients with SIT is a complex procedure. Precise preoperative assessment of CT images with three-dimensional reconstruction is crucial to understanding vascular anatomy and safely performing surgery.
