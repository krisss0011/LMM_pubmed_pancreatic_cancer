In this issue of Cancer Cell, Kurz et al. demonstrate in an orthotopic pancreatic cancer model that low-intensity exercise improves tumor control and response to immunotherapy in an IL-15-dependent manner. Combination therapy, IL-15 super-agonist, anti-PD-1 antibody and chemotherapy, strongly reduces tumor growth. Therefore, the study opens rich translational avenues.
