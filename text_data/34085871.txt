Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a devastating disease. The standard first-line treatment for PDAC is gemcitabine chemotherapy which, unfortunately, offers only limited chance of a lasting cure. This review further evaluates the hypothesis that the effectiveness of gemcitabine can be improved by combining it with evidence-based complementary measures. Previously, supported by clinical trial data, we suggested that a number of dietary factors and nutraceuticals can be integrated with gemcitabine therapy. Here, we evaluate a further 10 agents for which no clinical trials have (yet) been carried out but there are promising data from in vivo and/or in vitro studies including experiments involving combined treatments with gemcitabine. Two groups of complementary agents are considered: Dietary factors (resveratrol, epigallocatechin gallate, vitamin B9, capsaicin, quercetin and sulforaphane) and nutraceutical agents (artemisinin, garcinol, thymoquinone and emodin). In addition, we identified seven promising agents for which there is currently only basic (mostly in vitro) data. Finally, as a special case of combination therapy, we highlighted synergistic drug combinations involving gemcitabine with "repurposed" aspirin or metformin. We conclude overall that integrated management of PDAC currently is likely to produce the best outcome for patients and for this a wide range of complementary measures is available.
