Objective:To evaluate safety and feasibility of laparoscopic ultrasonography (LUS)-guided cryoablation of locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC).Patients and methods:From April 2018 to December 2018, ten patients (five women, five men; mean age 58.2 ± 9.4 years) with LAPC underwent the operation. LUS was used to guide the cryoablation. Computed tomography (CT) imaging, biochemical analysis and pain score analysis by numeric rating scale (NRS) were used to assess treatment outcomes at 1 week and 3 months after the operation.Results:Cryoablation was performed by the operation in all cases. Seven patients received complete ablation and the success rate of operation was 70%. Two cryoablation cycles and an average of 1.4 ± 0.5 cryoprobes were used. The average freezing time and operation time were 23.8 ± 1.0 and 110.5 ± 24.7 min, respectively. The mean blood loss was 52.0 ± 16.6 ml. No major complications were observed after the operation. The mean maximum tumor diameter determined by CT decreased from 4.9 ± 0.7 cm before the operation to 4.7 ± 1.0 cm at 1 week and 4.6 ± 1.3 cm at 3 months, with P values of 0.53 and 0.51 (relative to the preoperative values), respectively. Postoperative CT imaging results suggested tumor necrosis in cryoablation-treated areas. The mean CA19-9 levels decreased from 347.5 ± 345.7 U/mL before operation to 190.4 ± 153.8 U/mL at 1 week and 182.7 ± 165.6 U/mL at 3 months, with P values of 0.15 and 0.14 (relative to the preoperative values), respectively. The average pain scores declined from 6.9 ± 1.1 before operation to 1.3 ± 1.2 at 1 week and 2.0 ± 0.8 at 3 months, with both P values of < 0.01 (relative to the preoperative values).Conclusion:This preliminary study suggested that LUS-assisted cryoablation was a safe and feasible treatment for LAPC.
