Market drugs, such as Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or European Medicines 
Agency (EMA)-approved drugs for specific indications provide opportunities for 
repurposing for newer therapeutics. This potentially saves resources invested in 
clinical trials that verify drug safety and tolerance in humans prior to 
alternative indication approval. Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) 
overexpression has been linked to promoting the tumor phenotype in several 
cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), colorectal cancer 
(CRC), and breast cancer (BC), making PRMT5 an important target for cancer 
therapy. Previously, we showed that PRMT5-mediated methylation of the nuclear 
factor (NF)-κB, partially contributes to its constitutive activation observed in 
cancers. In this study, we utilized an AlphaLISA-based high-throughput screening 
method adapted in our lab, and identified one FDA-approved drug, Candesartan 
cilexetil (Can, used in hypertension treatment) and one EMA-approved drug, 
Cloperastine hydrochloride (Clo, used in cough treatment) that had significant 
PRMT5-inhibitory activity, and their anti-tumor properties were validated using 
cancer phenotypic assays in vitro. Furthermore, PRMT5 selective inhibition of 
methyltransferase activity was confirmed by reduction of both NF-κB methylation 
and its subsequent activation upon drug treatment. Using in silico prediction, 
we identified critical residues on PRMT5 targeted by these drugs that may 
interfere with its enzymatic activity. Finally, Clo and Can treatment have 
exhibited marked reduction in tumor growth in vivo. Overall, we provide basis 
for pursuing repurposing Clo and Can as anti-PRMT5 cancer therapies. Our study 
offers potential safe and fast repurposing of previously unknown PRMT5 
inhibitors into clinical practice.
