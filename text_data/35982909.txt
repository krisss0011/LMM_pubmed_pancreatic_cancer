Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a devastating solid malignancy with a dismal prognosis. The treatment of metastatic PC is a current challenge for medical oncologists due to a lack of early detection, drug resistance, and relapse. Therefore, potential biomarkers and effective therapeutic targets for PC are urgently required. Ceramide-1-phosphate transfer protein (CPTP) is a member of the glycolipid transfer protein family, which is associated with autophagy and inflammation regulation. The roles and mechanisms ofCPTPin PC have not been clarified. In this study, by RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry analysis, we found thatCPTPis highly expressed in PC and is associated with a poor prognosis in PC patients. By using cell counting kit-8, colony formation, transwell and matrigel assaysin vitro, as well as xenograft model assaysin vivo, we further proved thatCPTPenhanced PC cells growth and metastasis. In PC cells, humanCPTPpromotes growth and metastasis via sphingolipid metabolite ceramide and PI4KA/AKT signaling. Sp (specific protein)-1 and Sp3 transcription factors also act as upstream positive regulators ofCPTPexpression in PC cells. Collectively, these findings suggested thatCPTPmay function as a pro-tumorigenic gene in PC cells and could be a promising therapeutic target in PC.
