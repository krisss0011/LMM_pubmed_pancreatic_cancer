Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most lethal human cancers. Currently, most PC cases are diagnosed at an already advanced stage. Early detection of PC is critical to improving survival rates. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify biomarkers for the early detection of PC. Recently, circulating miRNAs in whole blood and other body fluids have been reported as promising biomarkers for the early detection of various cancers, including PC. Furthermore, due to minimal invasiveness and technical availability, circulating miRNAs hold promise for further wide usage. As a potential novel molecular marker, circulating miRNAs not only represent promising noninvasive diagnostic and prognostic tools but could also improve the evaluation of tumor classification, metastasis, and curative effect. The purpose of this review is to outline the available information regarding circulating miRNAs as biomarkers for the early detection of PC.
