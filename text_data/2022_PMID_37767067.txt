INTRODUCTION: The actual rate of conversion surgery and its prognostic 
advantages remain unclear. This study aimed to assess the outcomes of salvage 
surgery after conversion therapy with triple therapy (transcatheter arterial 
chemoembolization [TACE] combined with lenvatinib plus anti-PD-1 antibodies) in 
patients with initially unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC).
METHODS: Patients with initially uHCC who received at least one cycle of 
first-line triple therapy and salvage surgery at five major cancer centers in 
China were included. The primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and 
recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates after salvage surgery. The secondary 
endpoints were perioperative complications, 90-day mortality, and pathological 
tumor response.
RESULTS: Between June 2018 and December 2021, 70 patients diagnosed with uHCC 
who underwent triple therapy and salvage surgery were analyzed: 39 with 
Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage C, 22 with BCLC stage B, and 9 with 
BCLC stage A disease. The median interval between the start of triple therapy 
and salvage surgery was 4.3 months (range, 1.7-14.2 months). Pathological 
complete response and major pathological response were observed in 29 (41.4%) 
and 59 (84.3%) patients, respectively. There were 2 cases of perioperative 
mortality (4.3%) and 5 cases of severe perioperative complications (7.1%). With 
a median follow-up of 12.9 months after surgery (range, 0.3-36.8 months), the 
median OS and RFS were not reached. The 1- and 2-year OS rates were 97.1% and 
94.4%, respectively, and the corresponding RFS rates were 68.9% and 54.4%, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: First-line combination of TACE, lenvatinib, and anti-PD-1 antibodies 
provides a better chance of conversion therapy in patients with initially uHCC. 
Furthermore, salvage surgery after conversion therapy is effective and safe and 
has the potential to provide excellent long-term survival benefits.
