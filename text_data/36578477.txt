Early and accurate diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer (PC) remain challenging endeavors globally. Late diagnosis lag, high invasiveness, chemical resistance, and poor prognosis are unresolved issues of PC. The concept of metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer cells. Increasing evidence shows that PC cells alter metabolic processes such as glucose, amino acids, and lipids metabolism and require continuous nutrition for survival, proliferation, and invasion. Glucose metabolism, in particular, regulates the tumour microenvironment (TME). Furthermore, the link between glucose metabolism and TME also plays an important role in the targeted therapy, chemoresistance, radiotherapy ineffectiveness, and immunosuppression of PC. Altered metabolism with the TME has emerged as a key mechanism regulating PC progression. This review shed light on the relationship between TME, glucose metabolism, and various aspects of PC. The findings of this study provide a new direction in the development of PC therapy targeting the metabolism of cancer cells.
