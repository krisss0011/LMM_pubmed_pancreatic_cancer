Pancreatic cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality and is projected to become the second-most common cause of cancer mortality in the next decade. While gene-wide association studies and next generation sequencing analyses have identified molecular patterns and transcriptome profiles with prognostic relevance, therapeutic opportunities remain limited. Among the genes that are upregulated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC), the leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a cytokine belonging to IL-6 family, has emerged as potential therapeutic candidate. LIF is aberrantly secreted by tumour cells and promotes tumour progression in pancreatic and other solid tumours through aberrant activation of the LIF receptor (LIFR) and downstream signalling that involves the JAK1/STAT3 pathway. Since there are no LIFR antagonists available for clinical use, we developed an in silico strategy to identify potential LIFR antagonists and drug repositioning with regard to LIFR antagonists. The results of these studies allowed the identification of mifepristone, a progesterone/glucocorticoid antagonist, clinically used in medical abortion, as a potent LIFR antagonist. Computational studies revealed that mifepristone binding partially overlapped the LIFR binding site. LIF and LIFR are expressed by human PDAC tissues and PDAC cell lines, including MIA-PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells. Exposure of these cell lines to mifepristone reverses cell proliferation, migration and epithelial mesenchymal transition induced by LIF in a concentration-dependent manner. Mifepristone inhibits LIFR signalling and reverses STAT3 phosphorylation induced by LIF. Together, these data support the repositioning of mifepristone as a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of PDAC.
