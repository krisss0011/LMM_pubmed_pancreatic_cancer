The tumor stroma of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by an abundant and heterogeneous population of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are critically involved in chemoresistance. However, the underlying mechanism of CAFs in chemoresistance is unclear. Here, we show that CAFR, a CAF subset derived from platinum-resistant PDAC patients, assumes an iCAF phenotype and produces more IL8 than CAFSisolated from platinum-sensitive PDAC patients. CAFR-derived IL8 promotes oxaliplatin chemoresistance in PDAC. Based on long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) profiling in tumor cells incubated with CAF-CM, we found that UPK1A-AS1, whose expression is directly induced by IL8/NF-kappa B signaling, functions as a chemoresistance-promoting lncRNA and is critical for active IL8-induced oxaliplatin resistance. Impressively, blocking the activation of UPK1A-AS1 expression increases the oxaliplatin sensitivity of tumor cells in vivo. Mechanistically, UPK1A-AS1 strengthens the interaction between Ku70 and Ku80 to facilitate nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), thereby enhancing DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. Clinically, UPK1A-AS1 expression is positively correlated with IL8 expression, a poor chemotherapeutic response and a shorter progression-free survival (PFS) time in advanced PDAC patients. Collectively, our study reveals a lncRNA-mediated mechanism of CAF-derived paracrine IL8-dependent oxaliplatin resistance and highlights UPK1A-AS1 as a potential therapeutic target.
