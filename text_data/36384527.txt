Background:Pancreatic signet ring cell carcinoma (PSRCC) is a rare tumour subtype with poorly understood epidemiological characteristics and prognosis. We attempted to comprehensively characterise the epidemiology and survival outcomes of PSRCC.Methods:Patients diagnosed with PSRCC between 2000 and 2018 were identified using Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Stat 8.3.9.2 software. Age-adjusted incidence and survival were calculated. Survival curves were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the differences between survival curves were compared using the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate factors that independently predict overall survival. The primary analysis was a complete case analysis; multiple imputations were employed in a sensitivity analysis.Results:We identified 585 eligible patients with PSRCC. The overall annual incidence from 2000 to 2018 was 0.349 (95% CI, 0.321-0.379) per million population. The incidence increased significantly in patients over 55 years of age and peaked at about 80 years of age (2.12 per million). Males and Black patients had the highest incidence. The observed survival rates at 1, 2 and 5 years were 20.1, 8.3 and 3.4%, respectively. Survival analysis revealed that primary surgery and chemotherapy are effective treatments for patients with PSRCC (P < 0.05). According to multivariate Cox regression analysis, early stage and receiving surgery and chemotherapy were favourable factors (P < 0.05). Similar conclusions were drawn from the interpolated data.Conclusions:PSRCC is a highly malignant tumour that predominates in elderly, male and Black patients. The prognosis is poor with a 5-year survival rate of 3.4%; however, multivariate analysis and adjusted models accounting for missing data revealed that early diagnosis, surgery and chemotherapy are effective in improving the prognosis.
