The presence of activated pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) in the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) microenvironment plays a significant role in cancer progression. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is overexpressed in PDAC tissues and expressed by both cancer and stromal cells. The pathophysiological role of MIF in PDAC-associated fibroblasts or PSCs is yet to be elucidated. Here we report that the PSCs of mouse or cancer-associated fibroblast cells (CAFs) of human expresses MIF and its receptors, whose expression gets upregulated upon LPS or TNF-Î± stimulation. In vitro functional experiments showed that MIF significantly conferred a survival advantage to CAFs/PSCs upon growth factor deprivation. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of MIF also corroborated these findings. Further, co-injection of mouse pancreatic cancer cells with PSCs isolated from Mif-/-or Mif+/+mice confirmed the pro-survival effect of MIF in PSCs and also demonstrated the pro-tumorigenic role of MIF expressed by CAFs in vivo. Differential gene expression analysis and in vitro mechanistic studies indicated that MIF expressed by activated CAFs/PSCs confers a survival advantage to these cells by suppression of interferon pathway induced p53 dependent apoptosis.
