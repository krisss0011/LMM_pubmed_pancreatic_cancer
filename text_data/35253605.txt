Anti-cancer effects of curcumol on various cancers have been reported previously. This study focused on investigating the role of curcumol in pancreatic cancer from the molecular perspective. The survival of pancreatic cancer patients with high or low expression of miR-21-5pand the target gene of miR-21-5pwere analyzed by bioinformatics. MiR-21-5p expression in cancer tissues was analyzed by RT-qPCR. Anxenograft-tumor BALB/c nude mice model was established and pancreatic cancer cells were cultured. Later, the mice and cells were further treated with curcumol. The tumor size and weightas well as mice body weight were recorded. The viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion of the cells were evaluated by MTT, colony formation, and transwell assays, respectively. The expressions of molecules in the xenograft-tumor tissues or cells were detected by immunohistochemical assay, Western blot, or RT-qPCR. MiR-21-5p was high-expressed in pancreatic cancer tissues and patients with high expression of miR-21-5p had poor survival. Curcumol inhibited the xenograft-tumor size, tumor weight, and PCNA and miR-21-5p expressions while promoting Cleaved caspase-3 expression in xenograft-tumor tissues. Curcumol inhibited the viability, proliferation, migration, invasion, and miR-21-5p expression, but increased SMAD7 expression in cancer cells. MiR-21-5p overexpression reversed the effect of curcumol on cancer cells, and decreased the E-cadherin expression while elevating the expressions of PCNA, N-cadherin, Vimentin, p-SMAD2, and p-SMAD3 in curcumol-treated cells. The overexpression of SMAD7, a target gene of miR-21-5p, reversed the effect of miR-21-5p on curcumol-treated cells. Curcumol inhibited growth of xenograft-tumors and the biological activities of pancreatic cancer cells by regulating the miR-21-5p/SMAD7 axis.
