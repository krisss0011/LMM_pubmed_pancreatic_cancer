Aim:Given the fact that tumor-associated macrophage-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) are attributable to tumor aggressiveness, this research intends to decode the mechanism of M2 macrophage-derived EVs in the differentiation and activities of pancreatic cancer (PaCa) stem cells via delivering microRNA (miR)-21-5p.Methods:Polarized M2 macrophages were induced, from which EVs were collected and identified. miR-21-5p expression in M2 macrophage-derived EVs was tested. After cell sorting, CD24+CD44+EpCAM+stem cells were co-cultured with M2 macrophages, in which miR-21-5p was upregulated or downregulated. The effects of M2 macrophage-derived EVs and miR-21-5p on Nanog/octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4) expression, sphere formation, colony formation, invasion and migration capacities, apoptosis, and in vivo tumorigenic ability were examined. Kr√ºppel-like factor 3 (KLF3) expression and its interaction with miR-21-5p were determined.Results:M2 macrophage-derived EVs promoted PaCa stem cell differentiation and activities. miR-21a-5p was upregulated in M2 macrophage-derived EVs. miR-21a-5p downregulation in M2 macrophage-derived EVs inhibited Nanog/Oct4 expression and impaired sphere-forming, colony-forming, invasion, migration, and anti-apoptosis abilities of PaCa stem cells in vitro and tumorigenic ability in vivo. miR-21-5p targeted KLF3 to mediate the differentiation and activities of PaCa stem cells, and KLF3 was downregulated in PaCa stem cells.Conclusion:This work explains that M2 macrophage-derived exosomal miR-21a-5p stimulates differentiation and activity of PaCa stem cells via targeting KLF3, paving a novel way for attenuating PaCa stemness.
