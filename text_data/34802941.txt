Background:The aim was to perform a propensity-matched comparison of patients with pancreatic cancer undergoing surgery, with and without biliary stenting and an intention to treat analysis of long-term survival between the two groups.Methods:This was an observational study of a cohort of consecutive patients presenting with obstructive jaundice and undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic and periampullary malignancies between November 2015 and May 2019.Results:In this study of 216 consecutive operable patients, 70 followed the fast-track pathway and 146 had pre-operative biliary drainage. All 70 patients in the FT group and 122 out of 146 in the PBD group proceeded to surgery (100% and 83.6% respectively, p = 0.001). Interval time from diagnostic CT scan to surgery and from MDT decision to treat to surgery was shorter in the FT group, (median 8 vs 43 days p < 0.001 and 3 vs 36 days p < 0.001 respectively) as was the overall time from diagnostic CT to adjuvant treatment (88 vs 121 days p < 0.001). Postoperative outcomes including complications, readmission and mortality rates were comparable in the two groups. There was no difference in survival.Conclusion:For a person with pancreatic cancer who is proceeding to surgery, the best approach is to avoid pre-operative biliary drainage.
