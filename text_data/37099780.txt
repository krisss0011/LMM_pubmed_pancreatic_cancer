Objectives:Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) cytology was one of the investigations for pancreatic masses. While the specificity approached 100%, its sensitivity remained low because of high rate of indeterminate and false-negative results. Meanwhile, KRAS gene was frequently mutated in up to 90% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and its precursor lesions. This study aimed to determine whether KRAS mutation analysis could improve the diagnostic sensitivity in EUS-FNA samples for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.Methods:The EUS-FNA samples from patients with a pancreatic mass obtained between January 2016 and December 2017 were reviewed retrospectively. The cytology results were classified as malignant, suspicious for malignancy, atypical, negative for malignancy, and nondiagnostic. KRAS mutation testing was performed using polymerase chain reaction followed by Sanger sequencing.Results:A total of 126 EUS-FNA specimens were reviewed. The overall sensitivity and specificity by cytology alone were 29% and 100%, respectively. When KRAS mutation testing was performed in cases with indeterminate and negative cytology, the sensitivity increased to 74.2%, and the specificity remained at 100%.Conclusions:KRAS mutation analysis, especially when performed in cytologically indeterminate cases, improves the diagnostic accuracy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. This may reduce the need to repeat invasive EUS-FNA for diagnosis.
