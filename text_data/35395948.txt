Pancreatic diseases, a serious threat to human health, have garnered considerable research interest, as they are associated with a high mortality rate. However, owing to the uncertain etiology and complex pathophysiology, the treatment of pancreatic diseases is a challenge for clinicians and researchers. Exosomes, carriers of intercellular communication signals, play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic diseases. Exosomes are involved in multiple stages of pancreatic disease development, including apoptosis, immune regulation, angiogenesis, cell migration, and cell proliferation. Thus, extensive alterations in the quantity and variety of exosomes may be indicative of abnormal biological behaviors of pancreatic cells. This phenomenon could be exploited for the development of exosomes as a new biomarker or target of new treatment strategies. Several studies have demonstrated the diagnostic and therapeutic effects of exosomes in cancer and inflammatory pancreatic diseases. Herein, we introduce the roles of exosomes in the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic diseases and discuss directions for future research and perspectives of their applications.
