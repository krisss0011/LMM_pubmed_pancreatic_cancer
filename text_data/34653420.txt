Background and aims:Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is reversible; however, the effect of changes in MetS status on pancreatic cancer risk is unknown. We aimed to investigate the effects of changes and persistence in MetS status on pancreatic cancer risk.Methods:This nationwide cohort study included 8,203,492 adults without cancer who underwent 2 consecutive biennial health screenings provided by the Korean National Health Insurance System between 2009 and 2012 and were followed up until 2017. MetS was defined as the presence of 3 of its 5 components, which were evaluated at 2 consecutive biennial health screenings. Participants were categorized into the MetS-free, MetS-recovered, MetS-developed, or MetS-persistent group. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used.Results:During the 40,464,586 person-years of follow-up (median, 5.1 years), 8010 individuals developed pancreatic cancer. Compared with the MetS-free group, the MetS-persistent group had the highest risk of pancreatic cancer (hazard ratio [HR], 1.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23-1.37), followed by the MetS-developed group (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.09-1.25) and the MetS-recovered group (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.04-1.21) after adjusting for potential confounders (P for trend <.001). The MetS-recovered group was associated with a lower risk of pancreatic cancer than that in the MetS-persistent group (P < .001). The association between changes in MetS status and pancreatic cancer risk did not differ according to sex or obesity (all P for interactions >.05).Conclusions:In this study, recovering from MetS was associated with a reduced risk of pancreatic cancer compared with persistent MetS, suggesting that pancreatic cancer risk can be altered by changes in MetS.
