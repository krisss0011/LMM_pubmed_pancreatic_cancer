Backgroud:Among digestive tract tumors, pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) has a high degree of malignancy. Therefore, it is important to search for pancreatic adenocarcinoma-related differential genes and new oncogene therapeutic targets for early diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.Aims:This study aims to investigate the expression and clinical significance of Family with sequence similarity 111 member B (FAM111B) in PAAD.Materials & methods:Bioinformatics was used to analyze the relationship between FAM111B expression and pancreatic adenocarcinoma and to predict its role in related pathways. Tissue microarrays were used to assess the levels of FAM111B in pancreatic cancer tissues by immunohistochemical staining, and the effects of FAM111B expression levels on apoptosis, proliferation, invasion and migration of tumor cells were observed and verified by in vitro cellular assays.Results:FAM111B expression was higher in PAAD tissue than in matched normal tissues (p < 0.05). The expression level of FAM111B, the metastatic status of lymph nodes was an independent prognostic factor for PAAD survival (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, overexpression of FAM111B promoted PAAD cell proliferation, migration, invasion and inhibited PAAD cell apoptosis (p < 0.05). In contrast, knockdown of FAM111B triggered the opposite result (p < 0.05). In the results of GSEA, it was shown that FAM111B may be involved in PAAD progression through p53 signaling pathway, cell cycle, and other signaling pathways (p < 0.05 and FDR q-val <0.25). FAM111B is highly expressed in PAAD tissues and is closely associated with poor prognosis of PAAD.Conclusion:FAM111B significantly promotes the proliferation, invasion, and migration of pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells while it inhibits their apoptosis. FAM111B may be a new biomarker for PAAD. It may provide a new direction for the treatment and diagnosis of PAAD.
