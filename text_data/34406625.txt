Background:Pretherapy serum neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR) have been shown to predict prognosis in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, the published literature is conflicting; hence, we aimed to evaluate their role in predicting survival outcomes in operated patients of PDAC.Methods:A retrospective analysis was performed in all operated cases of PDAC who underwent curative resection between 2011 and 2018. The pretherapy NLR, PLR, and LMR were calculated and analyzed with respect to pathological and survival outcomes RESULTS: One hundred thirty-four operated patients were included. The median overall survival for NLR of less than 2, 2.7, and 5 was 30.8, 27.2, and 27.5 months and for NLR of more than 2, 2.7, and 5 was 22.9, 21.6, and 21.5 months, respectively, and was statistically insignificant (p-value-0.32, 0.91, 0.34, respectively). Similarly, the PLR was not significant for a cutoff of 150 (p-value-0.27), and LMR was not significant for a cutoff of 2.8 (p-value-0.13) and 4.8 (p-value-0.11). On univariate analysis age, CA 19-9 levels, perineural invasion, margin positivity, lymph node positivity, and TNM stage were found to have a significant correlation with overall survival. However, on multivariate analysis, only TNM stage was found to be significant.Conclusion:The NLR, PLR, and LMR do not correlate with overall survival in operated patients with PDAC in this study. A combination of inflammatory markers or their dynamic testing might probably achieve prognostic significance.
