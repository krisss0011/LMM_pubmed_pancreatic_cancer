Purpose:Pancreatic cancer is the seventh leading cause of cancer death in cases. The study was conducted to determine the epidemiologic and pathologic of pancreatic cancer METHODS: A case series study was conducted retrospectively at Beheshti Hospital in Hamadan, Iran. A total of 409 cases that had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer from 2008 to 2018 were reviewed. The variables included age, gender, occupation, pathological type, location involved, early symptoms, metastasis status, prognosis, and treatments were extracted from the files and recorded in checklist. Data were analyzed by using SPSS/20 software.Results:Pancreatic cancer has been increasing trend in terms of time (2008-2018). Pancreatic cancer was most common age in the sixth decade of life and is more common in men than women. There was a significant relationship between aging and the incidence of pancreatic cancers (P < 0.05). Most of the subjects were urban (50.4%). The frequencies of smoking, alcohol, and drugs were 34.5, 15.6, and 14.0%, respectively. Also, there was no statistically significant relationship between smoking, alcohol, and drugs and pancreatic cancer (P > 0.05). The frequency of pancreatic cancers included adenocarcinomas (66.7%), unknown (25.2%), mucinous adenocarcinomas (4.2%), and carcinoma (3.9%), respectively.Conclusion:Pancreatic cancer has been increasing trend in terms of time. Pancreatic cancer was most common age in the sixth decade of life and is more common in men than women. The most common type of pancreatic cancer was adenocarcinoma. Diagnosis usually occurs at higher stages. More preventive considerations were found to be beneficial among this population.
