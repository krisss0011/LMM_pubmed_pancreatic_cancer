Chronic pancreatitis (CP), a fibroinflammatory disease, is a potential risk factor for pancreatic cancer. This study attempted to identify and analyze the key genes involved in CP development and their association with pancreatic cancer. The GSE41418 dataset was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses were performed on common differentially expressed genes. A protein-protein interaction network was constructed by using the STRING database. The expression and prognostic value of hub genes in pancreatic cancer were analyzed by Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) and UALCAN databases. The results showed that the upregulated genes primarily focused on the cell cycle, DNA replication, and phagosome activity. The PPI network was composed of 184 nodes and 925 edges. The 10 hub genes were screened by CytoHubba, of which CCNB2, CDC6, CDK1 and CKS2 were observed to be differentially expressed in pancreatic cancer with CP, and all of them were detrimental to overall survival and recurrence-free survival of pancreatic cancer. In this study, we employed bioinformatic analysis to determine that CCNB2, CDC6, CDK1 and CKS2 may be key genes in the development of CP and pancreatic cancer.
