Aims:The main objective of this study was to determine the sensitivity of abdominal ultrasonography (US) in patients with isoattenuating pancreatic carcinoma and to compare the frequency of secondary signs on abdominal US and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) in these tumours.Methods:Twenty-four patients with histologically or cytologically verified isoattenuating pancreatic carcinoma who underwent abdominal US, contrast-enhanced CT and EUS of the pancreas as part of the diagnostic workup were included in this retrospective study. The sensitivity of abdominal US in detecting the isoattenuating pancreatic carcinoma was investigated and the frequency of secondary signs of isoattenuating pancreatic carcinoma on abdominal US and EUS was compared.Results:In 5 of 24 patients (21%) with isoattenuating pancreatic carcinoma, a hypoechogenic pancreatic lesion was directly visualised on abdominal US. Secondary signs were present on US in 21 patients (88%). These included dilatation of the common bile duct and/or intrahepatic bile ducts in 19/24 (79%), dilatation of the pancreatic duct in 3/24 (13%), abnormal contour/inhomogeneity of the pancreas in 1/24 (4%), and atrophy of the distal parenchyma in 1/24 (4%). Pancreatic duct dilatation was observed more frequently on EUS than on abdominal US (P=0.002). For other secondary signs, there was no significant difference in their detection on abdominal US and EUS (P=0.61-1.00).Conclusion:Abdominal US is capable of detecting secondary signs of isoattenuating pancreatic carcinoma with high sensitivity and has the potential to directly visualise these tumours.
