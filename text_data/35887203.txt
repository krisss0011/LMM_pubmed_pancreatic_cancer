As pancreatic cancer is the third deadliest cancer in the U.S., the ability to study genetic alterations is necessary to provide further insight into potentially targetable regions for cancer treatment. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) represent an especially aggressive subset of cancer cells, capable of causing metastasis and progressing the disease. Here, we present the Labyrinth-DEPArray pipeline for the isolation and analysis of single CTCs. Established cell lines, patient-derived CTC cell lines and freshly isolated CTCs were recovered and sequenced to reveal single-cell copy number variations (CNVs). The resulting CNV profiles of established cell lines showed concordance with previously reported data and highlight several gains and losses of cancer-related genes such as FGFR3 and GNAS. The novel sequencing of patient-derived CTC cell lines showed gains in chromosome 8q, 10q and 17q across both CTC cell lines. The pipeline was used to process and isolate single cells from a metastatic pancreatic cancer patient revealing a gain of chromosome 1q and a loss of chromosome 5q. Overall, the Labyrinth-DEPArray pipeline offers a validated workflow combining the benefits of antigen-free CTC isolation with single cell genomic analysis.
