Background:Socioeconomic status (SES) is an important factor affecting access to cancer care and survival. Its role in pancreatic cancer warrants scrutiny.Methods:A systematic review of major reference databases was undertaken. Categorization of the study population into low SES (LSES) and high SES (HSES) was based on the criteria employed in the individual studies. The outcome measures studied were stage of cancer presentation, access to care and overall survival. Meta-analysis was performed using random-effects models and trial sequential analysis (TSA) was used to assess the precision and conclusiveness of the results.Results:Thirteen studies meeting inclusion criteria were included in the meta-analysis, which demonstrated that LSES was associated with significantly lower rates of presentation at a non-metastatic stage and poorer access to cancer care, viz. surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Despite heterogeneity, TSA supported the findings, displaying minimal type I error.Conclusion:As LSES is associated with delayed presentation, poorer access to care and poorer survival, SES should be considered a modifiable risk factor for poor outcomes in pancreatic cancer.
