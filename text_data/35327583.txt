Background:Collagen type XI α1 (COL11A1) is associated with tumorigenesis and development in many human malignancies. Previous reports indicate that COL11A1 may be a significant diagnostic marker for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC); however, its biological role in PDAC progression remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the influence of COL11A1 on the invasion and migration abilities of pancreatic cancer cells and explored its potential molecular mechanisms.Methods:Cell migration and invasion were assessed using Transwell assays in pancreatic cancer cells transfected with siCOL11A1 and pCNV3-COL11A1 plasmids. The protein and mRNA expression levels of N-cadherin, E-cadherin, Vimentin, cluster of differentiation (CD)-24, CD44, serine-threonine kinase (AKT), glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β, phospho (p)-AKTSer473, p-GSK-3βSer9, and Snail were analyzed using Western blotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The effect of COL11A1 on cell stemness was tested using flow cytometry and clone formation assays.Results:These results demonstrated that COL11A1 significantly promoted the invasion and migration abilities of PDAC cells. Furthermore, COL11A1 facilitated the occurrence of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell stemness by upregulating the expression levels of p-AKTSer473, p-GSK-3βSer9, and Snail.Conclusions:This study suggests that the activation of the AKT/GSK-3β/Snail signaling pathway induced by COL11A1 plays a major role in the progression of PDAC. Therefore, COL11A1 could serve as a potential target for PDAC treatment.
