Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a life-threatening cancer with increasing incidence in developed countries. Reports indicate that tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) are possible therapeutic targets and biomarkers for cancer treatment. Nonetheless, the effect of tRF-Leu-AAG on PC is unclear. This study aims to explore the role of tRF-Leu-AAG and upstream frameshift mutant 1 (UPF1) in the development of PC and its potential underlying mechanisms. High-throughput second-generation sequencing techniques were used to detect the expression of tRFs in cancerous and adjacent normal tissues from PC patients. The role of tRF-Leu-AAG proliferation in PC cells was investigated via the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay. The effect of tRF-Leu-AAG on the invasion and migration ability of PC cells was also determined by the transwell assay. Thereafter, the downstream target genes of tRF-Leu-AAG were comprehensively predicted using bioinformatics analysis databases. We also used the Dual-Luciferase Reporter assay to assess the nexus between tRF-Leu-AAG and UPF1. Eventually, Western Blot was used to validate the expression of UPF1 in PC cells. A total of 33 tRF expressions significantly varied from PC patients. RT-qPCR confirmed that the expression of tRF-Leu-AAG was observably up-regulated in PC cells as compared to the control cells. Importantly, knockdown of tRF-Leu-AAG observably inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, according to the predicted frameshift database results, the UPF1 acted as downstream target genes for tRF-Leu-AAG and significantly down-regulated UPF1 expression.
