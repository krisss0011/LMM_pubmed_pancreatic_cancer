Objectives:Current guidelines limit pancreatic cancer screening to those BRCA1/2 patients who have a family history of pancreatic cancer. We aimed to assess the association between family history and risk of pancreatic neoplasms in BRCA1/2 patients.Methods:We reviewed medical records of BRCA1/2 patients followed at our institution between 1995 and 2020. Family history was defined as those with a first-degree relative with pancreatic cancer. We compared the incidence and prevalence of pancreatic neoplasms between patients with and without family history of pancreatic cancer.Results:We identified 56 BRCA1/2 patients with family history and 238 without family history of pancreatic cancer. No difference between these groups was noted in age, race, or sex. Mean follow-up interval for BRCA1/2 patients was 4.6 years (range, 0-19.7 years). There was no significant difference in prevalence (19.6% vs 12.6; P = 0.3) or incidence (29% vs 14.1%; P = 0.08) of branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm between the 2 groups. No association between family history and pancreatic cancer risk was noted. Only 1 of 10 BRCA1/2 patients with pancreatic cancer had a family history.Conclusions:Our results do not support using family history to determine eligibility for pancreatic cancer screening.
