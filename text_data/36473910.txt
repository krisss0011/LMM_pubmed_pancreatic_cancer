This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a novel fully covered self-expandable metal stent (SEMS) with dumbbell-shaped flare ends for the palliation of distal biliary obstruction (DBO) due to unresectable pancreatic cancer (UPC). Patients with DBO due to UPC who received the novel HILZO fully covered stent (HFS), the WALLFLEX partially covered stent (WPS) or fully covered stent (WFS) were analyzed. The incidence of recurrent biliary obstruction (RBO), time to RBO (TRBO), and the incidence of complications were compared among the three SEMS groups. Eighty-four patients (HFS, n = 36; WPS, n = 20; WFS, n = 28) were included. The incidence of RBO was low in the HFS group (versus the WPS and WFS group, p = 0.033 and 0.023, respectively). TRBO in the HFS group was longer than that in the WFS group (p = 0.049). Placement of the HFS was an independent factor for long TRBO in multivariable analysis (p = 0.040). The incidence of pancreatitis and cholecystitis in the HFS group was low (one for each). It is recommended to use the HFS for the palliation of DBO due to UPC from the viewpoint of the low incidence of RBO and complications.
