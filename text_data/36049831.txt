Identification of deleterious germline mutations in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients can have therapeutic implications for the patients and result in cascade testing and prevention in their relatives. Universal testing for germline mutations is now considered standard of care in patients with PDAC, regardless of family history, personal history, or age. Here, we highlight the commonly identified germline mutations in PDAC patients as well as the impact of multigene panel testing. We further discuss therapeutic implications of germline testing on the index cases, and the impact of cascade testing on cancer early detection and prevention in relatives.
