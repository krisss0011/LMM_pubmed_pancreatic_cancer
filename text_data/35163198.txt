Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common and aggressive type of pancreatic cancer (PCa) with a low survival rate. microRNAs (miRs) are endogenous, non-coding RNAs that moderate numerous biological processes. miRs have been associated with the chemoresistance and metastasis of PDAC and the presence of a subpopulation of highly plastic "stem"-like cells within the tumor, known as cancer stem cells (CSCs). In this study, we investigated the role of miR-21, which is highly expressed in Panc-1 and MiaPaCa-2 PDAC cells in association with CSCs. Following miR-21 knockouts (KO) from both MiaPaCa-2 and Panc-1 cell lines, reversed expressions of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and CSCs markers were observed. The expression patterns of key CSC markers, including CD44, CD133, CX-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), and aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 (ALDH1), were changed depending on miR-21 status. miR-21 (KO) suppressed cellular invasion of Panc-1 and MiaPaCa-2 cells, as well as the cellular proliferation of MiaPaCa-2 cells. Our data suggest that miR-21 is involved in the stemness of PDAC cells, may play roles in mesenchymal transition, and that miR-21 poses as a novel, functional biomarker for PDAC aggressiveness.
