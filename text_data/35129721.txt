Background:Patients with borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (BRPC) or locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) are at high risk of margin-positive resection. Neoadjuvant stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) may help sterilize margins, but its additive benefit beyond neoadjuvant chemotherapy (nCT) is unclear. The authors report long-term outcomes for BRPC/LAPC patients explored after treatment with either nCT alone or nCT followed by five-fraction SBRT (nCT-SBRT).Methods:Patients with BRPC or LAPC from 2011 to 2016 who underwent resection after nCT alone or nCT-SBRT were retrospectively reviewed. Baseline characteristics were compared, and the propensity score with inverse probability weighting (IPW) was used to compare pathologic/survival outcomes.Results:Of 198 patients, 76 received nCT, and 122 received nCT-SBRT. The nCT-SBRT cohort had a higher proportion of LAPC (53% vs 22%; p < 0.001). The duration of nCT was longer for nCT-SBRT (4.6 vs 2.9 months; p = 0.03), but adjuvant chemotherapy was less frequently administered (53% vs 67.1%; p < 0.001). Adjuvant radiation was administered to 30% of the nCT patients. The nCT-SBRT regimen more frequently achieved negative margins (92% vs 70%; p < 0.001), negative nodes (59% vs 42%; p < 0.001), and pathologic complete response (7% vs 0%; p = 0.02). In the multivariate analysis, nCT-SBRT remained associated with R0 resection (p < 0.001). The nCT-SBRT cohort experienced no significant difference in median overall survival (OS) (22.1 vs 24.5 months), local progression-free survival (LPFS) (13.5 vs. 15.4 months), or distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) (11.7 vs 16.3 months) after surgery. After SBRT, 1-year OS was 77.0% and 2-year OS was 50.4%. Perioperative Claven-Dindo grade 3 or greater morbidity did not differ significantly between the nCT and nCT-SBRT cohorts (p = 0.81).Conclusions:Despite having more advanced disease, the nCT-SBRT cohort was still more likely to undergo an R0 resection and experienced similar survival outcomes compared with the nCT alone cohort.
