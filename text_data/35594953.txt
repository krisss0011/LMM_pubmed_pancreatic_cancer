Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a highly lethal malignant gastrointestinal tumor. Sparstolonin B is an isocoumarin whose anticancer activity has recently received increasing attention. This study aimed to investigate Sparstolonin B's potential antitumor effect on pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The effect of Sparstolonin B on pancreatic cancer target genes and molecular mechanism was predicted via network pharmacology; Sparstolonin B significantly decreased Panc-1 and SW1990 cell viability and effectively suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells as shown by CCK-8, colony formation, and Transwell assays. Flow cytometry showed that it induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Sparstolonin B also upregulated Bax levels but decreased those of MMP2 and Bcl-2, downregulated IκBα expression, and upregulated p65 and IκBα phosphorylation; however, it had no effect on total NF-κB p65 levels. The NF-κB pathway inhibitor QNZ reversed these effects. The treatment group (26 μmol/L) had reduced graft volume and weight and fewer Ki-67-positive cells than the control group. Therefore, Sparstolonin B can inhibit the growth and induce the apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells via the NF-κB signaling pathway and may be a potential novel drug for pancreatic cancer treatment.
