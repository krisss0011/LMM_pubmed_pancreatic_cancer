Background:Piceatannol is a naturally occurring plant-derived phenolic compound (stilbenoid), an analogue of resveratrol. It has been shown that, piceatannol has biological activity properties such as antiproliferative, antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and proapoptotic, in various human cancer studies in vitro and in vivo.Objectives and methods:In this study, it was aimed to investigate whether piceatannol induces apoptosis through anticancer activity methods (cell viability, colony formation, annexin-V/7-AAD, ROS (Reactive oxygen species), MMP (Mitochondrial membrane potential), wound healing, invasion assay, RT-qPCR (Real-Time Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction), western blotting in PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer (PC) cell lines.Results:According to our results, piceatannol decreased cell viability in a dose and time-dependent manner [the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50): 60 µM in PANC-1 and IC50: 90 µM in MIA PaCa-2 cell line at 48 h (h)] and caused significant changes in the expression of apoptosis-related genes and protein. Piceatannol induced apoptosis in PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells, accompanied by increased ROS production, decreased MMP, and increased Caspase-3-9 activity. Piceatannol also inhibited colony-forming abilities, invasion, and migration of PC cells.Conclusion:Our results show that piceatannol has an anti-cancerogenic effect on PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells, and exerts this effect by suppressing proliferation and inducing apoptosis. Therefore, piceatannol could be considered to be a potential chemotherapeutic agent candidate for the treatment and prevention of PC.
