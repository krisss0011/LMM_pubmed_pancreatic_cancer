The energy metabolism of tumor cells is considered one of the hallmarks of cancer because it is different from normal cells and mainly consists of aerobic glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and glutaminolysis. It is about one hundred years ago since Warburg observed that cancer cells prefer aerobic glycolysis even in normoxic conditions, favoring their high proliferation rate. A pivotal enzyme driving this phenomenon is lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and this review describes prognostic and therapeutic opportunities associated with this enzyme, focussing on tumors with limited therapeutic strategies and life expectancy (i.e., pancreatic and thoracic cancers). Expression levels of LDH-A in pancreatic cancer tissues correlate with clinicopathological features: LDH-A is overexpressed during pancreatic carcinogenesis and showed significantly higher expression in more aggressive tumors. Similarly, LDH levels are a marker of negative prognosis in patients with both adenocarcinoma or squamous cell lung carcinoma, as well as in malignant pleural mesothelioma. Additionally, serum LDH levels may play a key role in the clinical management of these diseases because they are associated with tissue damage induced by tumor burden. Lastly, we discuss the promising results of strategies targeting LDH as a treatment strategy, reporting recent preclinical and translational studies supporting the use of LDH-inhibitors in combinations with current/novel chemotherapeutics that can synergistically target the oxygenated cells present in the tumor.
