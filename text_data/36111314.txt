Introduction:The realization of MRI contrast agents through chemical protocols of functionalization is a strong domain of research. In this work, we developed and formulated a novel hybrid gold nanoparticle system in which a gold salt (HAuCl4) is combined with dotarem, an MRI contrast agent (DOTA) by chelation (Method IN) and stabilized by a lactose-modified chitosan polymer (CTL; Chitlac) to form DOTA IN-CTL AuNPs.Result and discussion:The authors demonstrate the biological efficiency of these nanoparticles in the case of three cell lines: Mia PaCa-2 (human pancreatic cancer cell line), TIB-75 (murine liver cell line) and KKU-M213 (cholangiocarcinoma cell line). DOTA IN-CTL AuNPs are stable under physiological conditions, are nontoxic, and are very efficient as PTT agents. The highlights, such as high stability and preliminary MRI in vitro and in vivo models, may be suitable for diagnosis and therapy.Conclusion:We proved that DOTA IN-CTL AuNPs have several advantages: i) Biological efficacy on three cell lines: MIA PaCa-2 (human pancreatic cancer cell line), TIB-75 (murine liver cell line) and KKU-M213 (cholangiocarcinoma cell line); ii) high stability, and no-toxicity; iii) high efficiency as a PPT agent. The study conducted on MRI in vitro and in vivo models will be suitable for diagnosis and therapy.
