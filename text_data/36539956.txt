Limited data exist on the management of patients with locally advanced (aPC) or metastatic pancreatic (mPC) cancer who achieve stable disease/response after first-line chemotherapy. In this setting, maintenance therapy is important to minimize toxicity while preserving survival benefits. The aim of this study is to conduct a narrative review of the evidence available on the topic and present the results of a retrospective case series of patients with aPC or mPC who received maintenance therapy following a good response to induction chemotherapy. Olaparib is the only drug approved for maintenance therapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer and germline Breast Cancer gene mutation. Data from several trials, including the phase II PANOPTIMOX-PRODIGE35 trial, showed clinical benefit from the use of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) as maintenance. We also conducted a case series including 12 patients who received FOLFIRINOX as induction chemotherapy for aPC or mPC followed by fluorouracil (5-FU) or FOLFIRI maintenance therapy. Median progression-free survival is 22.13 months which is higher than that reported in the literature, which ranges between 5 and 10.6 months. Although further conclusions cannot be drawn because of the small sample size, the results are promising and encourage further exploration of this topic in larger prospective trials.
