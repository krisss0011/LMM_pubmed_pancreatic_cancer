Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal malignancies because of its high invasiveness and metastatic potential. Computed tomography (CT) is often used as a preliminary diagnostic tool for pancreatic cancer, and it is increasingly used to predict treatment response and disease stage. Recently, a study published inWorld Journal of Gastroenterologyreported that quantitative analysis of preoperative enhanced CT data can be used to predict postoperative overall survival in patients with PDAC. A tumor relative enhancement ratio of â‰¤ 0.7 indicates a higher tumor stage and poor prognosis.
