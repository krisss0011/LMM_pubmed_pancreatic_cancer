Pancreatic diseases, such as pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, remain the most threatening gastrointestinal diseases with a high mortality due to atypical symptoms. MicroRNA plays crucial roles in regulating metastasis and cell proliferation of pancreatic cancer, constituting important biomarkers for the early diagnosis of pancreatic cancers. Herein, we develop a sensitive and simple exosomal miRNA detection method with only a dual-hairpin-probe. In detail, the dual-hairpin-probe is constructed through combination of two functional sections for both target miRNA identification and signal amplification. With only one probe, the method possesses the capability to avoid interferences from concentration changes of other probes, and exhibits a higher stability which is demonstrated through the obtained low coefficients of variation (CV) of 6.73%. With let-7a as detection target, the LOD of the established method is determined to be 243 aM, while maintaining a high discriminating capability towards let-7a homogenous miRNAs.
