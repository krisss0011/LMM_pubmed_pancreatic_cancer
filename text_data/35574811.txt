Background:Recent findings support the hypothesis of sex-related differences in inflammatory and immunological responses to trauma. The aim of this study was to address sex-specific aspects in patients who underwent pancreatic surgery.Methods:This retrospective study used data from the German StuDoQ registry. Patients who underwent pancreatic surgery between 2010 and 2020 were stratified according to procedure (pancreatic head resection, distal pancreatectomy (DP), total pancreatectomy (TP)). Each cohort underwent propensity score matching (PSM) with the co-variables BMI, ASA, age, coronary heart disease (CHD), diabetes, hypertension with medication, and histology to level the distribution of co-morbidities between men and women. The main outcomes were morbidity and mortality.Results:The total cohort consisted of 10 224 patients (45.3 per cent women). Men had higher ASA grades, and more often had CHD, diabetes, and hypertension with medication. Women had fewer overall complications (57.3 versus 60.1 per cent; P = 0.005) and a lower mortality rate (3.4 versus 4.9 per cent; P < 0.001). Rates of pancreatic surgery-specific complications, such as clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) (grade B/C: 14 versus 17 per cent; P < 0.001), delayed gastric emptying (grade B/C: 7.8 versus 9.2 per cent; P = 0.014), and postpancreatectomy haemorrhage (grade B/C: 7.1 versus 9.0 per cent; P < 0.001), were also lower in women. After PSM, 8358 patients were analysed. In the pancreatic head resection cohort (5318 patients), women had fewer complications (58.6 versus 61.4 per cent; P = 0.044), a lower in-hospital mortality rate (3.6 versus 6.1 per cent; P < 0.001), and less often had clinically relevant POPF (11.6 versus 16.2 per cent; P < 0.001). After DP, the clinically relevant POPF rate was lower in women (22.5 versus 27.3 per cent; P = 0.012). In the TP cohort, men more often developed intra-abdominal abscess requiring drainage (5.0 versus 2.3 per cent; P = 0.050).Conclusion:Women had favourable outcomes after pancreatic surgery.
