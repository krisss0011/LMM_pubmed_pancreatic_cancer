C-Myc overexpression is a common finding in pancreatic cancer and predicts the aggressive behavior of cancer cells. It binds to the promoter of different genes, thereby regulating their transcription. C-Myc is downstream of KRAS and interacts with several oncogenic and proliferative pathways in pancreatic cancer. C-Myc enhances aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells and regulates glutamate biosynthesis from glutamine. It provides enough energy for cancer cells' metabolism and sufficient substrate for the synthesis of organic molecules. C-Myc overexpression is associated with chemoresistance, intra-tumor angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and metastasis in pancreatic cancer. Despite its title, c-Myc is not "undruggable" and recent studies unveiled that it can be targeted, directly or indirectly. Small molecules that accelerate c-Myc ubiquitination and degradation have been effective in preclinical studies. Small molecules that hinder c-Myc-MAX heterodimerization or c-Myc/MAX/DNA complex formation can functionally inhibit c-Myc. In addition, c-Myc can be targeted through transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and translational modifications.
