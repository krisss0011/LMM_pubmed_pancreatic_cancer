Objectives:We investigated whether there is a difference in the frequency of comorbidity between patients with pancreatic cysts and those without pancreatic cysts by abdominal ultrasonography in patients undergoing medical checkup screening.Methods:The subjects were 6,627 patients who underwent abdominal ultrasonography at Tokai University Hachioji Hospital's Health Screening Center between April 2019 and March 2020.Results:Of the total 6,627 patients, 158 (2.4%) were pointed out to have pancreatic cysts. Multivariate analysis revealed that the related factors were female sex, age 60 years or older, diabetes, lung cancer, and uterine/ovarian cancer.Conclusion:Unlike pancreatic cancer, pancreatic cysts are more common in women. In addition, it is known that pancreatic cysts have a high complication rate of cancers of other organs; lung cancer and uterine/ovarian cancer were identified as high-risk factors in this study.
