Background/aim:Our laboratory pioneered the patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) model. An important goal of PDOX-model development is facile visualization of metastasis in live mice. In the present report we evaluated tumor growth and metastasis in pancreatic cancer PDOX NOG [Non-obese diabetes (NOD)/Scid/IL2RÎ³null]-and nude-mouse models using red fluorescent protein (RFP)-expressing tumor stroma to visualize the primary tumor and metastasis.Materials and methods:A patient-derived pancreatic cancer was initially implanted in transgenic RFP-expressing nude mice. Then, tumor fragments, which acquired RFP expressing stroma while growing in RFP-expressing nude mice were orthotopically implanted in nude and NOG mice. The primary pancreatic tumor and metastasis were observed 8 weeks after implantation.Results:Lymph-node metastases expressing red fluorescence were detected only in NOG mice. Significantly faster growth of primary pancreatic tumors and a higher incidence of lymph-node metastasis occurred in NOG mice compared to nude mice.Conclusion:RFP-expressing tumor stroma, which traffics together with cancer cells to lymph nodes, is useful to observe tumor behavior, such as lymph-node metastasis in a PDOX NOG-mouse model which can be used for evaluation of novel anti-metastatic agents, as well as personalized therapy to identify effective drugs.
