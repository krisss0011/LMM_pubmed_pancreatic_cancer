Elastography is a non-invasive method widely used to measure the stiffness of the tissues, and it is available in most endoscopic ultrasound machines, using either qualitative or quantitative techniques. Endoscopic ultrasound elastography is a tool that should be applied to obtain a complementary evaluation of pancreatic diseases, together with other imaging tests and clinical data. Elastography can be informative, especially when studying pancreatic masses and help the clinician in the differential diagnosis between benign or malignant lesions. However, further studies are necessary to standardize the method, increase the reproducibility and establish definitive cut-offs to distinguish between benign and malignant pancreatic masses. Moreover, even if promising, elastography still provides little information in the evaluation of benign conditions.
