Clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) is one of the most prevalent kidney cancers, which is often asymptomatic and thus
discovered at a metastatic state (mRCC). mRCC are highly heterogeneous tumors composed of subclonal populations that lead to
poor treatment response rate. Several recent works explored the potential of ccRCC tumoroids culture derived from patients.
However, these models were produced following a scaffold-based method using collagen I or Matrigel that exhibit lot variabilityand whose complexity could induce treatment response modi ﬁcations and phenotypic alterations. Following the observation that
ccRCC tumoroids can create their own niche by secreting extracellular matrix components, we developed the ﬁrst scaffold-free
tumoroid model of ccRCC tumors. Tumoroids from mice as well as from human tumors were generated with high success rate(≥90%) using a magnetic suspension method and standard culture media. Immuno ﬂuorescence analysis revealed their self-
organization capacities to maintain multiple tumor-resident cell types, including endothelial progenitor cells. Transcriptomic
analysis showed the reproducibility of the method highlighting that the majority of gene expression patterns was conserved intumoroids compared to their matching tumor tissue. Moreover, this model enables to evaluate drug effects and invasiveness of
renal cancer cells in a 3D context, providing a robust preclinical tool for drug screening and biomarker assessment in line with
alternative ex vivo methods like tumor tissue slice culture or in vivo xenograft models.

INTRODUCTION
Kidney cancer represents the 8th most frequent type of cancers in
the word [ 1]. Among them, Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) is the most
common and englobes a number of histological subtypescomprising clear cell RCC (ccRCC) and papillary RCC. The mostfrequent is ccRCC, which represents 70 –80% of patients, followed
by papillary RCC, which represents 10 –15% [ 2,3]. RCC patients are
often asymptomatic, leading to 30% of metastatic RCC (mRCC) atdiagnosis. Moreover, 10% of patients that are undergoing surgeryfor a localized cancer will relapse and develop mRCC during their
follow up [ 4]. mRCC can be treated with Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors
(TKI) or Immunotherapy [ 5]. Recently, a combination of Immune
checkpoint inhibitors like Ipilimumab plus Nivolumab has been
approved for Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma management [ 6].
However, intrinsic and therapy-induced heterogeneity, andchanges in the tumor microenvironment often yield to multiplecross-resistance mechanisms in non-responder patients. Phylo-
genic studies showed that subclonal populations with different
mutations arise from the trunk mutations that are present in allregions of the tumor before formation of the founder cancer cells.Those subclones are often responsible of metastasis and are notmany to be detected by bulk sequencing [ 6–9]. This leads to
mRCC patients with a therapeutic response that differs signi ﬁ-
cantly independently of their trunk mutation status [ 10,11].
Tumors appear as complex systems with many elements that
display dynamic spatial and temporal evolution as they progressand respond to stressors, including the immune system and
cancer therapies. Recently, advances in tumor models have
demonstrated the value of organoid technology for the genera-tion of in vitro three-dimensional models, including patient-derived organoids that have been shown to more accurately
recapitulate the structures, speci ﬁc functions, molecular charac-
teristics, genomic alterations and tumor microenvironment ofprimary tumors. In addition, they may be useful for identifying
in vitro drug response as well as biomarker assessment to help
guiding personalized therapy and molecular pro ﬁles to de ﬁne
predicative molecular pro ﬁles of drug responsive tumors [ 12–14].
The need for such a dynamic system is emphasized by the high
failure rate of drugs tested in clinical trials. Indeed, the success rate
for cancer treatments is 3.4% in phase I –III clinical trials [ 15]. Sato

1234567890();,:referred to as tumoroids [ 16]. Subsequently, tumoroids of
numerous cancer types were established [ 14], including prostate
[17], ovarian [ 18], brain [ 19,20], bladder [ 21], gastric [ 22–24],
esophageal [ 25] revealing that patient-derived tumoroids recapi-
tulate patient-speci ﬁc histological features. However, their use in
theﬁeld of kidney cancers remains limited [ 26–30]. Over all those
methods, establishment success rates varied widely, across the
different sources of tumor tissue they were generated from. Theycan be derived from primary tumors, metastatic lesions, tumorcells from liquid effusion or circulating tumor cells [ 13]. Following
collection, processing of tumor samples can be achieved with
different strategies like enzymatic and/or mechanic dissociation,and tumoroids can be formed from progenitor single cell,multicellular reassembly or millimeter-scale tumor fragments
[17,22]. Several recent works describe the establishment and
characterization of ccRCC organoid cultures derived from patients ’
tissues revealing biological insights for ccRCC research [ 25,27–30].
However, for their establishment, these organoid models rely on
their plating on low-density Matrigel ®or type 1 Collagen matrices
that might introduce unknown variables into culturing experi-ments. Thus, there is an emerging need to develop Matrigel ®-
independent organoid culture methods. Despite the assumption
that a matrix is required to sustain long-term organoid culture, itwas hypothesized that cells in the organoid may create their ownniche by secreting extracellular matrix components. This led to the
development of matrix-free culture systems for a narrow range of
tissues [ 31–33]. In the present work, we describe the establish-
ment, characterization and several applications of a matrix-free
technique for the culture of renal tumor organoids (tumoroids)
derived from renal tumor xenografts in mice or human tumorsurgical specimen. We provide a phenotypical, transcriptomic andmolecular analysis of these organoids and the corresponding
tumors. Moreover, we found a clear concordance of the tumor
response to treatments in this tumoroid culture model comparedto tumor slice cultures or orthotopic renal cancer xenografts.
RESULTS
Establishment of ccRCC tumoroid culturesWe generated renal tumor in mice by surgically implanting 786-O-
Luc or ACHN-Luc cells under the renal capsula. 786-O cell line is a
classically used ccRCC cell line that harbors VHL mutation andconstitutively active HIF α, while ACHN cell line is de ﬁned as
papillary RCC without VHL mutation [ 34,35]. Human ccRCC
specimen were collected fresh at the time of surgical resection atthe Grenoble hospital and taken immediately to the laboratory forprocessing (Clinical trial NCT03571438). Several pieces of each
tumor were snap frozen for RNA isolation and cryo-microtome
sectioning. The remainder was mechanically and enzymaticallydissociated. After counting, dissociated cells were seeded toperform tumoroid culture, using a scaffold-free tumoroid method
(Fig. 1A). After 7 days, formation of live tumoroids was clearly
visible by microscope evaluation. Tumoroids were viable for atleast 14 days (Fig. 1B). Thus, with a success rate of 100% in mice
tumor samples and 90% in human tumors, this model allows an
accurate comparison to evaluate its translational potential withother effective pre-clinical cancer models.
Phenotypic characterization of ccRCC tumoroids
To determine whether phenotypic features are preserved in vitro,we histologically characterized the ccRCC tumoroids. Grossmorphology of tumoroids as well as examination of hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E) staining revealed that they generally resembled
the parental tumor tissue. Like in matching tumor tissue, 786-O-
derived tumoroids consist of dense packed cells with a ﬁlled
cytoplasm, an histological feature already reported in mouse
xenograft models [ 9], while ACHN show tubulo-papillary archi-
tecture with clear cell-like areas (Fig. 2A). In most tumoroids,different cell clusters could be distinguished demonstrating a
rather heterogeneous composition of different sub-populations
(Supp Fig. 1). The major one is represented by cancer cells,
assessed by the expression of vimentin and the classical ccRCC-speci ﬁc marker CAIX [ 3,36]. A second population showed strong
enrichment for stromal markers such as FAP, thus likely
representing ﬁbroblasts (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, Pan Collagen
labeling was mainly intracellular, suggesting that cells were ableto produce de novo collagen to build their own extracellularmatrix (Fig. 2Ca ,b )[ 37]. Enrichment for the progenitor-like marker
CD44 was observed mostly at the periphery of several tumoroids
(Fig. 2C a, b), as in the parental tumor tissue (Fig. 2C c). While
Ki67 staining was weak in tumor tissues (Fig. 2C f), this
proliferation index was restored in growing tumoroids (Fig. 2C
d,e). Clusters of CD68
+cells were observed at the periphery of the
tumoroids (Fig. 2C g, h), likely representing tumor-associated
macrophages (TAMs) that are the most abundant immune cell
population in ﬁltrating the tumor microenvironment (Fig. 2Ci )
[38,39]. Interestingly, at day 12 and 15 of culture, both 786-O and
ACHN tumoroids disclosed CD31+cells that form circular layers of
oriented packed cells at the surface of the structure, tentatively
evoking a primitive vascular-like plexus as in the original tissue
(Fig. 2D and S1). These CD31+cells also expressed vimentin (Fig.
2E a, white arrow) and more importantly collagen, in higher
proportions than other cell types (Fig. 2E b, white arrow),
suggesting that CD31+cells may start to secrete collagen IV that
has been shown to be necessary to create their basementmembrane [ 40,41].

expression levels in 786-O or ACHN tumoroids compared to
the original tumor tissue (4 tumoroids grouped per cell line). Asp r e v i o u s l ys h o w ni nF i g . 2,C D 3 1
+cells were detectable in the
tumoroids albeit with a reduced expression compared to the
parental tumors, suggesting that angiogenesis is weak in
growing tumoroids. Of note, many cell nuclei in thesetumoroids, were positive for K i67 staining as compared to
the original tissue, indicating that actively dividing cells were
still present after >2 weeks of cul ture. Surprisingly, compared
to original tumor tissues, E-cad herin expression was lower in
the 786-O tumoroids while higher in the ACHN tumoroids. In
contrast, both types of tumoroids showed a similar expression
of CAIX, vimentin, FAP, CD44 and CD68 as compared toparental tissues. In summary, this analysis reveals that differenttumor-resident cell types such as cancer cells, ﬁbroblasts, CD44
progenitor-like cells and in ﬁltrated macrophages were pre-
served in these tumoroids.
We then performed a pairwise correlation of expression of cell-
speci ﬁc markers in tumoroids and their respective tumor tissue
(Fig. 3C). As previously described, no clear correlation was found
for CD31 and Ki67 expression. Compared to the original tumortissues, CD31
+cells were reduced in the tumoroids while cell
proliferation was increased. In contrast, signi ﬁcant correlations
were found for FAP, vimentin, CAIX, CD68 and CD44, thusindicating that tumoroids are able to retain the inter-tumorheterogeneity present in the tumor tissues. Finally, ~40% of the
cells in the tumoroids were producing a collagen matrix,
regardless of its amount present in their respective original tissue.This suggests that tumoroids are capable to synthetize de novocollagen, in order to restore the ECM lost during the enzymatic
dissociation process.
Altogether, these data indicate that these renal tumoroids
display diverse differentiated cell types that are present in their
respective original tumor tissue. Moreover, the tumoroids preserve
the integrated stroma, which includes the extracellular matrix,vascular-like structures and other cell types.I. Séraudie et al.

Cell Death and Disease          (2023) 14:622 Gene expression of tumoroids and tumor tissues
To evaluate genetic similarities between tumoroids and the
corresponding tumor tissues, we performed RNA sequencing ofcells for each experimental condition (see “Methods ”). Since we
injected human cancer cells into mice, cancer cells in the tumorswere human while microenvironment cells (i.e. Fibroblasts,
Immune cells, …) were derived from mice. Thus, the RNA
sequencing datasets generated from ACHN or 786-O tumortissues (AxM and 7xM) and their respective tumoroids (AxTy and7xTy) were mapped on human and mouse reference genome.
I. Séraudie et al.

Cell Death and Disease          (2023) 14:622 We initially performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering
analysis on gene expression values for human cancer cells and
mice microenvironment cells (Fig. 4A, B respectively). For cancer
cells (Fig. 4A), all ACHN tumoroids (AxTy) were grouped as their
tumoral tissues (AxM). Moreover, 786-O tumoroids matched withtissue 71 M, indicating that tumoroids and the tumoral tissue
shared a high similarity in cancer cell transcriptional pro ﬁles.
Looking at the microenvironmental cells (Fig. 4B), all tumor tissues
were clustered together, suggesting that the in vivo tumormicroenvironment is quite stable, independently of the cancer cell
line. Moreover, ACHN and 786-O tumoroids were respectively
forming a cluster. This means that the microenvironment of all
tumoroids derived from the same cancer cell line were close,advocating for a good reproducibility of the tumoroid productionprotocol. More precisely, the method kept the same proportion
and cell diversity in all tumoroids produced from the same tumor.
786-O tumoroids were closer to their original tumor tissuecompared to ACHN tumoroids in agreement with the observation

One fraction is fresh frozen while the second fraction is coated with iron nanoparticles toproduce tumoroids thanks to a magnetic spheroid drive.

Cell Death and Disease          (2023) 14:622 that 786-O tumors are often more homogeneous than ACHN
tumors in vivo. Of note, ACHN tumor tissues and tumoroids were
not grouped together, indicating that tumoroids have lost some of
the microenvironment cells, which may correspond to endothelialcells as described before (Fig. 3B, C). Also, branching lengths
separating the cluster of samples were smaller for human cancer
cells (Fig. 4A) compared to microenvironment cells (Fig. 4B),
suggesting a greater heterogeneity between tumoroids at themicroenvironment level compared to tumor cells.
We then performed comparisons between tissues (AxM or 7xM)
and their respective tumoroids (AxTx or 7xTx) for cancer and
microenvironment gene expression data (Suppl. Table 1 and Table2). For each sample pairwise comparison, we identi ﬁed differen-
tially expressed genes using a Log2 fold change plot. This
consisted of counting the number of conserved genes for a range
of thresholds of [Log2 fold change] and selecting the thresholdcorresponding to the in ﬂection point of the curve. From ~12,000
expressed genes, we carried out pairwise differential gene
expression analyzes between a tissue and its tumoroids. Between100 and 400 genes were identi ﬁed as differentially expressed
highlighting high similarities between tumoroids and their
corresponding tumor tissues, either for human cancer cells (Fig.
4C) or microenvironment mouse cells (Fig. 4D). Moreover, an
intersection size analysis (black dots and lines Fig. 4C, D),
considering sets of more than 10 genes, showed that many
deregulated genes were shared between the tumoroids produced
from the same tumor, whereas no common deregulation wasobserved between tumoroids derived from different tumors.
Ontological enrichment analyzes were performed from these lists
of differentially expressed genes. However, the low number ofderegulated genes did not reveal pathways of interest forinterpreting the differences between tissue and tumoroid (data
not shown).
Altogether, these data reveal that most of the tumoroids can
preserve gene expression features associated with both the maintumor-resident and microenvironment cells of the source material.
Importantly, the rather limited variability in the number of
deregulated genes observed in the tumoroids compared to thesame tumor tissue could be due to cell reprogramming imposedby enzymatic deconstruction of the tumor tissue and cell
suspension culture that may affect the original cell-cell and cell-
ECM interactions. Finally, the higher variability of gene expressionthat we observed in the tumoroid microenvironment is reminis-
cent of the intra-tumor spatial genetic heterogeneity described in
ccRCC [ 42].
Three-dimensional tumoroid invasion
Invasion is one of the ﬁrst mechanisms that cancer cells use to
escape from a primary tumor before metastatic colony formationin distant organs. To examine invasion in a 3D physiologicalcontext, spheroids generated from healthy kidney cells (RPTEC) or
ccRCC cells (786-O, Caki-1) or papillary RCC cells (ACHN) were fully
embedded within TissueSpec Kidney ®hydrogel and incubated
with different cell culture media. We then determined the cell
capacity to escape from spheroids, to migrate and later on, to
survive in the surrounding 3D matrix after 7 days of culture. Asshown in Fig. 5A, no sign of invasion was detected in RPTEC
spheroids. In contrast, cells from spheroids generated from the
three different renal cancer cell lines, actively invaded at variable
extents in this functional assay. Unexpectedly, in either DMEM orTumorMACS media, the invasive capacity of ACHN cells that areestablished as invasive, was weak as compared to Caki-1 and 786-
O cells. Moreover, their invasiveness as well as their cell circularity
were statistically increased in the TumorMACS ®medium (Fig. 5B,
C). Cancer cell invasion is known to be regulated by Calpain-2-
mediated cleavage of the focal adhesion and invadopodia-
associated protein talin [ 43,44], leading to ameboid conversion
of disseminated cells [ 45]. As depicted in Fig. 5D, E, Calpain-2activity was clearly detectable after 7 days of culture and
signi ﬁcantly increased in cells escaping from Caki-1 and 786-O
spheroids cultured in TumorMACS ®medium, suggesting an
ameboid-like mode of invasion [ 46].
We next examined cell invasion using mice-derived tumoroids.
Cells egressing from ACHN or 786-O tumoroids and invading the
surrounding matrix were viable after 7 days (Fig. 5
F). The escaping
cells, which were identi ﬁed as renal cancer cells disclosed a round-
shaped phenotype in TumorMACS ®compared to DMEM (CAIX/E-
cadherin staining). Notably, cell egress from these tumoroids was
strongly increased in the TumorMACS ®medium (Fig. 5G), while
cell circularity in both types of tumoroids was variable (Fig. 5H).
Pairwise comparisons of invasion length and circularity show thatin both culture media, cells escaping from ACHN or 786-O
tumoroids with the lowest circularity, displayed enhanced
invasiveness (Fig. 5I, J, K). In contrast, in the presence of
TumorMACS ®(Fig. 5L), invading cells from 786-O tumoroids had
a different migration behavior with enhanced circularity leading to
a more deformable and viscous phenotype [ 47]. This behavior can
be possibly correlated with their high Calpain-2 activity and lowvimentin expression (Fig. 5M).
Altogether, data from these studies highlight that both
culturing conditions and the cell characteristics are importantdeterminants affecting the migration mode of invading cells. Inparticular, the TumorMACS ®medium may contain a signaling
molecule composition that could promote round-shaped ame-
boid-like migration of 786-O cells, while DMEM does not [ 48,49].
In line with this, 786-O cells that have a constitutive activation of
HIFα, would be more receptive and prone to Calpain-2-mediated
ameboid migration [ 45].
Comparative responses to treatment on ex vivo and in vivo
tumor models
Various preclinical studies have been used as models to studyresponses to chemotherapies, although only a few have madedirect clinical comparisons to responses in patients [ 50]. 786-O
and ACHN cells grown as spheroids or as tumoroids derived from
mice tumor samples were subjected to the FDA-approvedcompound sunitinib, used for ﬁrst-line treatment of ccRCC or to
KU-60019 plus CX-4945 (KU-CX), a combined inhibition of ATM
and CK2 kinases, which has shown promising activities in a
previously published drug screen [ 10]. After 48 h of treatment,
spheroids as well as tumoroids were highly sensitive to sunitinib
or the KU-CX combination (Fig. 6A, B). Similarly, renal tumor slice
cultures displayed sensitivity to the same drug concentrations (Fig.6C, D). Thus, three different models (spheroids, tumoroids, and
tumor slices) derived from the same ccRCC sample showed similar
early drug sensitivities. We also performed xenograft studies by
subcutaneously injecting 786-O luc cells into mice. Oral drugadministration started when average tumor size reached about250 to 300 mm
3. Mice were treated for ten consecutive days with
the KU-CX combination or Sunitinib (Fig. 6E, F). In concordance
with the effect observed on the tumoroid or the tumor slicemodels, growth inhibition of the corresponding tumor in mice
matched the effective concentrations of sunitinib or the drug
combination, validating our renal tumoroids as a relevant modelfor biological screening of anti-cancer compounds.
Phenotypic characterization and treatment response of
human renal tumoroidsUsing our scaffold-free tumoroid method, multiple patient-derived renal cancer tumoroids were successfully generated with
high ef ﬁciency (90%) from patient ’s tumor samples (Fig. S2A).
Among them, NJ115 was identi ﬁed as a grade pT1a ccRCC by
pathologists. H&E staining revealed that the renal clear cell
phenotype of the original NJ115 tissue was conserved in the
tumoroids (Fig. 7A). NJ115 tumoroids were sensitive to Sunitinib
only (Fig. 7B) while corresponding organotypic slice culture wasI. Séraudie et al.
7
Cell Death and Disease          (2023) 14:622 sensitive to both KU-CX and Sunitinib (Fig. 7C), unveiling
differences in drug sensitivity of both models. We performed
immuno ﬂuorescence labeling on NJ115 tumoroids and the
original tumor tissue using different biomarkers (Fig. 7D).
Surprisingly, grouped analysis of their expression levels in
NJ115 tumoroids compared to the original tumor tissue
(Fig. 7E) showed a decrease in E-cadherin expression, lack of
CD44+progenitor-like cells and absence of cell proliferation. In
contrast, we found similar expression levels of FAP, Vimentin,
CAIX, CD68, CD31 and Pan Collagen.In MZ076 and CM095 tumoroids, intratumor CD31+cells were
present. Moreover, in ﬁltrating CD8+cells were detected in MZ076
tumoroids (Fig. S2B). Collectively, this means that multiple celltypes and matrix components such as ﬁbroblasts, cancer cells,
macrophages, T-lymphocytes, endothelial cells and de novo
collagen production were also maintained in patient-derived
tumoroids. Interestingly, the addition of F12 and EGF in the culturemedia seemed suf ﬁcient to preserve CD31
+endothelial progeni-
tor cells that may participate to the formation of endothelial
venules (see Fig. 7E and S2B).

Cell Death and Disease          (2023) 14:622 Altogether, these data indicate that it is feasible to produce
patient-derived renal cancer tumoroids with high ef ﬁciency, even
from low-grade tumors. They provide a biologically relevant
model system that recapitulates tumor intrinsic characteristics,preserving the cell diversity of the parental tumor. Consequently,they could be used as avatars to screen new drugs.
DISCUSSION
Evidences were provided that tumoroids derived from primary cell
lines lose inter-tumor heterogeneity as well as the appropriatefeatures of the tumor from which they originated [ 51]. In contrast,the use of functional assays involving personalized ex vivo tumor
models such as tumoroids generated from patient tumor samples
have shown many advantages to recapitulate patient ’s tumors
properties as well as to predict patient ’s treatment response
[21,52]. They have been proposed as avatars to capture individual
patient responses to therapy and for their accuracy to recapitulate
cancer heterogeneity [ 14]. Moreover, they take into account the
wider tumor microenvironment, that can modulate treatmentresponse to chemotherapy or even immunotherapy [ 53].
Here, we demonstrated, for the ﬁrst time, the feasibility of
culturing mice as well as human ccRCC tumoroids, directly fromfresh tissue using a scaffold-free method. We could establish a

Cell Death and Disease          (2023) 14:622 stable culture method using magnets that are known not to be
toxic and not to alter treatment response [ 33,54]. Moreover, our
model preserves the cellular heterogeneity and tumor micro-environment. RNA sequencing showed the reproducibility of the
method, highlighting that the transcriptome was well conserved
in tumoroids compared to their matching tumor tissue. Patient-derived tumoroids have a weak proliferation index, which is often
the case with ccRCC tumors that have a Ki67 positive median of
5% [ 55]. Importantly, immuno ﬂuorescence analysis revealed that
they were also able to maintain multiple tumor-resident cell types,including endothelial progenitor cells, which were never reported
in other ccRCC tumoroid culture models (Fig. 4B, D). Vasculatureestablishment usually requires shear stress and micro ﬂuidic
devices as it was demonstrated for the development of perfusedhealthy kidney organoids [ 56]. Our tumoroid model disclosed rare
endothelial progenitor cells that were able to form plexus-like
structures, suggesting that the tumoroid composition can be
further optimized by altering the media conditions. As alreadyreported [ 57], we found that addition of EGF to patient-derived
tumoroids was suf ﬁcient to maintain a signi ﬁcant population of
endothelial progenitor cells. Lastly, we showed that spheroidsgenerated from different renal cancer cell lines or mice tumoroidsprovide opportunities to evaluate the invasiveness of renal cancer
cells in a 3D physiological context. This analysis revealed that

Cell Death and Disease          (2023) 14:622 spheroids as well as tumoroids derived from different cell lines did
not exhibit the same invasive capacities.
In summary, although tumoroids lack active vascular networks
limiting their utility for in-depth study of the effects ofimmunotherapies, our scaffold-free tumoroid model provides arobust preclinical tool for drug screening and biomarker assess-
ment in line with alternative ex vivo methods like tumor tissue
slice culture or in vivo xenograft models. This is timely relevantsince Food and Drug Administration no longer has to requireanimal testing for new drugs to receive approval, supporting
alternative methods such as organoids in predicting cancer drug
efﬁcacies [ 58].
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Cell culture
ccRCC cell lines 786-O, Caki-1 and ACHN were obtained from ATCC (CRL-
1932, HTB-46 and CRL-1611 respectively). The cell lines were grown in10 cm diameter plates in a humidi ﬁed incubator (37 °C, 5% CO
2) with RPMI
1640 medium (Gibco) containing 10% of fetal bovine calf serum, penicillin
(100 U/mL) and streptomycin (100 µg/mL). RPTEC cell line was obtain fromEvercyte and grown in ProXup media (Evercyte). To produce spheroids,cells were counted and coated with magnetic NanoShuttle (Greiner) (1 µLper 20,000 cells) thanks to 3 centrifugation/resuspension cycles at 400 g for5 min each. Cells were seeded into U-bottom 96-well plates coated with
20 mg/mL poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PolyHema) (Sigma-Aldrich)
at the density of 1500 cells per well, centrifuged at 400 g for 5 min andthen were grown for 3 days.
Generation of luciferase expressing cells
786-O and ACHN cells were plated into 6-well plates in 2 mL of serum-supplemented RPMI 1640 medium. The day after, adherent cells wereinfected with Lenti-II-CMV-Luc-IRES-GFP virus (ABM, Deutschland) (1 –5 MOI
(multiplicity of infection)) diluted in 1 mL of serum-supplemented medium
containing 8 µg/mL of polybrene (Sigma). After 4 h, 1 mL of medium wasadded to each well and transduction was maintained for 16 h beforechanging the medium. For stable transduction, puromycin selectionstarted 36 h post-infection (at the concentration of 2 µg/mL) andmaintained for 2 weeks.
Mice orthotopic and subcutaneous tumor xenograft model
All animal studies were approved by the institutional guidelines and thoseformulated by the European Community for the Use of ExperimentalAnimals. Renal orthotopic implantation was carried out by injection of1.10
6786-O luc or ACHN luc cells into the left kidney of athymic nude mice
(6 weeks-old female BALB/c Nude, CByJ.Cg-Foxn1nu 522 /J; Charles River)
as previously described [ 10,59]. Subcutaneous xenografts were obtained
by injecting 8.106786-O luc cells on the back of athymic nude mice. Tumor
growth was followed by intraperitoneal injection of 150 mg/kg D-luciferinPotassium salt using IVIS Imager (Perkin Elmer).
Patients and clinical samples
All human renal carcinoma samples were obtained from patients, withtheir informed consent, and all procedures were approved by the ethics
committee (Patient Protection Committee No. 2017 A0070251). Patients
were recruited under the clinical trial, Comborein (NCT03572438) [ 60].
Fresh renal tumor tissue was obtained from patients undergoing a partialor a total nephrectomy for cancer at the Urology Department, UniversityHospital Center of Grenoble, Alpes (CHUGA).
Fresh tissue sectioning
A Vibratome VT1200 (Leica Microsystems) was used to cut thin (300 µm)slices from fresh tumor tissue as previously described [ 10,11]. Brie ﬂy,
samples were soaked in ice-cold sterile-balanced salt solution (HBSS),orientated, mounted and immobilized using cyanoacrylate glue. Slicingspeed was comprised between 0.03 –0.08 mm/s depending on tissue
stiffness. Vibration amplitude was set between 2.95 and 3.0 mm.
Organotypic tissue cultures
Tissue slices were cultured as previously described [ 10,11]. Brie ﬂy, they
were cultured on organotypic inserts for 48 h (one slice per insert;Millipore) at 37 °C in a 5% CO 2humidi ﬁed incubator under agitation, using
2 mL of DMEM media supplemented with 10% inactivated fetal bovineserum (FBS) (GIBCO), 100 U/mL penicillin +streptomycin (Invitrogen). The
slices were incubated with the following compounds dissolved in DMSO:
KU-60019 (10 µM; Selleck Chem) plus CX-4945 (10 µM; Plateau Synthèse
Organique, UGA); Sunitinib (10 µM; Selleck Chem) and DMSO (0.1%; Sigma)as control. After 48 h the viability of tumor slices was assayed [ 11].
Cell dissociation and tumoroids production
Cell dissociation was perform thanks to the gentleMACS Dissociator and
the Tumor dissociation kit (Miltenyl Biotec) according to manufacturer ’s
instructions. Brie ﬂy, pieces of fresh tumors from mice or patients were
chopped with a scalpel and transferred into the “C”dissociation tube.
Chopped tumor was suspended in supplemented DMEM and enzymesfrom the kit (A, H and R). Mechanical dissociation was performed by 3cycles of stirring using the GentleMACS Dissociator. Between each cycle,the tube was incubated 30 min at 37 °C for enzymatic digestion. Cell
suspension was then ﬁltered and washed through the MACS SmartStrai-
ners (70 µm pores) to remove undissociated particles. Cells werecentrifuged at 300 g for 5 min and Red Blood Cells (RBC) were lysedthanks to the RBC Lysis buffer during 4 min at 4 °C. The reaction wasstopped by PBS addition. Cells were counted and coated with magneticNanoShuttle (Greiner) (1 µL per 20,000 cells) thanks to 3 centrifugation/resuspension cycles at 400 g for 5 min each. Cells were seeded into ﬂat
repellent 96-well plates (Greiner) at the density of 10,000 cells per well. For
tumoroids formation, plates were maintained on the Spheroid Drivesupport (Greiner) for 14 days at 37 °C with 5% CO
2in a humidi ﬁed
incubator as described in [ 33]. Mice tumoroids were cultured in DMEM
media supplemented with 10% FBS (GIBCO), 100 U/mL penicillin +
streptomycin (Invitrogen), while human tumoroids were cultured in
DMEM/F12 (1/1) supplemented with 10% FBS (GIBCO), 100 U/mL penicillin
+streptomycin, and 10 ng/mL EGF.
Three-dimension (3D) cell death measurements
Three days-old spheroids (786-O and ACHN) and 14 days-old tumoroids
were transferred into a U-bottom 96-well plate coated with 20 mg/mLpolyHema. They were treated for 48 h, with KU-60019 (10 µM) plus CX-
4945 (10 µM) or Sunitinib (10 µM) or DMSO (0.1%) as control. To assess cell
death, 0.5 µg/mL Propidium iodide (PI) was added to the culture during allthe treatment. PI incorporation was followed in real time with the IncucyteZOOM ®imager.
Invasion assay
Three days-old spheroids and 14 days-old tumoroids were included in
TissueSpec Kidney®hydrogel (Xylyx Bio, New York, USA). At day 0 and 7,
cells were stained with Live and Dead viability kit containing Calcein and
Ethidium Homodimer (Invitrogen). They were also stained with CMAC t-BOC-Leu-Met (Invitrogen) for calpain activity measurement. CMAC is acalpain peptidase substrate that will ﬂuoresce when cleaved by active
calpain [ 46]. Image analysis was performed using Icy and ImageJ softwares.
Cryomicrotome sectioning
Pieces of fresh tumors and tumoroids were ﬁxed in paraformaldehyde 4%
(Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. The pieces were included in OCTmounting medium and frozen in liquid nitrogen up to solidi ﬁcation.
Tissues and tumoroids were conserved at −80 °C before use. Slices (8 µm
thick) were cut with a Cryo-microtome (Leica) to perform immuno ﬂuor-
escence and Hematoxylin and Eosin staining for tumor characterization.
Immuno ﬂuorescence labeling of tumoroids
Tumoroids were labeled one by one in a ﬂat repellent 96-well plate. For all
liquid removing steps, we used the Handling Magnetic support (Greiner) to
keep tumoroids inside the wells while removing the solutions. Tumoroidswere washed in PBS and ﬁxed in paraformaldehyde 4% (Sigma) for 1 h at
4 °C. All the next steps were performed under horizontal agitation (60 rpm).After 10 min in PBS-Tween20 0.1%, they were permeabilized and saturated1 h in Organoid Washing Buffer (OWB) containing 0.1% Triton-X100 and0.2% BSA diluted in PBS. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at
4 °C. On the second day, tumoroids were washed 3 times during 2 h in
OWB and secondary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C. On thethird day, tumoroids were washed 3 times and during the second one,Hoechst was added to OWB (1/1000
e) for nuclei staining. At the end,I. Séraudie et al.

(Invitrogen #a11001, 1/2000e) and 488 Goat anti-Mouse IgM µ chain
(Invitrogen #a21042, 1/2000e).
Immuno ﬂuorescence labeling of cryomicrotome slices
Frozen slices were allowed to stabilize at room temperature (RT) for 10 min.
They were washed 3 times with PBS (1X) and then permeabilized in PBSTriton-X100 0.5% for 10 min at RT. After 3 washes in PBS-Tween20 0.05%,
they were saturated with PBS-Tween20 0.05%, 5% SVF and 0.2% BSA for
1 h at RT. Antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The day after, sliceswere washed 3 times in PBS-Tween20 0.05% and incubated for 1 h at RT inthe dark with secondary antibodies. Slices were washed 5 times in PBS-Tween20 0.05% and nuclei staining was performed with Hoechst for15 min at RT in the dark. After a ﬁnal wash, slices were mounted for
microscopy using Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech). Antibodies used
were the same as described for tumoroids labeling.
Hematoxylin and Eosin staining
Frozen slices were allowed to stabilize at room temperature (RT) for 10 min
and washed in water to remove OCT mounting medium. Slices were stainfor 40 s with Hematoxylin (Sigma) followed by washing using water andstain for 4 min using Eosin (Sigma). Slices were then dehydrated in ethanol
100% for 2 × 5 min and with Xylene for 2 × 2 min. Slices were mounted
using Merkoglass (Sigma) and visualized under microscope.
Fluorescence microscopy
Qualitative imaging was performed thanks to the confocal microscope LSM880 with AiryScan module (Zeiss) at the µLife platform, CEA Grenoble.Pictures were taken using the 40X oil objective. Quantitative imaging was
performed thanks to the CX7 Cell Insight high throughput confocal
microscope (ThermoFisher) at the CMBA platform, CEA Grenoble. Pictureswere taken using the 20X air objective (NA 0.45) for tumoroids and 10X airobjective (NA 0.4) for tissue slices. Image quanti ﬁcation was performed
with the Thermo Scienti ﬁc HCS studio Cellomics Software by using the
spot detector bio-application.
RNA extraction
RNA extracts from tumoroids were obtained using the RNeasy Micro Kit(Qiagen) following manufacturer ’s instructions. Two tumoroids were used
for each extract. RNA Extracts from tissues were obtained using theMirVana PARIS kit (ThermoFisher).
Bulk RNA Barcoding (BRB)-sequencing and raw data
preprocessing
BRB-sequencing was perfomed at the Research Institute for Environmental
and Occupational Health (Irset, Rennes, France) as previously described[10,61]. The ﬁrst read contains 16 bases that must have a quality score
>10. The ﬁrst 6 bp correspond to a unique sample-speci ﬁc barcode and the
following 10 bp to a unique molecular identi ﬁer (UMI). The second reads
were aligned to the human reference transcriptome from the UCSCwebsite (release hg38) using BWA version 0.7.4.4 with the non-defaultparameter “−l2 4”. The second reads were also aligned to the mouse
reference transcriptome from the UCSC website (release mm10) using BWA
version 0.7.4.4 with the non-default parameter “−l2 4”. Reads mapping to
several positions in the genome were ﬁltered out from the analysis. The
pipeline is described in Reference [ https://doi.org/10.1016/
j.chemosphere.2020.128468 ]. After quality control and data preprocessing,
a gene count matrix was generated by counting the number of uniqueUMIs associated with each gene (lines) for each sample (columns). Theresulting UMI matrix was further normalized by using the rlog transforma-
tion implemented in the DeSeq2 package [ https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-
014-0550-8 ]. Raw and preprocessed data were deposited at the ArrayEx-
press repository under the accession number E-MTAB-12928.Bioinformatics analysis
The hcut method of the factoextra package on R (version R 4. 1) with 2-3clusters is implemented on the original tumor tissue samples (A1M, A2Mand 71 M) and on the tumoroids samples (A1T1, A1T2, A1T3, A1T4, A2T1,
A2T2, A2T3, A2T4, 71T1, 71T2, 71T3), for the human genome (11443 genes)
and for the mouse genome (11914 genes) independently. This methodcomputes hierarchical clustering and splits the tree into 3 clusters. It alsoaccepts distance measurement methods based on pearson correlation. Tovisualize the results of the hierarchical clustering, we use the fviz_dendmethod of the R package factoextra (version R 4.1). This method allows
creating dendograms. We have chosen to perform the hierarchical
clustering and the dendrogram with three clusters. Indeed, a preliminaryanalysis of the shape of the dendrogram gave us an indication on thenumber of clusters to retain and then we calculated the inertia of theclustering tree. The result of these two observations was to realize thehierarchical clustering with three clusters. The distinct intersections of set
of genes or pathways were visualized by the make_comb_mat() function
with a mode parameter set to “distinct ”followed by the UpSet() function
from the ComplexHeatmap R/Bioconductor package (version 2.14.0).Intersection plots were generated using the UpsetPlot R package.
Statistical analysis
The statistical signi ﬁcance of differences between the means of two
groups was evaluated using GraphPad version 9. Tests are indicated below
in each ﬁgure legend.
