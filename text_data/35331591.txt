Background:/Purpose: Owing to the characteristics of IPMNs, which have variable skipped lesions along the main pancreatic duct (MPD), determining the surgical margins is very difficult. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and potential oncologic impact of intraoperative pancreatoscopy (IOP) compared to frozen section biopsy (FSB) in pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) for pancreatic head IPMNs.Methods:Data of patients who underwent PD for IPMNs of the pancreas between October 2007 and May 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. IOP was performed in selected patients with IPMNs with inconclusive MPD involvement based on preoperative evaluations. Patients were divided into two groups, IOP group, FSB group. Clinicopathologic features and oncologic outcomes were compared between two groups.Results:60 patients underwent PD (laparoscopic or robotic, 42; open, 18) for pancreatic head IPMNs. IOP was safely performed in 28 patients, including minimally invasive approach used in 21 patients (35%). IOP group had a significantly larger MPD size (9.15 ± 4.79 mm vs 6.43 ± 4.11 mm, p = 0.021). Based on IOP, the initial surgical plan could be changed in 5 patients (17.8%) for complete resection. Recurrence occurred in 2 patients in FSB group and 3 patients in IOP group during the follow-up period (33.2 months, [range, 3.5-131.4 months]). Overall disease-free survival rate did not significantly differ between two groups (p = 0.529).Conclusions:IOP can be safely performed in patients with pancreatic head IPMNs with MPD dilatation, even in the laparoscopic approach. Further studies evaluating the long-term oncologic effect of IOP for the management of IPMNs are required.
