Although neoadjuvant therapy (Nac) is recommended for high-risk resectable pancreatic cancer (R-PDAC), evidence regarding specific regimes is scarce. This report aimed to investigate the efficacy of S-1 Nac for R-PDAC. In a multicenter phase II trial, we investigated the efficacy of Nac S-1 (an oral fluoropyrimidine agent containing tegafur, gimeracil, and oteracil potassium) in R-PDAC patients. The protocol involved two cycles of preoperative S-1 chemotherapy, followed by surgery, and four cycles of postoperative S-1 chemotherapy. Two-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates were the primary endpoint. Overall survival (OS) rates and median survival time (MST) were secondary endpoints. Forty-nine patients were eligible, and 31 patients underwent resection following Nac, as per protocol (31/49; 63.3%). Per-protocol analysis included data from 31 patients, yielding the 2-year PFS rate of 58.1%, and 2-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates of 96.8%, 54.8%, and 44.0%, respectively. MST was 49.2 months. Intention-to-treat analysis involved 49 patients, yielding the 2-year PFS rate of 40.8%, and the 2-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates of 87.8%, 46.9%, and 33.9%, respectively. MST was 35.5 months. S-1 single regimen might be an option for Nac in R-PDAC; however, the high drop-out rate (36.7%) was a limitation of this study.
