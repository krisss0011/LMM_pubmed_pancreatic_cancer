Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive and difficult to treat cancers with tumors typically exhibiting high levels of chronic hypoxia. Hypoxia activates hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) that mediate cellular responses to adapt to low oxygen environments. Hypoxia also causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, increasing activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), a master regulator of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway that mediates cellular response to ER stress. ATF4 is overexpressed in PDAC and is associated with poor prognoses. While ATF4 promotes cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, most studies have been conducted under normoxia or acute hypoxia. The functions of ATF4 in chronic hypoxia remain largely unexplored. Using siRNA knockdown experiments of healthy skin fibroblast cells WS1 and PDAC cell lines PANC-1 and Mia-PaCa2 to analyze mRNA and protein expression levels, a novel ATF4 function was identified, in which it decreases HIF2α mRNA and increases HIF1α mRNA in chronic hypoxia while having no effect in acute hypoxia. A scratch assay was used to show that ATF4 decreases cell migration in chronic hypoxia as opposed to the increase in cell migration ATF4 imparts in acute hypoxia. Colony formation assay and cell viability assay showed that ATF4 promotes colony formation and cell viability in both chronic and acute hypoxia. In addition to the differential response of ATF4 in chronic hypoxia compared with acute hypoxia, this is the first time ATF4 has been implicated in regulation of response to hypoxia via interaction with HIF proteins in PDAC.
