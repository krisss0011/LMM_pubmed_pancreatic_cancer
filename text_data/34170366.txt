Objectives:To investigate clinical and CT factors associated with local resectability in patients with nonmetastatic pancreatic cancers after neoadjuvant chemotherapy ± radiation therapy (CRT).Methods:This retrospective study included consecutive patients with nonmetastatic pancreatic cancers who underwent neoadjuvant CRT between June 2009 and June 2019. Tumor size, tumor-vascular contact with artery/vein, and local resectability categories (resectable, borderline resectable, or locally advanced) were assessed at baseline and post-CRT CT. Baseline and post-CRT carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 levels were also assessed. Clinical or imaging features related to R0 resection were determined using logistic regression analysis.Results:A total of 179 patients (mean age, 62.4 ± 9.3 years; 92 men) were included. After neoadjuvant CRT, 105 (58.7%) patients received R0 resection, while 74 (41.3%) did not. R0 resection rates were significantly different according to post-CRT CT resectability categories (p < 0.001): 82.8% (48/58), 70.1% (47/67), and 18.5% (10/54) for resectable, borderline resectable, and locally advanced disease, respectively. For post-CRT borderline resectable disease, ≥ 50% decrease in CA 19-9 was significantly associated with R0 resection (odds ratio (OR), 3.160; p = 0.02). For post-CRT locally advanced disease, small post-CRT tumor size ≤ 2 cm (OR, 9.668; p = 0.026) and decreased tumor-arterial contact (OR, 24.213; p = 0.022) were significantly associated with R0 resection.Conclusion:Post-CRT CT resectability categorization may be useful for the assessment of R0 resectability in patients with pancreatic cancer following neoadjuvant CRT. Additionally, ≥ 50% decrease in CA 19-9 was associated with R0 resection in post-CRT borderline resectable disease, while small post-CRT tumor size and decreased tumor-arterial contact were with locally advanced disease.Key points:• R0 resection rates following neoadjuvant chemotherapy ± radiation therapy (CRT) were 82.8%, 70.1%, and 18.5% in resectable, borderline resectable, and locally advanced disease, respectively, at post-CRT CT (p < 0.001). • For post-CRT borderline resectable disease, ≥ 50% decrease in carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 was significantly associated with R0 resection. • For post-CRT locally advanced disease, small post-CRT tumor size ≤ 2 cm and decreased tumor-arterial contact were significantly associated with R0 resection.
