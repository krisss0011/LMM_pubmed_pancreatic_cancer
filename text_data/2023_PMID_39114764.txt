INTRODUCTION: Lenvatinib (dosing for patients who weigh ≥60 kg was 12 mg/day; 
for patients who weigh <60 kg, the dose was 8 mg/day) plus pembrolizumab 200 mg 
once every 3 weeks demonstrated antitumor activity and a manageable safety 
profile in patients with first-line unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC) 
in the open-label phase 1b Study 116/KEYNOTE-524 (primary analysis data cutoff 
date: October 31, 2019; median follow-up: 10.6 months). This analysis (updated 
data cutoff date: March 31, 2021) reports efficacy results from 17 months of 
additional follow-up time.
METHODS: 100 patients with uHCC were included in the primary analysis (median 
follow-up: 27.6 months). Endpoints included overall survival (OS), 
investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate 
(ORR), and duration of response (DOR) per modified RECIST. Landmark analyses of 
OS by the best response at 3 and 9 months were performed. Pembrolizumab antidrug 
antibodies (ADAs) and concentrations were also measured (cutoff date: August 7, 
2020).
RESULTS: ORR was 43.0% (95% CI 33.1-53.3%) and median DOR was 17.1 months (95% 
CI 6.9-19.3 months). Median PFS and OS were 9.3 months (95% CI 7.4-9.8 months) 
and 20.4 months (95% CI 14.4-25.9 months), respectively. No treatment-emergent 
ADAs were detected.
CONCLUSION: Results show a sustained treatment effect with lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab in patients with uHCC in the first-line setting.
