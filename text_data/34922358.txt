Context:Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is a rare inherited endocrine cancer syndrome. Multiple gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) affect 30% to 80% of MEN1 patients, with the most common functioning GEP-NET being gastrinoma. Biochemical identification of hypergastrinemia may help to recognize the presence of gastrinomas before they are detectable by instrumental screening, enabling early diagnosis and start of therapy, preferably before tumor progression and metastases occurrence.Objective:Evaluate the effectiveness of secretin stimulation test to precociously diagnose the presence of gastrin-secreting tumors.Design:Results of secretin stimulation tests, performed between 1991 and February 2020, were retrospectively analyzed, as aggregate, in a cohort of MEN1 patients with GEP-NETs.Setting:Data were extracted from the MEN1 Florentine database.Patients:The study included 72 MEN1 patients with GEP-NETs who underwent a secretin stimulation test for the evaluation of gastrin secretion.Outcomes:A positive secretin stimulation test was assumed with a difference between basal fasting serum gastrin (FSG) and the maximum stimulated value of gastrin over 120 pg/mL.Results:The secretin stimulation test showed a secretin-induced hypergastrinemia in 27.8% (20/72) of patients with GEP-NETs, and a positive test in 18 cases. The test allowed the identification of a positively stimulated hypergastrinemia in 75.0% (3/4) of patients who presented a basal FSG within the normal range.Conclusions:Diagnosis of gastrinoma is complex, difficult, and controversial. Results of this study confirm that a positive secretin stimulation test allows early diagnosis of gastrinomas, even in the presence of borderline or normal levels of nonstimulated FSG.
