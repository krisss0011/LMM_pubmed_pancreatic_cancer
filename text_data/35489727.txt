Background:Pancreatic cancer is one of the most recalcitrant cancers, and more effective therapy is needed. Pre-clinical studies have shown that patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) mouse models of pancreatic cancer are effectively treated with oral recombinant methioninase (o-rMETase).Case report:A 62-year-old woman diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer was treated with the combination of 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatinum (FOLFIRINOX) every two weeks and o-rMETase twice a day as a supplement. The patient was also on a low-methionine diet. Disease progression was monitored by CA19-9 and computed tomography. The patient initially responded to FOLFIRINOX, shown by a great reduction in CA19-9 levels, with tumor shrinkage shown by computed tomography. The patient began taking o-rMETase and went on a low-methionine diet one year after diagnosis which she has maintained without side effects for 7 months. The patient's CA19-9 level and tumor size remain stable 19 months after diagnosis. The patient is alive and has maintained a high performance status. Historical data show that less than 5% of stage IV pancreatic-cancer patients on FOLFIRINOX have stable disease 1.5 years after diagnosis.Conclusion:The combination of o-rMETase and FOLFIRINOX may be synergistic in stage IV pancreatic cancer.
