Pancreatic head cancer is a highly fatal disease. For now, surgery offers the only potential long-term cure albeit with a high risk of complications. However, the progress of surgical technique during the past decade has resulted in 5-year survival approaching 30% after resection and adjuvant chemotherapy. This paper presents current data on the recommended extent of lymphadenectomy, the resection margin, on the definition of resectable and borderline resectable tumors and mesopancreas. Surgical techniques proposed to improve PD are presented: the artery first approach, the uncinate process first, the mesopancreas first approach, the triangle operation, periarterial divestment, and multiorgan resection.
