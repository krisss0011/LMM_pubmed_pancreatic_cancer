Background:Palliative biliary drainage in patients with unresectable malignant biliary obstruction (MBO) frequently leads to biliary stent infection (BI), which could impact medical care. The aim of this study was to assess the risk factors for BI occurrence in patients after stenting procedure and the impact of BI on patient survival.Methods:All consecutive patients hospitalized from 2014 to 2018 for MBO and biliary stenting were retrospectively included. Demographic, clinical, and microbiological characteristics of each BI episode during a 1-year follow-up were described. Documented BI was defined as the association of BI episode and confirmed blood stream infection (BSI). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate risk factors for the first BI occurrence.Results:Among 180 patients, 56% were men (mean age of 69Â±12), and 54% have pancreatic cancer, 16% biliary cancer, 2% hepatic cancer, and 28% lymph node or metastatic compression; metallic stent was placed in 92%. A total of 113 BI episodes occurred in 74 patients, 55% of the first episodes occurring within 3 months after stenting. BI was documented in 56% of the episodes. Enterobacteriaceae were the most frequent pathogens found, while no yeasts were documented. Mortality rate in patients with BI was 64%. Multivariate analysis showed a significant difference in BI occurrence for two criteria: WHO score 3-4 (OR=8.79 [1.79-42.89]; p=0.007) and transpapillary stenting location (OR=3.72 [1.33-10.44]; p=0.013).Conclusion:Since transpapillary stenting is a risk factor for BI, preserving the papilla as much as possible is a priority so as to avoid BI.
