Background:The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of medicaid expansion (ME) on receipt of palliative therapies in metastatic pancreatic cancer patients.Patients and methods:A difference-in-differences (DID) approach was used to analyze patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer identified from the National Cancer Database diagnosed during two time periods: pre-expansion (2010-2012) and post-expansion (2014-2016). Patients diagnosed while residing in ME states were compared with those in non-ME states. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of receipt of palliative therapies.Results:Of 87,738 patients overall, 7483(18.1%) received palliative therapies in the pre-expansion, while 10,211(21.5%) received palliative therapies in the post-expansion period. In the pre-expansion period, treatment at a high-volume facility (HVF) (odds ratio [OR] 1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.18) and non-west geographic location were predictive of increased palliative therapies. In the post-expansion period, treatment at an HVF (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.02-1.16), geographic location, and living in an ME state at the time of diagnosis (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.06-1.22) were predictive of increased palliative therapies. Older age, highest quartile median income (zip-code based), and treatment at a nonacademic facility were independently associated with decreased palliative therapies in both periods. DID analysis demonstrated that patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer living in ME states had increased receipt of palliative therapies relative to those in non-ME states (DID = 2.68, p < 0.001).Conclusions:The overall utilization of palliative therapies in metastatic pancreatic cancer is low. Multiple sociodemographic disparities exist in the receipt of palliative therapies. ME is associated with increased receipt of palliative therapies in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.
