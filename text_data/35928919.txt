A diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is one of the worst cancers that may be received anywhere in the world; the five-year survival rate is very less. The majority of cases of this condition may be traced back to pancreatic cancer. Due to medical image scans, a significant number of cancer patients are able to identify abnormalities at an earlier stage. The expensive cost of the necessary gear and infrastructure makes it difficult to disseminate the technology, putting it out of the reach of a lot of people. This article presents detection of pancreatic cancer in CT scan images using machine PSO SVM and image processing. The Gaussian elimination filter is utilized during the image preprocessing stage of the removal of noise from images. TheKmeans algorithm uses a partitioning technique to separate the image into its component parts. The process of identifying objects in an image and determining the regions of interest is aided by image segmentation. The PCA method is used to extract important information from digital photographs. PSO SVM, naive Bayes, and AdaBoost are the algorithms that are used to perform the classification. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the PSO SVM algorithm are better.
