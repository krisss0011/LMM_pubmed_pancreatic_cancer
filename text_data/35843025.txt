Background:It is not clear whether archived cytological specimens (ACSs) obtained with endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) with rapid onsite evaluation (ROSE) can be used for genomic profiling of tumors. We used ACSs to perform genomic analysis of specimens to identify oncogenic and druggable mutations.Methods:A panel of 60 significantly mutated genes specific to pancreatobiliary cancer was created and used for genomic analysis of 113 specimens of 44 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues and 69 ACSs obtained by EUS-FNA with ROSE were included. The quantity and quality of DNA extracted from FFPE tissues and ACSs were compared. We also compared DNA from spray and touch ACSs. Next, genomic profiles were compared. We also evaluated detection of target gene mutations in each specimen.Results:The amount of DNA in FFPE tissues was greater than in ACSs (P = 0.014), but the quality of DNA was comparable (P = 0.378). There was no quantitative or qualitative difference between spray and touch ACSs (P = 0.154 and P = 0.734, respectively). Oncogenic mutations were shared at 82 % in FFPE tissues and ACSs and 82 % in spray and touch ACSs. The sensitivity of genomic analysis in ACSs was 97 % (67 of 69), which was comparable to that of cytology (62 of 69, 90 %; P = 0.165), and was significantly higher than that of histology (32/44, 73 %; P < 0.001). Drug-matched mutations were identified in five of the 44 lesions (11 %).Conclusion:Genomic analysis of ACSs is useful in the prognosis of pancreatic cancer because detection of driver mutations is similar to detection in FFPE tissues.
