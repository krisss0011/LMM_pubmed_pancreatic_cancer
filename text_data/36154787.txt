Current indications for radiotherapy in pancreatic cancer vary by surgical resectability status of the tumor. Radiation is generally not used pre-operatively for resectable tumors, but may be given adjuvantly particularly in settings of a close or positive surgical margin. For borderline resectable tumors, pre-operative radiation has been shown to improve surgical parameters including lowering nodal positivity and positive margin rates. For locally advanced unresectable tumors, radiation can improve local control, give patients an interval off of chemotherapy and provide symptomatic relief. Multidisciplinary discussion is critical for choosing the best modality and sequencing of care for patients with pancreatic cancer. Prospective trials with appropriately chosen endpoints and meticulous radiotherapy quality assurance are needed to best define populations with pancreatic cancer most likely to benefit from radiotherapy.
