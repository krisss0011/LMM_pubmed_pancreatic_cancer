This article provides an overview of the metaanalyzes (PubMed, 19952019) of alcohol and non-alcoholic (coffee, tea, dairy products) beverage consumption in relation to risk of pancreatic cancer PC (PubMed, 19952019). Increased the PC risk was associated with high alcohol intake. The increased risk for heavy drinking did not explained by residual confounding by history of pancreatitis or tobacco smoking or diabetes. Light-moderate alcohol intake may reduced the PC risk, probably due to the fasting insulin levels decrement, which leads to the diminished the РС risk. The association between alcohol and the PC was stronger in men than in women. Some metaanalyzes demonstrated that a small amount of coffee may reduce PC risk, and a large amount to increase PC risk. Another meta-analyzes have not confirmed any association between the PC risk and coffee or tea consumption. One meta-analysis revealed a direct association of the PC risk with the dairy products consumption, but most research showed no such connection. Nutrition is considered to be associated with the PC risk, but the degree of risk due to structure of beverages consumption (dose, duration, alcohol, coffee, tea, dairy products pattern) is still not clear.
