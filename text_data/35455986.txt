Background:Aquaporins are membrane channels responsible for the bidirectional transfer of water and small non-charged solutes across cell membranes. AQP3 and AQP5 are overexpressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, playing key roles in cell migration, proliferation, and invasion. Here, we evaluated AQP3 and AQP5 involvement in cell biomechanical properties, cell-cell adhesion, and cell migration, following a loss-of-function strategy on BxPC-3 cells.Results:Silencing of AQP3 and AQP5 was functionally validated by reduced membrane permeability and had implications on cell migration, slowing wound recovery. Moreover, silenced AQP5 and AQP3/5 cells showed higher membrane fluidity. Biomechanical and morphological changes were assessed by atomic force microscopy (AFM), revealing AQP5 and AQP3/5 silenced cells with a lower stiffness than their control. Through cell-cell adhesion measurements, the work (energy) necessary to detach two cells was found to be lower for AQP-silenced cells than control, showing that these AQPs have implications on cell-cell adhesion.Conclusion:These findings highlight AQP3 and AQP5 involvement in the biophysical properties of cell membranes, whole cell biomechanical properties, and cell-cell adhesion, thus having potential implication in the settings of tumor development.
