Background:Irreversible electroporation (IRE) expands the surgical options for patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. This study evaluated for differences in survival stratified by type of IRE and receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy.Methods:Patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer treated by IRE (2012-2020) were retrospectively included. Overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were compared by type of IRE (in situ for local tumor control or IRE of potentially positive margins with resection) and by receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy.Results:Thirty-nine patients had IRE in situ, 61 had IRE for margin extension, and 19 received adjuvant chemotherapy. Most (97.00%) underwent induction chemotherapy. OS was 28.71 months (interquartile range [IQR] 19.17, 51.19) from diagnosis, with no difference by IRE type (hazard ratio [HR] 1.05 for margin extension [p = 0.85]) or adjuvant chemotherapy (HR 1.14 [p = 0.639]). RFS was 8.51 months (IQR 4.95, 20.17) with no difference by IRE type (HR 0.90 for margin extension [p = 0.694]) or adjuvant chemotherapy (HR 0.90 [p = 0.711]).Conclusion:These findings suggest that adjuvant therapy may have limited benefit for patients treated with induction chemotherapy followed by local control with IRE for unresectable pancreatic cancer. Further study of the duration and timing of systemic therapy is warranted to maximize benefit and limit toxicity.
