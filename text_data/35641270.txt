Background/aim:Recently, protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 3 (PTPN3) has gained attention. However, the role of PTPN3 in cancer has not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we analyzed the role of PTPN3 in pancreatic cancer and investigated whether PTPN3 could be a new therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer.Materials and methods:Two pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell lines were used as target cells. Cell proliferation was investigated using cell counting and a xenograft mouse model. Migration and invasion were analyzed using Transwell inserts. Activation-related signaling molecules were examined by western blotting.Results:PTPN3 contributes to the proliferation, migration, and invasion of PDAC cells in vitro. PTPN3 promotes tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model, an action mediated partially through the MAPK pathway.Conclusion:PTPN3 could be a new therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer.
