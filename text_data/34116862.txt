Background:s As a curative surgical procedure for pancreatic neck-body cancer with invasion to celiac artery (CA), the security and efficacy of distal pancreatectomy (DP) with en bloc resection of the celiac artery (DP-CAR) remain controversial. The purpose of this study was to identify the postoperative outcomes of DP-CAR.Methods:A retrospectively analysis between January 2010 and January2019 was performed in a single center. 21 patients who underwent DP-CAR and 71 patients who underwent traditional DP for pancreatic neck-body cancer were included. Postoperative morbidity, mortality, overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were evaluated.Results:There were no significant differences in major complications and mortality between two groups. The patients in DP-CAR group had more T4 tumor (61.9 vs 7.0%, P < 0.001). DP-CAR group had similar R0 resection compared with DP group (71.4% vs 87.3%, P = 0.090). The patients in DP-CAR group suffered more gastric ulcer, DGE and elevated levels of postoperative hepatic enzymes. OS (27.4 vs 32.6 months) and DFS (14.9 vs 19.5 months) between DP-CAR and DP groups were comparative (P = 0.305; P = 0.065).Conclusions:For the patients who had pancreatic neck-body cancer with invasion to CA, DP-CAR is safety and could achieve satisfactory R0 resection, OS, and DFS.
