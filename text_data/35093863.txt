Background/aim:The aim of this study was to investigate surgical and oncological outcomes of minimally invasive (MI) and open radical antegrade modular pancreatosplenectomy (RAMPS) for the treatment of left-sided pancreatic cancer.Materials and methods:A systematic literature search and meta-analyses were performed focusing on short-term surgical oncology of MI- and open-RAMPS.Results:A total of seven studies with 423 patients were included in this review. The equivalent short-term and long-term outcomes of the groups were confirmed. The results of meta-analyses found no significant difference in R0 resection rates (OR=1.78, 95%CI=0.76-4.15, p=0.18), although MI-RAMPS was associated with a smaller number of dissected lymph nodes (MD=-3.14, 95%CI=-4.75 - -1.53, p<0.001) and lymph node metastases (OR=0.55, 95%CI=0.31-0.97, p=0.04).Conclusion:MI-RAMPS could provide surgically and oncologically feasible outcomes for well-selected left-sided pancreatic cancer as compared to open-RAMPS. However, further high-level evidence should be needed to confirm survival benefits following MI-RAMPS.
