The current performance of nature compounds in antitumor field is gradually attracted more and more attention, we discovered a nature active ingredient alizarin possess potent natural reductive NF-κB activity to against pancreatic cancer. However, the preclinical pharmacology and therapeutic effect, and the underlying mechanisms of alizarin in inhibiting pancreatic cancer are still unclear. After high-throughput screening, this is the first report that alizarin can induce a potent inhibitory effect against pancreatic cancer cells. Alizarin induced cell cycle arrest and promoted cell apoptosis by inhibiting TNF-α-stimulated NF-κB activity and nuclear translocation, and inactivated its related TNF-α-TAK1-NF-κB signaling cascade followed by downregulation of NF-κB target genes involved in cell apoptosis (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, XIAP) and in the cell cycle and growth (cyclin D, c-myc). Due to the abrogation of NF-κB activity, combination of alizarin and gemcitabine exerted a better inhibitory effect on pancreatic cancer. In summary, natural component alizarin, inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosisin vitroandin vivothrough targeting of the NF-κB signaling cascade with minimal toxicity, which combine with gemcitabine, can significantly enhance the antitumor capability, playing a synergistic effect. Therefore, alizarin may play a role in reversing gemcitabine resistance caused by overactivated NF-κB in clinical application in the future.
