Smad4, a key mediator of the transforming growth factor-Î² signaling, is mutated or deleted in 20% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cancers and significantly affects cancer development. However, the effect of Smad4 loss on the immunogenicity and tumor immune microenvironment of PDAC is still unclear. Here, a surprising function of Smad4 in suppressing mouse PDAC tumor immunogenicity is identified. Although Smad4 deletion in tumor cells enhances proliferation in vitro, the in vivo growth of Smad4-deficient PDAC tumor is significantly inhibited on immunocompetent C57BL/6 (B6) mice, but not on immunodeficient mice or CD8+cell-depleted B6 mice. Mechanistically, Smad4 deficiency significantly increases tumor cell immunogenicity by promoting spontaneous DNA damage and stimulating STING-mediated type I interferon signaling,which contributes to the activation of type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1) and subsequent CD8+T cells for tumor control. Furthermore, retarded tumor growth of Smad4-deficient PDAC cells on B6 mice is largely reversed when Sting is codeleted, or when the cells are implanted into interferon-alpha receptor-deficientmice or cDC1-deficientmice. Accordingly, Smad4 deficiency promotes PDAC immunogenicity by inducing tumor-intrinsic DNA damage-elicited type I interferon signaling.
