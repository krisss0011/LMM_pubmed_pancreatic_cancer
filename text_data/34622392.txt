A missense variant (p.Ser428Phe [S428F]) in the CHEK2 gene is reportedly associated with a 2-3 fold increase in breast cancer risk in Ashkenazi Jews. This study aimed to re-evaluate cancer risks conferred by the CHEK2 S428F variant in Ashkenazi Jews. De-identified data from CHEK2 S428F variant carriers sequenced with multigene panels were analyzed. Overall, 486/341,531 (0.14%) cases of all ethnicities diagnosed with any cancer type were CHEK2 S428F carriers, of whom 243/9980 self-identified as Ashkenazi Jews and carried this risk variant only. Compared with ethnically matched non-cancer controls, across all cancer cases, this variant was not more prevalent (p = 0.271). Specifically, variant prevalence was not different in breast cancer cases compared with controls. Though the variant was shown to be enriched in pancreatic cancer cases (p = 0.008), sample size was small. The CHEK2 S428F variant was not overrepresented in Ashkenazi Jews with breast cancer and most other cancer types analyzed, except for pancreatic cancer, compared with ethnically matched non- cancer controls. These findings should prompt reevaluating ethnic-specific CHEK2 S428F cancer attributable risk.
