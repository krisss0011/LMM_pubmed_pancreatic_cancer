Purpose:In this study, we investigate the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the clinical evaluation of gating treatment robustness in carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT) of pancreatic cancer. Indeed, MRI allows radiation-free repeated scans and fast dynamic sequences for time-resolved (TR) imaging (cine-MRI), providing information on inter- and intra-fraction cycle-to-cycle variations of respiratory motion. MRI can therefore support treatment planning and verification, overcoming the limitations of the current clinical standard, that is, four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT), which describes an "average" breathing cycle neglecting breathing motion variability.Methods:We integrated a technique to generate a virtual CT (vCT) from 3D MRI with a method for 3D reconstruction from 2D cine-MRI, to produce TR vCTs for dose recalculations. For eight patients, the method allowed evaluating inter-fraction variations at end-exhale and intra-fraction cycle-to-cycle variability within the gating window in terms of tumor displacement and dose to the target and organs at risk.Results:The median inter-fraction tumor motion was in the range 3.33-12.16 mm, but the target coverage was robust (-0.4% median D95%variation). Concerning cycle-to-cycle variations, the gating technique was effective in limiting tumor displacement (1.35 mm median gating motion) and corresponding dose variations (-3.9% median D95%variation). The larger exposure of organs at risk (duodenum and stomach) was caused by inter-fraction motion, whereas intra-fraction cycle-to-cycle dose variations were limited.Conclusions:This study proposed a method for the generation of TR vCTs from MRI, which enabled an off-line evaluation of gating treatment robustness and suggested its feasibility to support treatment planning of pancreatic tumors in CIRT.
