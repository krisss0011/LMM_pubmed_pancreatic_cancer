Despite recent advances, the prognosis of pancreatic adenocarcinomas remains poor, even for patients with resectable tumors. For these latter, new approaches based on neoadjuvant treatment have been developed. Two components are used: chemotherapy and radiation therapy (RT). Indeed, pre-operative RT has many advantages in terms of efficacy and tolerance. It increases notably the chances of subsequent complete tumor resection. Several prospective trials are currently ongoing to clarify its place in the therapeutic arsenal. Another crucial question is to know which is the best RT technique: conventional normofractionated chemoradiotherapy or hypofrationated stereotactic body RT?
