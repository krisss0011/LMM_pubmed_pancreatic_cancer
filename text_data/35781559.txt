Sphingolipid metabolism plays an important role in the formation of cellular membranes and is associated with malignant potential and chemosensitivity of cancer cells. Sphingolipid degradation depends on multiple lysosomal glucosidases. We focused on acid Î²-glucosidase (GBA), a lysosomal enzyme the deficiency of which is related to mitochondrial dysfunction. We analyzed the function of GBA in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Human PDAC cell lines (PANC-1, BxPC-3 and AsPC-1) were examined under conditions of GBA knockdown via the short interfering RNA (siRNA) method. We assessed the morphological changes, GBA enzyme activity, GBA protein expression, cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and mitophagy flux of PDAC cells. The GBA protein level and enzyme activity differed among cell lines. GBA knockdown suppressed cell proliferation and induced apoptosis, especially in PANC-1 and BxPC-3 cells, with low GBA enzyme activity. GBA knockdown also decreased the MMP and impaired mitochondrial clearance. This impaired mitochondrial clearance further induced dysfunctional mitochondria accumulation and ROS generation in PDAC cells, inducing apoptosis. The antiproliferative effects of the combination of GBA suppression and gemcitabine were higher than those of gemcitabine alone. These results showed that GBA suppression exerts a significant antitumor effect and may have therapeutic potential in the clinical treatment of PDAC.
