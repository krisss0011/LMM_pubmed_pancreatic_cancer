Purpose:In a prospective multicenter study, gemcitabine monotherapy followed by stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) was well tolerated with outcomes comparable to chemoradiation for locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). Recent trials have reported improved survival with multiagent chemotherapy (MA-CTX) alone. This prospective trial explored whether SBRT could be safely delivered after MA-CTX. Herein, we report the long-term outcomes of adding SBRT after MA-CTX in LAPC patients and evaluate whether genetic profiles of specimens obtained before SBRT influence outcomes.Methods and materials:This prospective nonrandomized controlled phase 2 trial enrolled 44 LAPC and 4 locally recurrent patients after multidisciplinary evaluation between 2012 and 2015 at a high-volume pancreatic cancer center. For induction CTX, most received modified FOLFIRINOX (mFFX), or gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (GnP) followed by 5-fraction SBRT for all. During fiducial placement, biopsies were obtained with DNA extracted for targeted sequencing using the Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets platform.Results:Median induction CTX duration was ≥4 months, and 31 patients received mFFX (65%). Among 44 LAPC patients, 17 (39%) were surgically explored, and 12 of 16 (75%) achieved a R0 resection. Median overall survival (mOS) was 20.2 and 14.6 months from diagnosis and SBRT, respectively. One- and 2-year OS from SBRT was 58% and 28%. The mOS after resection was 28.6 and 22.4 months from diagnosis and SBRT, respectively. Median local progression-free survival was 23.9 and 15.8 months from diagnosis and SBRT, respectively. The mOS for pre-SBRT CA 19-9 ≤180 U/mL versus >180 was 23.1 and 11.3 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.53; P = .04). Only 1 patient (2.1%) had late grade ≥2 gastrointestinal toxic effects attributable to SBRT. Despite significant pretreatment with chemotherapy, 88% of tumor specimens were effectively sequenced; survival outcomes were not significantly associated with specific mutational patterns. Quality of life was prospectively collected pre- and post-SBRT with the EORTC QLQ-C30 and PAN26 questionnaires showing no significant change.Conclusions:SBRT was safely administered with MA-CTX with minimal toxicity. A high proportion of LAPC patients underwent R0 resection with favorable survival outcomes.
