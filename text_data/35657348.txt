This phase I/II study evaluated the safety and efficacy of a new histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, ivaltinostat, in combination with gemcitabine and erlotinib for advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Patients diagnosed with unresectable, histologically confirmed PDAC who had not undergone previous therapy were eligible. Phase I had a 3 + 3 dose escalation design to determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of ivaltinostat (intravenously on days 1, 8 and 15) with gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2intravenously on days 1, 8 and 15) and erlotinib (100 mg/day, orally) for a 28-day cycle. In phase II, patients received a six-cycle treatment with the MTD of ivaltinostat determined in phase I. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR) and progression-free survival (PFS). The MTD of ivaltinostat for the phase II trial was determined to be 250 mg/m2. In phase II, 24 patients were enrolled. The median OS and PFS were 8.6 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.3-11.2) and 5.3 months (95% CI: 3.7-5.8). Of the 16 patients evaluated for response, ORR and DCR were 25.0% and 93.8% with a median OS/PFS of 10.8 (95% CI: 8.3-16.7)/5.8 (95% CI: 4.6-6.7) months. Correlative studies showed that mutation burden detected by cfDNA and specific blood markers such as TIMP1, pro-MMP10, PECAM1, proMMP-2 and IGFBP1 were associated with clinical outcomes. Although the result of a small study, a combination of ivaltinostat, gemcitabine and erlotinib appeared to be a potential treatment option for advanced PDAC.
