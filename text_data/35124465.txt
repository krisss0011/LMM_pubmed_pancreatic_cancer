Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI) is a common condition in patients with pancreatic cancer (PC). PEI can be due to the tumor, which, if located in the head, causes obstruction of the pancreatic duct with subsequent atrophy of the pancreatic parenchyma, or it can be the consequence of pancreatic surgical resection. The standard treatment of PEI is pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT). Clinical data to support the use of PERT in PC are however limited. There are very few randomized clinical trials that evaluated PERT in PC. Most data come from observational studies. Despite this limited clinical evidence, PERT treatment for PEI is an essential part of supportive therapy to ensure optimal nutritional status in PC patients who will receive surgery, neoadjuvant/adjuvant or palliative treatment. The objective of this review is to increase the awareness about PEI in PC patients and to provide expert recommendations on the use of PERT in resected, borderline resectable and unresectable patients, based on clinical experience and literature review.
