Transcriptomic analysis of cancer samples helps identify the mechanism and molecular markers of cancer. However, transcriptomic analyses of pancreatic cancer from the Japanese population are lacking. Hence, in this study, we performed RNA sequencing of fresh and frozen pancreatic cancer tissues from 12 Japanese patients to identify genes critical for the clinical pathology of pancreatic cancer among the Japanese population. Additionally, we performed immunostaining of 107 pancreatic cancer samples to verify the results of RNA sequencing. Bioinformatics analysis of RNA sequencing data identified ITGB1 (Integrin beta 1) as an important gene for pancreatic cancer metastasis, progression, and prognosis. ITGB1 expression was verified using immunostaining. The results of RNA sequencing and immunostaining showed a significant correlation (r = 0.552, p = 0.118) in ITGB1 expression. Moreover, the ITGB1 high-expression group was associated with a significantly worse prognosis (p = 0.035) and recurrence rate (p = 0.028). We believe that ITGB1 may be used as a drug target for pancreatic cancer in the future.
