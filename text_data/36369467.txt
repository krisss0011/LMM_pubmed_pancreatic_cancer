Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most malignant tumors. Rapid progression and distant metastasis are the main causes of patient death. Hypoxia is a hallmark of multiple cancers and is involved in tumor biology. However, little is known about the roles of circRNAs in glycolysis and hypoxia-mediated progression of PC. Here, the expression pattern of hypoxia-related circRNAs was analyzed using RNA sequencing. A unique circRNA termed circRNF13 was found to be upregulated in PC tissues and may be a potential prognostic indicator. HIF-1α and EIF4A3 are involved in regulating the biogenesis of circRNF13. Furthermore, circRNF13 was validated to exert a stimulative effect on cell proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion and glycolysis. Importantly, we found that circRNF13 promoted PDK3 levels by acting as a miR-654-3p sponge, thus promoting the PC malignant process. Collectively, our results reveal that hypoxia-induced circRNF13 mediated by HIF-1α and EIF4A3 promotes tumor progression and glycolysis in PC, indicating the potential of circRNF13 as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for PC.
