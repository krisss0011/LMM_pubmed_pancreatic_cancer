OBJECTIVES: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by occult 
onset, rapid progression, and poor prognosis. CXC chemokines play an important 
role in tumor microenvironment and development. However, the potential 
mechanistic values of CXC chemokines as clinical biomarkers and therapeutic 
targets in PDAC have not been fully clarified.
METHODS: The altered expression, interaction network, and clinical data of CXC 
chemokines in patients with PDAC were analyzed by the data from the Gene 
Expression Omnibus and the Tumor Cancer Genome Atlas.
RESULTS: CXCL5 transcriptional level was significantly elevated in PDAC tissues. 
A significant correlation was found between the expression of CXC1/3/5/8 and the 
pathological stage of PDAC patients. The PDAC patients with low transcriptional 
levels of CXCL5/9/10/11/17 were associated with a significantly better 
prognosis. The functions of differentially expressed CXC chemokines are 
primarily related to the chemokine signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor 
interaction, and viral protein interaction with cytokine and cytokine receptor. 
RELA, NFKB1, and SP1 are key transcription factors for CXC chemokines, and the 
SRC family of tyrosine kinases, mitogen-activated protein kinases, CDK5, PRKCQ, 
ROCK1, ITK, IKBKE, JAK3, and NTRK2 are CXC chemokine targets.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that CXC chemokines might serve as 
therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers in PDAC.
