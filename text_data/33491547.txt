Purpose/aim:Diabetic chorea is a rare movement disorder associated with diabetes mellitus. We report the case of a patient that benefited from pimozide and died of pancreatic cancer.Case report:A 70-year-old woman presented with pollakiuria and involuntary movements of left limbs since three months. Laboratory tests revealed high serum levels of glycemia and glycated haemoglobin. She was admitted to internal medicine department and discharged one week later: insulin was administered with normalization of blood glucose levels and the involuntary movements gradually disappeared. Three weeks later she was admitted to neurological department due to the recurrence of the involuntary movements. Glycemia and other routine laboratory tests were normal. Neurological examination showed choreic movements involving left limbs. MRI showed a hyperintensity on T1- and T2-weighted sequences of right putamen and caudate nucleus head. Haloperidol was administered without improvement, it was successively substituted with tetrabenazine and the patient was discharged with an unvaried clinical picture. Two months later tetrabenazine was discontinued because of inefficacy and pimozide was started. The choreic movements considerably diminished after few days. Four months later, a pancreatic cancer was diagnosed and the patient died in the same month.Conclusion:Clinical and radiological features were suggestive of diabetic chorea. Our patient benefited exclusively from pimozide, it could be reasonable to use pimozide in resistant form and also propose it as first choice treatment. Another important element is the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer some months after chorea onset: a causal link could exist.
