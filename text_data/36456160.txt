Background/aim:Combination chemotherapy with gemcitabine, nab-paclitaxel, oxaliplatin, and itraconazole (GnPO-ITC) was administered as first-line chemotherapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer (mPC). The efficacy and toxicity of these treatments were retrospectively investigated.Patients and methods:A total of 81 patients (mean age=64 years) with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1 were enrolled in the study, and administered nab-paclitaxel (125 mg/m2), gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m2), and oxaliplatin (85 mg/m2) on day 1 and itraconazole (400 mg) on days -2 to +2, repeated every 2 weeks.Results:Metastatic sites observed in patients included the liver (n=55, 68%), peritoneum (n=23, 28%), distant lymph nodes (n=24, 30%), and lungs (n=18, 22%). Within 28 days after initiation of chemotherapy, 15 patients (19%) experienced common â‰¥3 grade hematological adverse events. The major reason for discontinuation of treatment among the responders was peripheral sensory neuropathy in 36 patients (44%). The overall response rate to treatment was 64% [95% confidence interval (CI)=54-75%]. The median progression-free survival and median overall survival were 8.3 months (95% CI=6.8-9.8 months) and 14.4 months (95% CI=11.4-17.3 months), respectively. Among the 52 responders, 24 (46%) underwent conversion surgery, which did not improve survival (p=0.279). Second-line treatment with irinotecan was required in 71 (88%) patients. Hepatic arterial chemotherapy and radiotherapy were administered to 33 (41%) and 27 (33%) patients, respectively.Conclusion:The GnPO-ITC regimen showed promising efficacy with manageable toxicities for controlling disease progression and improving overall survival.
