New findings (Krishnamurty et al.) implicate a subset of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) that express leucine-rich repeat containing 15 (LRRC15) in promoting tumor growth in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC), by suppressing the antitumor immunity of cytotoxic T cells. Genetic ablation of LRRC15+ CAFs resulted in better response to immune checkpoint blockade, suggesting they may be a novel target for therapy.
