Objective:We performed genome-wide expression profiling to develop an exosomal miRNA panel for predicting recurrence following surgery in patients with PDAC.Summary of background data:Pretreatment risk stratification is essential for offering individualized treatments to patients with PDAC, but predicting recurrence following surgery remains clinically challenging.Methods:We analyzed 210 plasma and serum specimens from 4 cohorts of PDAC patients. Using a discovery cohort (n = 25), we performed genome-wide sequencing to identify candidate exosomal miRNAs (exo-miRNAs). Subsequently, we trained and validated the predictive performance of the exo-miRNAs in two clinical cohorts (training cohort: n = 82, validation cohort: n = 57) without neoadjuvant therapy (NAT), followed by a post-NAT clinical cohort (n = 46) as additional validation.Results:We performed exo-miRNA expression profiling in plasma specimens obtained before any treatment in a discovery cohort. Subsequently we optimized and trained a 6-exo-miRNA risk-prediction model, which robustly discriminated patients with recurrence [area under the curve (AUC): 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.70-0.89] and relapse-free survival (RFS, P < 0.01) in the training cohort. The identified exo-miRNA panel was successfully validated in an independent validation cohort (AUC: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.65- 0.88, RFS: P < 0.01), where it exhibited comparable performance in the post-NAT cohort (AUC: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.57-0.85, RFS: P < 0.01) and emerged as an independent predictor for RFS (hazard ratio: 2.84, 95% CI: 1.30-6.20).Conclusions:We identified a novel, noninvasive exo-miRNA signature that robustly predicts recurrence following surgery in patients with PDAC; highlighting its potential clinical impact for optimized patient selection and improved individualized treatment strategies.
