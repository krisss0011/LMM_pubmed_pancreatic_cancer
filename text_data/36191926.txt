Pancreatic cancer is one of the leading causes for cancer-related deaths in the United States. Majority of patients present with unresectable or metastatic disease. For those that present with localized disease, a multidisciplinary approach is necessary to maximize survival and optimize outcomes. The quality and safety of surgery for pancreatic cancer have improved in recent years with increasing adoption of minimally invasive techniques and surgical adjuncts. Systemic chemotherapy has also evolved to impact survival. It is now increasingly being utilized in the neoadjuvant setting, often with concomitant radiation. Increased utilization of genomic testing in metastatic pancreatic cancer has led to better understanding of their biology, thereby allowing clinicians to consider potential targeted therapies. Similarly, targeted agents such as PARP inhibitors and immune checkpoint- inhibitors have emerged with promising results. In summary, pancreatic cancer remains a disease with poor long-term survival. However, recent developments have led to improved outcomes and have changed practice in the past decade. This review summarizes current practices in pancreatic cancer treatment and the milestones that brought us to where we are today, along with emerging therapies.
