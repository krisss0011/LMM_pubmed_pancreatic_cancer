Background:The impact of fragmentation of care (FC), i.e., receipt of care at > 1 institution, on treatment of pancreatic cancer is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine factors associated with FC in curative-intent treatment of pancreatic cancer (PDAC) patients and evaluate how FC affects survival outcomes.Methods:Using the National Cancer Database (NCDB), data on stage I-III PDAC patients diagnosed 2006-2016 were extracted. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors predictive of FC and survival.Results:Of the 20,013 patients identified, 24.1% had FC. Factors predictive of FC were stage-III tumors (odds ratio [OR] 1.36; p = 0.014), higher median-income [third quartile (OR 1.38; p = 0.006) and highest-quartile (OR 1.50; p = 0.003)], care at high-volume facility (OR 1.47; p < 0.001), and receipt of multi-modal therapy (OR 1.69; p < 0.001). In contrast, age > 80 years (OR 0.82; p = 0.018), Black (OR 0.85; p = 0.013) or Asian race (OR 0.76; p = 0.033), Charlson comorbidity-index 2 (OR 0.85; p = 0.033), treatment at non-academic facility (OR 0.87; p = 0.041), and non-private insurance were negatively predictive of FC. FC independently predicted decreased 30-day [OR 0.57; p < 0.001] and 90-day mortality [OR 0.61; p < 0.001] and improved overall survival [hazard ratio 0.91; p < 0.001].Discussion:Sociodemographic factors are significantly associated with FC in curative-intent treatment of PDAC patients. FC was found to predict improved 30-day, 90-day, and overall survival outcomes.
