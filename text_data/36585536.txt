Background:A multimodal approach of surgery and chemotherapy, with or without radiation, is the mainstay of therapy with curative-intent for resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This study compared utilization trends and outcomes of upfront surgery with and without adjuvant therapy.Methods:The National Cancer Database was queried for patients with a diagnosis of stage 1 or 2 PDAC who underwent upfront resection. Multivariable regression was applied to identify factors associated with initiation of adjuvant therapy.Results:Of the 39,128 patients in the study, 67% initiated adjuvant therapy after resection, whereas 33% received upfront surgery alone. Receipt of adjuvant multimodal therapy increased from 59% in 2006 to 69% in 2017 (P < 0.0001). Non-white race was associated with lower odds of receiving adjuvant therapy after adjustment for income status, education attainment, and other variables (Hispanic/Spanish [odds ratio {OR}, 0.77; 95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.69-0.86] and non-Hispanic black [OR 0.84; 95% CI 0.78-0.91 vs non-Hispanic white; P < 0.001). The variables that contributed to receipt of adjuvant therapy were place of residence in high versus low education attainment area (OR 1.30; 95% CI 1.18-1.44; P < 0.0001) and lower odds for initiation of adjuvant therapy with increasing distance from the treating facility (> 50 miles [OR 0.51; 95% CI 0.47-0.54] vs <12.5 miles; P < 0.0001). The median unadjusted overall survival (OS) time was 18.2 months (95% CI 17.7-18.8 months) for upfront surgery alone and 25.3 months (95% CI 24.9-25.8 months) for surgery with adjuvant therapy.Conclusions:The patients who underwent upfront surgical resection for PDAC showed wide socioeconomic disparities in the use of adjuvant therapy independent of insurance status, facility type, or travel distance.
