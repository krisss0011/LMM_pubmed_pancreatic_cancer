Objectives:Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has revolutionized the treatment of many pancreaticobiliary conditions. However, little is known about the global practices, training programs, and credentialing of the procedure. The aim of the current study is to address the above questions.Methods:This was an international cross-sectional survey conducted between October 2020 and May 2021. Participating countries were requested to complete an online survey on ERCP services and training.Results:Eighty-nine countries responded to the survey. There were significant increases in the proportion of ERCP services provided by the government (P < 0.0001), number of endoscopists per million of population (P < 0.0001), and number of institutions per million of population (P < 0.0001) from low to high human development index (HDI). Eighteen percent of the countries offer the procedure as part of a standard training program, 68.5% do not follow a standardized training curriculum. Risk factors for higher incidence and mortality from pancreatic cancers include higher HDI category, smaller population, a larger number of endoscopists proficient in ERCP, and lower number of institutions providing ERCP training. Countries with very high HDI have four times higher incidence and mortality from pancreatic cancers as compared to those with low HDI.Conclusions:There is still an ongoing need for improving ERCP training in low to very high HDI countries. A structured training program is still lacking in many parts of the world. With increasing incidence and mortality of pancreatic cancers, particularly in high HDI countries, there is a need for further increasing facilities for ERCP training.
