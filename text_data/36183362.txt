Despite the expectation that retinoic acid receptor could be the potential therapeutic targets for pancreatic cancers, there has been the lack of information about the role and the impact of retinoic acid receptor gamma (RARÎ³, RARG) on pancreatic cancer, unlike other two RARs. Herein, we applied TCGA and GEO database to show that the expression and prognosis of RARG is closely related to pancreatic cancer, which demonstrates that RARG is commonly overexpressed in human pancreatic cancer and is an independent diagnostic marker predicting the poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients. In addition, we demonstrated that the reduction in the expression of RARG in human pancreatic cancer cells dramatically suppress their proliferation and tumor growth in vivo, partially attributable to the downregulation of tumor-supporting biological processes such as cell proliferation, antiapoptosis and metabolism and the decreased expression of various oncogenes like MYC and STAT3. Mechanistically, RARG binds on the promoters of MYC, STAT3, and SLC2A1 which is distinguished from well-known conventional Retinotic acid response elements (RAREs) and that the binding is likely to be responsible for the epigenetic activation in the level of chromatin, assessed by the measurement of deposition of the gene activation marker histone H3 K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) using ChIP-qPCR. In this study, we reveal that RARG plays important role in the tumorigenesis of pancreatic cancer and represents new therapeutic targets for human pancreatic cancer.
