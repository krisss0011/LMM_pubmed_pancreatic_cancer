Background:Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a dangerous malignancy with a high mortality rate. Diagnosing PC at an early stage is difficult, and approximately 5% of the patients survive for 5 years. Microsatellite instability (MSI) plays an important role in colorectal cancer (CRC) for prognosis and immunotherapy. Evaluation of MSI status is important as it is recognized biomarker for the positive response of immune checkpoint blockade therapy in cancer. To our knowledge, there is no report yet on the prevalence of MSI in Korean PC patients. Studies have reported conflicting prevalence of MSI in PC.Methods:Therefore, to improve the likelihood of MSI identification in PC, we included 133 patients with PC; paired tumor and normal tissue DNA were isolated and MSI was analyzed using Promega panel and immunohistochemistry (IHC) was also performed.Results:Our results from the Promega panel indicated that one (0.7%) tumor was MSI-high (MSI-H), 13 (9.8%) were MSI-low (MSI-L), and 119 (89.5%) were microsatellite stable (MSS). IHC result also confirmed dMMR in only one sample.Conclusions:The finding of low incidence of MSI-H observed by the Promega panel also matched IHC results, so this study suggested that in Korean PC patients, MSI prevalence is infrequent.
