Background:Tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) are special membrane structures for intercellular communications. Vital cargoes (such as mitochondria) could be delivered from healthy cells to rescue damaged ones through TNTs. The TNTs could be utilized for the purpose of systematic delivery of therapeutic agents between cells. However, there are insufficient studies on the controlled enhancement of TNT formations. The purpose of this study is to understand how macrophages influence the TNT formation in cancer cells.Results:Here we compared the capabilities of inducing TNTs in human pancreatic cancer cells (PANC-1) of the media conditioned by M0, M1 and M2 macrophages derived from THP-1 cells. The M0 and M1 macrophage conditioned media promoted TNT formation. Using a focused ion beam to cut through a TNT, we observed tunnel-like structures inside dense cytoskeletons with scanning electron microscopy. The TNT formation correlated with raised motility, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in the PANC-1 cells. Mitochondria and lysosomes were also found to be transported in the TNTs.Conclusions:These results suggest that TNT formation could be one of the responses to the immune stress in pancreatic cancer cells caused by M0 and M1 macrophages. This finding is valuable for the development of macrophage-targeting cancer therapy.
