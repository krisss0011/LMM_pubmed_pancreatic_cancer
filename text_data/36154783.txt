Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is associated with complex changes in body composition. Visceral obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus are established risk factors for developing PDAC; however, clinical and metabolic features of PDAC commonly lead to cancer cachexia, a hypermetabolic syndrome characterized by weight loss secondary to muscle and adipose tissue wasting. Reduction in muscle mass in patients with PDAC is associated with poorer survival in patients undergoing surgical resection and increased chemotherapy toxicity. Although no standardized treatment exists, a multidisciplinary, tailored, symptom-based approach is recommended to improve outcomes and quality of life for patients with PDAC and cachexia.
