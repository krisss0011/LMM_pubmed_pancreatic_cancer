Background and Objectives: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an
aggressive cancer with poor response to systemic therapies, including immuno-
therapy. Given the immunotherapeutic potential of natural killer (NK) cells, we
evaluated intratumoral NK cell infiltrates along with cytotoxic T cells in PDAC todetermine their association with patient outcomes.
Methods: We analyzed tumors from 93 PDAC patients treated from 2012 to 2020.
Predictor variables included tumor ‐infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), T ‐cell markers
(CD3, CD8, CD45RO), NK marker (NKp46), and NK inhibitory marker (major
histocompatibility complex class I [MHC ‐I]) by immunohistochemistry. Primary
outcome variables were recurrence ‐free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS).
Results: Mean TILs, CD3, and NKp46 scores were 1.3 ± 0.63, 20.6 ± 17.5, and
3.1 ± 3.9, respectively. Higher expression of CD3 and CD8 was associated with
higher OS, whereas NK cell infiltration was not associated with either RFS or OS.
There was a tight positive correlation between MHC ‐I expression and all T ‐cell
markers, but not with NKp46.
Conclusions: Overall NK cell infiltrates were low in PDAC and did not predict clinical
outcomes, whereas T ‐cell infiltrates did. Further characterization of the immune
infiltrate in PDAC, including inhibitory signals and suppressive cell types, may yield
better biomarkers of prognosis and immune targeting in this refractory disease.

1|INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal malignancy
which is resistant to most systemic therapies, including immuno-
therapy. Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause ofcancer related death in the United States and is projected to be
number two by 2030.1,2According to the American Cancer
Society, approximately 60 430 new cases in the United
States were diagnosed in 2021 with estimated 48 220 deaths.1
While surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment for PDAC,

approximately 80% –85% of patients present at an advanced
stage with unresectable or metastatic disease.1Moreover, the
prognosis remains poor even in the setting of surgical resection
with a 5 ‐year survival rate of only 20% for patients with localized,
resectable disease.3The dismal prognosis associated with PDAC
is multifactorial in nature, but includes advanced stage at
presentation, aggressive tumor biology, and hostile tumor micro-
environment (TME) which contr ibutes to its resistance to
chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. In fact,even successful chemotherapy regimens such as FOLFIRINOX
have only modestly improved survival rates,
4thus highlighting
the importance of examining alter native therapeutic approaches
to improve outcomes.

elimination, and progression of malignancies in the host.5Over
the last decade, immunotherapy has revolutionized clinical
oncology with breakthrough advances in multiple cancers,
including melanoma, non ‐small cell lung cancer, and renal cell
carcinoma.6–8Strategies targeting immune checkpoints, such as
cytotoxic T ‐lymphocyte ‐associated antigen 4 and programmed
death 1, have demonstrated impressive antitumor responses insolid tumors and have become a standard pillar in cancertreatment.
6,9However, not all patients respond, and some
cancers show minimal, if any, r esponse to immunotherapy. PDAC
is a prime example of an immunotherapy resistant cancer withresponse rates less than 5%.
10,11Barriers include low T ‐cell
infiltration in tumors and an immunosuppressive TME with
adverse metabolic conditions which reduce T ‐cell recruitment
and inhibit those which are present leading to exhaustion.12
Additionally, immun osuppressive PDAC environments contain
abundant desmoplastic stroma which is a mechanical barrier toimmune cell infiltration.
13–15
As a result, PDAC is characterized as a stereotypical “cold ”
tumor with low immune infiltration, particularly devoid of CD8+T
cells.16However, although PDAC has been linked to low T ‐cell
infiltrate, the contribution of nat ural killer (NK) cells has received
less attention. NK cells are a vital component of the innate
immune system and can identify and eliminate virally infected andmalignant cells without prior sensitization.
17They are cytotoxic
due to their ability to release toxic molecules such as perforin and
granzymes, forming pores in the membranes of targeted cells. NKcells also express a broad array of receptors, allowing them
respond to diverse stimuli.
17While NK cell therapies have shown
efficacy in hematologic malig nancies and are under intense
investigation to extend the pr omise of immunotherapy, they
have not been proven effective in solid tumors to date as
adoptive therapy.18However, tumor ‐infiltrating NK cells have
been associated with improv ed responses to neoadjuvant
treatments and overall prognosi s in solid tumors such as breast
cancer.19,20Given the need for novel immunotherapy approaches
in PDAC, our objective was to evaluate immune parameters inPDAC, particularly markers of NK cells, to determine if NK cell
infiltrates were associat ed with patient outcomes.2|MATERIALS AND METHODS
We performed a retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with
resectable PDAC from 2012 to 2020. Our research protocol was
approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University ofCalifornia, Davis (Protocol Number 1727704 ‐1).
2.1 |Patient clinical characteristics
We identified 93 patients with stages I to III PDAC based on the
American Joint Committee on Cancer Cancer Staging Manual, 8thedition.
21Patient demographic, clinicopathologic, and treatment data
were abstracted from the medical record, including patient age, sex,
race, tumor grade, tumor size, lymph node involvement, and receiptof chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Primary outcome variables
included recurrence ‐free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS),
analyzed by the Kaplan –Meier method. RFS and OS were defined as
described previously.
22OS was calculated as the number of months
between the date of initial diagnostic biopsy to the date of death.
RFS was calculated from the date of initial diagnostic biopsy to thedate of recurrence or the date of last follow up reported in theelectronic medical records. Date of death was established using
electronic medical records and confirmed with the California Cancer
Registry.
2.2 |Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis
Predictor variables included tumor ‐infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs),
T‐cell markers (CD3, CD8, CD45RO), NK marker (NKp46) and NK
inhibitory marker (major histocompatibility complex class I [MHC ‐I]).
Tissue microarrays (TMA) containing approximately three patient
samples per slide were constructed with 1.5 mm cores from archived
specimens, which were reviewed before TMA construction to selectareas of viable tumor.
23IHC staining was performed using mouse
anti ‐human CD3 (Abcam; clone SP7), mouse anti ‐human CD8 (Dako;
clone C8/144B), mouse anti ‐human CD45RO (Cell Signaling; clone
UCHL1), and rabbit anti ‐human NKp46/NCR1 (AbCam; clone
ERP22403 ‐57). Slides were scored by a blinded pathologist (M. A.
D.) using a scale of 0 –3 for TILs and scale of 0 –300 for immune
markers by IHC as described previously.23Staining was performed in
triplicate, and these values were averaged for statistical analysis.
Individual patient mean values of the triplicate scores were thenclassified as high or low with reference to the median score for theentire cohort for each marker, as described previously.

2.3 |Statistical analysis
Survival outcomes were compared using Kaplan –Meier curves and
log‐rank test. Correlations between variables were performed using
Spearmen correlation test. Additionally, multivariate proportional886 |

adjusted with separate models, and biomarkers were inputted into acombined model designed to assess collinearity and the impact of
confounding factors.
3|RESULTS
3.1 |Patient clinicopathologic characteristics
The clinicopathologic characteristics of our study cohort are reported
in Table 1. Mean age was 70, 55% were female, and the mean tumor
size was 3.1 ± 1.1 cm. Eighty ‐nine percent of tumors involved the
pancreatic head, and 63% were lymph node positive. In our cohort,
10% of patients received neoadjuvant therapy, and 63% receivedadjuvant therapy. However, few patients tolerated completeadjuvant therapy following surgery. With a median follow up of 27
months, the median OS for the cohort was 25 months, and themedian RFS was 23 months (Table 2).

(Figure 1A), including high and low expression of immune markers
of interest (Figure 1B).
3.3 |Association of immune infiltrates with
outcomes
We then analyzed the correlation between immune infiltrates and
clinical outcomes. A higher expression of both CD3 ( p= 0.009) and
CD8 ( p= 0.001) was associated with higher OS (Figure 2A,B ), while
neither TIL scores nor NK cell infiltrates were associated with OS(Figure 2C,D ). However, we observed that lower expression of MHC ‐
I was associated with greater OS ( p= 0.047) (Figure 2E). Memory

Additionally, none of the single color IHC immune markers nor TILs
were significantly associated with RFS (Figure 3). We did observe a
positive correlation between MHC ‐I expression and all T ‐cell
markers, CD3/MHC ‐I(r= 0.33, p= 0.001), CD8/MHC ‐I(r= 0.34,
p= 0009), and CD45RO/MHC ‐I(r= 0.49, p< 0.0001) (Figures 4A–C,
respectively). Additionally, as shown in Figure 4E, there was a
significant association between MHC ‐I expression and TILs ( r= 0.43,
p< 0.0001), while NKp46 infiltrates were not associated with MHC ‐I
expression (Figure 4E). Additionally, there was a tight correlationbetween TIL scores and CD8 expression ( r= 0.65, p< 0.0001) noted
in Table 4.

are consistent with those of ot her studies assessing immune
infiltrates in clinical PDAC specimens.16,25Historically, PDAC has
been characterized as an immune desert due to low CD8 T ‐cell
infiltration; however, NK cell infiltration has only recently been
analyzed.26Few studies have explored the association of NK cell
infiltration and survival in PDA C, and the results have generally
been inconclusive.27,28However, there are select preclinical studies
exploring the antitumor effects of NK cells for PDAC in mouse
models, showing that adoptive transfer of NK cells exhibitsantitumor activity leading to a significant delay in tumor growthin mice.
11,29,30Although it is possible that our study and others like
it are underpowered to show an association between NK infiltrates
and outcomes in PDAC surgical specimens, the discrepancy inresults between preclinical studies showing an association of NK
cells with antitumor responses in PDAC in mouse models and
retrospective analyses of human samples suggests that key speciesdifferences as well as idiosyncrasies of mouse modeling may be
impacting the generalizability of those preclinical results.Our observation that NK cell infiltrates were not significantly
associated with oncologic outcomes may also be related to several
other factors. It is possible there is a required threshold of tumor ‐
infiltrating NK cells needed to observe significant differences in
survival, and the low NK infiltrates in the tumors we analyzed may
not have met this threshold. Alternatively, inhibitory signalssuppressing NK cell function in the PDAC TME could be contributing
to the observed results. There are potential immunosuppressive
factors including intratumoral hypoxia, which is common in solidtumors such as PDAC, as well as elaboration of immunosuppressivecytokines like transforming growth factor ‐β.
31NK cells have been
shown to be less cytotoxic in hypoxic environments due to reduced
expression of NKG2D, CD107a, and granzyme B.32Additionally, the
use of NKp46 in our study as a marker for NK cells may contribute to
discrepancies with previous studies, most of which show NK cell
infiltration to be associated with improved survival using CD56 as theNK marker.
33Although CD56 is a reliable NK cell marker by flow
cytometry, by single color IHC, it can be nonspecific and stain neural
cells and other lymphoid cell types. On the other hand, althoughNKp46 is highly specific for NK cells, it may not capture all NK cells
present since it is frequently expressed at low levels in resting NK
cells.
34,35
In contrast, our data showed that T ‐cell markers, including CD3
and CD8, were associated with improved survival outcomes,
suggesting that targeting intratumoral CD3 and CD8 infiltrates in
PDAC may be a viable strategy for eliciting an immune response, ifappropriate ways to increase intratumoral T cells and prevent their
suppression can be unlocked. Notably, we did not observe an
association between TIL infiltration, as assessed by hematoxylin andeosin staining, and survival outcomes in our study. However, TIL
scoring includes multiple immune cells, all of which have variousTABLE 4 Spearman correlation coefficients between CD8, TILs,

inhibitory and activating receptors. While our IHC was performed by
a blinded pathologist, immune scoring is subjective which may impactdata obtained and therefore results. Additionally, TMAs capture a
small portion of a viable tumor. Areas with elevated inflammation are
avoided as it would significantly obscure visualization of the tumor.This may have contributed to sampling bias.
Currently, few papers have investigated MHC ‐I expression in
PDAC.
36We analyzed MHC ‐I because it is a both stimulatory
molecule for T cells and an inhibitory molecule for NK cells.37T cells
recognize antigens in the context of MHC presentation, with CD8 T
cells able to respond to tumor cells expressing MHC ‐I presenting
cognate antigen.38We observed a strong positive correlation
between MHC ‐I expression and all T ‐cell markers (CD3, CD8, and
CD45RO) which was statistically significant. Therefore, strategies to
increase MHC ‐I expression may increase T cells and ideally reverse
the PDAC immune desert. Conversely, we did not observe a
correlation of MHC ‐I expression with NK infiltration. MHC ‐I
negatively regulates NK cell activation via cytoplasmic tyrosineimmunoreceptors, such as killer ‐immunoglobulin like receptors,
therefore loss of MHC ‐I can lower the threshold for NK cell
activation.
37,39Given the inhibitory effects of MHC ‐I on NK cell
function, further studies should assess the spatial localization of NKand CD8 T cells in relation to MHC ‐I expressing cells and how this
impacts outcomes.
Although we were able to analyze a consecutive series of
surgically treated patients with translationally relevant tumor tissue,
our cohort size of 93 patients may have resulted in an underpowered
study, potentially limiting our ability to evaluate our hypothesisregarding NK infiltrates in the PDAC TME. Studies by Ino et al. and
Carsten et al. which observed an association of TIL infiltrates with
survival in PDAC included sample sizes of 132 and 241, respectively,both of which are greater than ours.
40,41In addition, there is a risk of
missing or incomplete data in population ‐based datasets, and this can
skew the data especially for potentially ambiguous endpoints such as
RFS. The lack of significant results regarding RFS and discrepancywith OS is likely due to the retrospective nature of this analysis
including patients lost to follow up. Although survival dates were
obtained from a highly validated source, the California CancerRegistry, and were likely definitive, documentation of recurrence
was much less rigorous and impacted for patients lost to follow up.
This likely biases to the null hypothesis our analysis of RFS as anoutcome variable.
5|CONCLUSION
In summary, we observed that NK cells as assessed by IHC
expression of NKp46 do not significantly correlate with survivaloutcomes in PDAC, while CD3 and CD8 expression do. This may be
the result of immunosuppressive features of the PDAC TME, such as
hypoxia and MHC ‐I expression, which inhibit NK cells. Further
characterization of the immune infiltrate in PDAC is needed for
improved prognostication and immune targeting.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
