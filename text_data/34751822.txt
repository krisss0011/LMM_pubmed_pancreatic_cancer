Background:The d evelopment of surgical techniques and specialization and specifically complication management in pancreatic surgery have improved surgical outcomes as well as oncological results in pancreatic surgery in recent decades. Historical morbidity and especially mortality rates of up to 80% have decreased to below 5% today. This review summarizes the current state of the art in pancreatic cancer surgery.Methods:The present literature and clinical experience are summarized to give an overview of the present best practice in pancreatic surgery as one of the most advanced surgical disciplines today.Results:Based on the available literature, three important aspects contribute to best patient care in pancreatic surgery, namely, surgical progress, interdisciplinary complication management, and multimodal oncological treatment in case of pancreatic cancer. In addition, minimally invasive and robotic procedures are currently fields of development and specific topics of research.Conclusion:In experienced hands, pancreatic surgery-despite being one of the most challenging fields of surgery-is a safe domain today. The impact of multimodal, especially adjuvant, therapy for oncological indications is well established and evidence-based. New technologies are evolving and will be evaluated with high-evidence studies in the near future.
