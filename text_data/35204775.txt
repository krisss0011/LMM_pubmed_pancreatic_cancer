Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common form of pancreatic cancer. In ~75% of PDAC, the tumor suppressorTP53gene is mutated. Novel approaches to treat cancer involve compounds called mutant TP53 reactivators. They interact with mutant TP53 proteins and restore some of their growth suppressive properties, but they may also interact with other proteins, e.g., TP63 and TP73. We examined the ability of the TP53 reactivator APR-246 to interact with eleven modified berberine compounds (NAX compounds) in the presence and absence of WT-TP53 in two PDAC cell lines: the MIA-PaCa-2, which has gain of function (GOF) TP53 mutations on both alleles, and PANC-28, which lacks expression of the WT TP53 protein. Our results indicate the TP53 reactivator-induced increase in therapeutic potential of many modified berberines.
