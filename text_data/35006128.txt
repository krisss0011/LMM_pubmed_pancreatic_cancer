Background:Whether epidural anesthesia and analgesia (EA) improves long-term outcomes after pancreatic cancer surgery remains controversial. We conducted this retrospective cohort study to investigate the influence of EA on cancer recurrence and overall survival after surgery for pancreatic cancer.Methods:We conducted an electronic medical chart review of patients with pancreatic cancer who underwent curative resection at our hospital from 2008 to 2017 and were followed up until December 2019. Patient demographics, anesthetic and surgical characteristics, and pathologic features were also collected. The effects of EA on postoperative cancer recurrence and overall survival were evaluated using proportional hazards regression models with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) based on propensity scores to balance unequal distributions of observed covariates. For sensitivity analysis, multivariable regression modeling and quintile-stratified propensity adjustments were also used.Results:Among the 252 included patients, the median follow-up period was 15.9 months (interquartile range 6.8-28.2 months), and 88 (35%) received EA after pancreatic cancer surgery. EA was not associated with greater cancer recurrence (IPTW adjusted HR: 0.98; 95% CI, 0.78%-1.24%; p = 0.87) or all-cause mortality (IPTW adjusted HR: 1.02; 95% CI, 0.82%-1.27%; p = 0.85) after pancreatic cancer resection. In sensitivity analysis, both the multivariable and stratified Cox regression analyses failed to demonstrate significant effects of EA on cancer recurrence and survival after surgery.Conclusion:There were no significant associations between EA and cancer recurrence and overall survival after curative surgery for pancreatic cancer. Prospective studies should be considered to elucidate the relationship between EA and cancer outcomes after pancreatic cancer surgery.
