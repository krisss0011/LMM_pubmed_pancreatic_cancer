Rationale:Colon cancer has a distinct migration aptitude. However, pancreatic metastasis is rare and treatment of inoperable pancreatic cancers is seldom seen.Patient concerns:A 47-year-old woman presented 2-month history of abdominal pain and abdominal distention, with anal cessation of exhaust and defecation for 4 days. A colon cancer radical resection was performed when she diagnosed with colon cancer. After 26 months, the patient complained shoulder and back pain. Multiple intraperitoneal metastases and nonisolated pancreatic metastasis of colon cancer were diagnosed.Diagnosis:Metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (MPA) with primary colon cancer.Intervention:Iodine-125 seed implantation combined chemotherapy.Outcomes:She remains free of cancer metastasis and recurrence, and has a good quality of life during the period.Lessons subsections:Iodine-125 seed implantation is an effective and safe strategy for unresectable metastatic pancreatic cancer. Iodine-125 seed implantation combined with chemotherapy improve survival for advanced pancreatic metastasis of colon cancer.
