Incidental premalignant pancreatic cystic lesions (pPCLs) are increasingly being detected in patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). The impact of chronic immunosuppression upon pPCLs may elevate risk of progression to pancreatic cancer. This systematic review assesses prevalence, outcome, and management of pPCLs in patients undergoing OLT. Systematic literature searches were performed in accordance with Cochrane review guidelines. Data on 658 patients were identified from 13 articles. Median age was 59 years with a prevalence of 6.2%. Most studies focused on branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms. Average cyst size at diagnosis was 10.3 mm. Six patients (0.9%) underwent pancreatic resection, post-OLT, for suspected "worrisome features" on imaging. One death was due to pancreatic-related cancer, post-OLT. Based on the review, the authors suggest the following: (1) patients with pPCLs undergoing OLT, without "worrisome features," should be followed conservatively; (2) presence of pPCLs alone should not preclude eligibility for OLT, nor should chronic immunosuppression be altered; (3) follow-up should parallel standard approach applied in immunocompetent patients, as development of "worrisome features" of cancer is rare and does not appear to be hastened by immunosuppression; (4) resection is recommended for surgically fit patients without portal hypertension that develop "worrisome features."
