The management of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has evolved over the last two decades. Surgical resection remain the only potential cure for this cancer. Therefore, there is an emerging emphasis on neoadjuvant therapy to maximize the probability of resection, and identify failures early. The benefit of FOLFIRINOX in various clinical stages of PDAC have been practice changing. The addition of nab-paclitaxel to the traditional gemcitabine regimen added another option for treatment. In addition, immunotherapy and targeted therapies are applicable, based on molecular features and germline alterations; albeit, these are applicable to only a small minority of patients. In this review article, we discuss the key extant literature relevant to various stages of pancreatic cancer. We also summarize ongoing clinical trials which may guide future treatments.
