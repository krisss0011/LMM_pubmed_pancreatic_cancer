Purpose:Macropinocytosis serves as a highly conserved endocytotic process that has recently been shown as a critical mechanism by which RAS-transformed cells transport extracellular protein into intracellular amino acid pathways to support their unique metabolic needs. We developed NIR fluorescently labeled molecular imaging probes to monitor macropinocytosis-mediated uptake of albumin in a K-RAS-dependent manner.Procedures:Using western blot analysis, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry, albumin retention was characterized in vitro across several RAS-activated lung and pancreatic cancer cell lines. AF790-albumin was synthesized and administered to mice bearing K-RAS mutant xenograft tumors of H460 (K-RAS p.Q61H) and H358 (K-RAS p.G12C) non-small cell lung cancers on each flank. Mice were treated daily with 2 mg/kg of ARS-1620, a targeted RAS p.G12C inhibitor, for 2 days and imaged following each treatment. Subsequently, the mice were then treated daily with 10 mg/kg of amiloride, a general inhibitor of macropinocytosis, for 2 days and imaged. Intratumoral distribution of AF790-albumin was assessed in vivo using near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging.Results:Albumin retention was observed as a function of K-RAS activity and macropinocytosis across several lung and pancreatic cancer cell lines. We documented that ARS-1620-induced inhibition of K-RAS activity or amiloride-mediated inhibition of macropinocytosis significantly reduced albumin uptake. Tumor retention in vivo of AF790-albumin was both RAS inhibition-dependent as well as abrogated by inhibition of macropinocytosis.Conclusions:These data provide a novel approach using NIR-labeled human serum albumin to identify and monitor RAS-driven tumors as well as evaluate the on-target efficacy in vivo of inhibitors, such as ARS-1620.
