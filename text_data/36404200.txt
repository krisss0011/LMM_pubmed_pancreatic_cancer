In the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer (APC), FOLFIRINOX (FX), including its dose-modified regimen (mFX), is considered an effective regimen; however, FX is also known to be associated with a high incidence of adverse events due to its multi-agent combination regimen. The efficacy and safety in elderly patients with APC have not been well studied.Aim:To compare the safety and efficacy of first-line mFX for unresectable APC in elderly and young patients.Methods:This was a multicenter retrospective cohort study included patients who received first-line mFX for unresectable APC. A total of 151 patients were included and divided into the elderly (≥65 years old; 76 patients) and young (<65 years old; 75 patients) groups. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). The secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and adverse events (AEs).Results:The median OS and PFS were similar between the two groups (OS: 14.4 months versus 13.9 months, p = 0.42; PFS: 7.4 months versus 6.6 months, p = 0.65). Although severe AEs (≥ grade 3) were observed frequently in both groups (80% versus 84.2%, p = 0.53), there was no significant difference in any of the events between the groups. In the multivariate analysis evaluating the factors affecting OS and febrile neutropenia, age was not significant factors in both analyses.Conclusion:First-line mFX for APC in elderly patients was as safe and effective as in younger patients if performance status was good. Further evaluation in a larger cohort is required to confirm our findings.
