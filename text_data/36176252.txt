The indications for resection of pulmonary metastases of pancreatic cancer are controversial even now. We report a 63-year-old woman who was found a pulmonary nodule in the apical area of the left lung by chest computed tomography (CT) seven years after pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer. Since the nodule was located adjacent to the left subclavian artery, we performed surgery for diagnosis and treatment without biopsy. The final pathological diagnosis was pulmonary metastasis of pancreatic cancer. The patient received adjuvant chemotherapy after lung resection and has remained relapse-free for 12 months.
