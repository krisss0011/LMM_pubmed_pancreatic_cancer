Background:Online adaptive stereotactic radiotherapy allows for improved target and organ at risk (OAR) delineation and inter-fraction motion management via daily adaptive planning. The use of adaptive SBRT for the treatment of pancreatic cancer (performed until now using only MRI or CT on rails-guided adaptive radiotherapy), has yielded promising outcomes. Herein we describe the first reported case of cone beam CT-guided stereotactic adaptive radiotherapy (CT-STAR) for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.Case presentation:A 61-year-old female with metastatic pancreatic cancer presented for durable palliation of a symptomatic primary pancreatic mass. She was prescribed 35 Gy/5 fractions utilizing CT-STAR. The patient was simulated utilizing an end-exhale CT with intravenous and oral bowel contrast. Both initial as well as daily adapted plans were created adhering to a strict isotoxicity approach in which coverage was sacrificed to meet critical luminal gastrointestinal OAR hard constraints. Kilovoltage cone beam CTs were acquired on each day of treatment and the radiation oncologist edited OAR contours to reflect the patient's anatomy-of-the-day. The initial and adapted plan were compared using dose volume histogram objectives, and the superior plan was delivered. Use of the initial treatment plan would have resulted in nine critical OAR hard constraint violations. The adapted plans achieved hard constraints in all five fractions for all four critical luminal gastrointestinal structures.Conclusions:We report the successful treatment of a patient with pancreatic cancer treated with CT-STAR. Prior to this treatment, the delivery of ablative adaptive radiotherapy for pancreatic cancer was limited to clinics with MR-guided and CT-on-rails adaptive SBRT technology and workflows. CT-STAR is a promising modality with which to deliver stereotactic adaptive radiotherapy for pancreatic cancer.
