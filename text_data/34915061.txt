Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the deadliest neoplastic epithelial malignancies and is projected to be the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality by 2024. Five years overall survival being ~10%, mortality and incidence rates are disturbing. Acinar to ductal cell metaplasia (ADM) encompasses cellular reprogramming and phenotypic switch-over, making it a cardinal event in tumor initiation. Differential cues and varied regulatory factors drive synchronous functions of metaplastic cell populations leading to multiple cell fates and physiological outcomes. ADM is a precursor for developing early pre-neoplastic lesions further progressing into PC due to oncogenic signaling. Hence delineating molecular events guiding tumor initiation may provide cues for regenerative medicine and precision onco-medicine. Therefore, understanding PC pathogenesis and early diagnosis are crucial. We hereby provide a timely overview of the current progress in this direction and future perspectives we foresee unfolding in the best interest of patient well-being and better clinical management of PC.
