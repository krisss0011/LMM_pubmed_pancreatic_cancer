The delayed diagnosis of pancreatic cancer has resulted in rising mortality rate and low survival rate that can be circumvented using potent theranostics biomarkers. The treatment gets complicated with delayed detection resulting in lowered 5-year relative survival rate. In our present study, we employed systems biology approach to identify central genes that play crucial roles in tumor progression. Pancreatic cancer genes collected from various databases were used to construct a statistically significant interactome with 812 genes that was further analysed thoroughly using topological parameters and functional enrichment analysis. The significant genes in the network were then identified based on the maximum degree parameter. The overall survival analysis indicated through hazard ratio [HR] and gene expression [log Fold Change] across pancreatic adenocarcinoma revealed the critical role of FN1 [HR 1.4; log2(FC) 5.748], FGA [HR 0.78; log2(FC) 1.639] FGG [HR 0.9; log2(FC) 1.597], C3 [HR 1.1; log2(FC) 2.637], and QSOX1 [HR 1.4; log2(FC) 2.371]. The functional significance of the identified hub genes signified the enrichment of integrin cell surface interactions and proteoglycan syndecan-mediated cell signaling. The differential expression, low overall survival and functional significance of FN1 gene implied its possible role in controlling metastasis in pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, alternate splice variants of FN1 gene showed 10 protein coding transcripts with conserved cell attachment site and functional domains indicating the variants' potential role in pancreatic cancer. The strong association of the identified hub-genes can be better directed to design potential theranostics biomarkers for metastasized pancreatic tumor.
