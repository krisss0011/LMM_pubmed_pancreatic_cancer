This short report describes the carcinogenesis of the pancreas leading to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) determined by molecular, cellular, and functional heterogeneity. Among the diverse types of pancreatic cancers, PDAC is the most lethal, aggressive, and one of the leading cancers associated with the highest mortality. Pancreatic cellular components like pancreatic stellate cells (PSC), mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), and pancreatic fibroblast cells (PFC) exhibit these properties in PDAC. After the appearance of point mutations in KRAS, the mutations in tumor suppressor genes appear sequentially in the order of CDKN2A, TP53, and SMAD4 that eventually resulting in PDAC development. As of today, there are no effective therapeutic options or treatments available for PDAC. The main difficulty in managing PDAC cases is its defiance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. There were several attempts to identify a suitable biomarker for the early diagnosis and prognosis of PDAC. Anyway, these recently discovered biomarkers vary in their sensitivity and specificities. Some of the other important and reliable biomarkers for PDAC are carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cell migration-inducing hyaluronan binding protein (CEMIP), serum fatty acid metabolite PC-594, and micro-RNAs (miRNAs).
