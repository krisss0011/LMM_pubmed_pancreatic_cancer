Objective:Heat shock protein A2 has been reported to be tightly associated with tumorigenesis and tumor progression. This study aimed to determine the oncogenic and immunological roles of Heat shock protein A2 in pancreatic cancer by bioinformatics.Methods:Expression of Heat shock protein A2 in tumorous and normal specimens of pancreatic cancer was analyzed using the Cancer Genome Atlas and the Cancer Genome Atlas + Genotype-Tissue Expression data sets, respectively. Relationships of Heat shock protein A2 expression with immune infiltrates in pancreatic cancer were assessed. Heat shock protein A2-associated coexpressed genes in pancreatic cancer were obtained, followed by the implementation of enrichment analysis.Results:The data demonstrated that Heat shock protein A2 was significantly overexpressed in tumorous samples compared with normal samples. Heat shock protein A2 expression was remarkably positively interrelated with CD8+ T cell, neutrophil, dendritic cell, and macrophage, but not with CD4+ T and B cells. Heat shock protein A2 expression was markedly positively relevant to both cancer-associated fibroblast and endothelial cell. Enrichment data revealed that Heat shock protein A2 was intimately involved in the tumorigenesis and progression of pancreatic cancer.Conclusion:Heat shock protein A2 is upregulated in pancreatic cancer and is closely associated with tumor immunity and aggressive progression.
