Laparoscopic radical resection of the pancreatic neck is one of the most complicated radical operations for pancreatic cancer, especially for patients who have had neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Here, we present a technique to perform laparoscopic radical antegrade modular pancreatosplenectomy (L-RAMPS) using the dorsal-caudal artery approach by making full use of the high-definition vision and operation modes of the laparoscope. The innovation and optimization of this operation are provided in the protocol. Priority should be given to the dorsal resection plane, including the dorsal side of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), the dorsal side of the pancreatic head, the root of the celiac artery (CeA), the ventral side of the left renal vessels, and the renal hilum. On the condition that the operation for pancreatic neck-body cancer is feasible and safe, the second step is to perform tumor resection en bloc surrounding the SMA and CeA from the caudal to the cephalic side to increase the rate of R0 (radical zero) resection and further prognosis.
