Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is an MRI technique for quantifying perfusion that can be used in clinical applications for classification of tumours and other types of diseases. Conventionally, the non-linear least squares (NLLS) methods is used for tracer-kinetic modelling of DCE data. However, despite promising results, NLLS suffers from long processing times (minutes-hours) and noisy parameter maps due to the non-convexity of the cost function. In this work, we investigated physics-informed deep neural networks for estimating physiological parameters from DCE-MRI signal-curves. Three voxel-wise temporal frameworks (FCN, LSTM, GRU) and two spatio-temporal frameworks (CNN, U-Net) were investigated. The accuracy and precision of parameter estimation by the temporal frameworks were evaluated in simulations. All networks showed higher precision than the NLLS. Specifically, the GRU showed to decrease the random error on veby a factor of 4.8 with respect to the NLLS for noise (SD) of 1/20. The accuracy was better for the prediction of the veparameter in all networks compared to the NLLS. The GRU and LSTM worked with arbitrary acquisition lengths. The GRU was selected for in vivo evaluation and compared to the spatio-temporal frameworks in 28 patients with pancreatic cancer. All neural network approaches showed less noisy parameter maps than the NLLS. The GRU had better test-retest repeatability than the NLLS for all three parameters and was able to detect one additional patient with significant changes in DCE parameters post chemo-radiotherapy. Although the U-Net and CNN had even better test-retest characteristics than the GRU, and were able to detect even more responders, they also showed potential systematic errors in the parameter maps. Therefore, we advise using our GRU framework for analysing DCE data.
