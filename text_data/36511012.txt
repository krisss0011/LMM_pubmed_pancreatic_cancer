A 69-year-old man with a history of pancreatic cancer was referred to our hospital for a newly developed solitary liver metastasis. Since the liver metastasis was in contact with the small intestine, it was necessary to perform radiation therapy while simultaneously monitoring the small intestine and liver metastasis, and then, MRI-guided stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR) was performed. There were no radiation-induced adverse events during the treatment and 6 months of follow-up. MRI showed complete regression of the tumor at 6 months after SABR. It seems feasible to perform SABR safely by using MRI-guided radiation therapy system even if liver metastasis developed near the intestinal tract after surgery for pancreatic cancer.
