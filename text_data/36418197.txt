Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a dismal prognosis with a 5-year overall survival of 11%. The disease is usually diagnosed at advanced stages, and systemic chemotherapy is the standard-of-care treatment for the majority of patients with PDAC. Although novel treatment options, such as targeted therapy and immunotherapy, have achieved substantial progress leading to practice-changing results, with FDA approvals for several solid tumors so far, the progress achieved for PDAC is relatively limited. Recent studies uncovered potential therapeutic targets for patients with PDAC, and potential therapeutic opportunities are currently being further examined. Herein, we review recent advances in systemic therapy regimens, including cytotoxic agents, targeted therapies, immunotherapy, and novel therapeutic options for managing patients with PDAC. We also elaborate on molecular profiling to guide treatment and existing therapeutic opportunities that may further advance the clinical care of patients with this devastating disease.
