A family of inhibitors of cell differentiation or DNA-binding proteins, known as ID proteins (ID1-4), function as mighty transcription factors in various cellular processes, such as inhibiting differentiation, promoting cell-cycle progression, senescence, angiogenesis, tumorigenesis, and metastasis in cancer. Pancreatic cancer represents the deadliest cancer with the lowest survival rate of 10% due to the diagnosis at an advanced fatal stage and therapeutic resistance. Modestly, the only curative option for this lethal cancer is surgery but is done in less than 15-20% of patients because of the locally aggressive and early metastatic nature. Finding the earliest biomarkers and targeting the various hallmarks of pancreatic cancer can improve the treatment and survival of pancreatic cancer patients. Therefore, herein in this review, we explore in depth the potential roles of ID proteins function in hallmarks of pancreatic cancer, signaling pathways, and its oncogenic and tumor-suppressive effects. Hence, understanding the roles of dysregulated ID proteins would provide new insights into its function in pancreatic cancer tumorigenesis.
