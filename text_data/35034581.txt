Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are sensitive and reliable biomarkers for tracing relapsed and metastatic cancer. Here, we explore the clinical significance of CTCs and T lymphocyte subtypes in patients with pancreatic cancer. A total of 106 patients with the pancreatic cancer were enrolled in this study. The enrichment and identification of CTCs were achieved before treatment by a PatrolCTC detection technique. Flow cytometry (FACS) was used to characterize CD4, CD8, natural killer (NK) cells, and Tregulatory (Treg) lymphocyte subtypes. Interleukin-2 (IL-2), Interleukin-4 (IL-4), Interleukin-17A (IL-17A), Interleukin-10 (IL-10), and Interferon γ (IFN-γ) were measured by meso-scale discovery (MSD) assay. Among these patients, 44 (41.5%) patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) were female and 62 (58.5%) cases were male. Case numbers with II-IV tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stages were 32 (30.2%), 50 (47.2%), and 24 (22.6%), respectively. The positive rate of CTCs before surgery was 37.5% (12/32), 88.0% (44/50) and 100% (24/24) in stage II, III, and IV patients, respectively. Total CTCs, mixed CTCs, and mesenchymal CTCs (MCTCs) were strongly relevant to shorter progression-free survival (PFS) of the patients. In addition, total CTCs (≥6) and positive MCTCs were also significantly correlated with recurrence and metastasis. The patients with high CTCs also had low levels of CD4, CD4/CD8 ratio, NK cells, IL-2, and IFNγ. In contrast, Treg cells had significant elevation in PDAC patients. These results indicated that CTCs number in PDAC patients was an independent indicator for worse PFS. High CTCs also had strong correlation with weak cellular immunity functions.
