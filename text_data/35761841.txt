Background:Over the last few years, the role of PDL1/PD-1 in pancreatic cancer development has received increasing attention, and this article is aimed at opening up new ideas for the medicine-based treatment of pancreatic cancer.Aims:To investigate the efficacy and safety of PDL1/PD-1 inhibitors versus FOLFIRINOX regimen in the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer and its impact on patient survival and to provide a reference basis for clinical treatment of pancreatic cancer.Materials and methods:The 116 pancreatic cancer patients treated in our hospital from September 2019 to September 2021 were selected and divided into 58 cases each in the (instance of watching, noticing, or making a statement) group and the comparison group according to the method based on random number table. The comparison group was treated with FOLFIRINOX, and the group was treated with PDL1/PD-1 stopper. The effectiveness, safety, and hit/effect on survival of the patients in the two groups were compared.Results:The median chemotherapy cycle for all patients was 4 (1-6), and the combined objective remission rate (0RR) was 36% and the disease control rate (DCR) was 80% after no chemotherapy in 116 patients, with 37.5% 0RR and 81.3% DCR in the observation group and 33.3% 0RR and 77.8% DCR in the comparison group. The greatest number of all patients reached SD, 44%; in the observation group, 43.8%; and in the comparison group, 44.5%. The rate of adverse reactions such as hematological toxicity, neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, nonhematological toxicity, vomiting, fatigue, infection, diarrhea, intestinal obstruction, and peripheral neuropathy was lower in 10.3% of patients in the observation group than in 25.8% of patients in the comparison group, which was significantly different byÏ‡2test (P< 0.05). The median progression-free survival curve of the two groups was 19 months in the comparison group and 22 months in the observation group. The progression-free survival in the observation group was significantly higher than that in the comparison group, and there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups (P< 0.05).Conclusion:PDL1/PD-1 inhibitors in combination with FOLFIRINOX regimens have shown longer survival than treatment with FOLFIRINOX regimens for pancreatic cancer patients, with reliable clinical efficacy, tolerable adverse effects, and a high safety profile for patients.
