Background/aim:Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide, with a poor prognosis. Owing to the difficulty of early diagnosis, the aim of this study was to isolate biomarkers from extracellular vesicles (EVs) that can lead to early diagnosis.Materials and methods:EVs in the culture supernatant were isolated from a pancreatic cancer cell line (PK-1) and expanded by using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and protein identification from each spot was performed by using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. The identified proteins were classified and compared with previously reported results for EVs from murine pancreatic cancer PAN02 cells, and their expression specificity was examined using PDAC cell lines and patient-derived PDAC tissues. In addition, the significance of selected biomarker(s) was examined based on the changes in biomarkers in the blood EVs of PDAC patients after surgery.Results:We found that the ITGA6A splice variant was predominantly expressed in several pancreatic cancer cell lines and blood EVs from patients with PDAC, whereas the ITGA6B splice variant was predominantly expressed in EVs from the blood of normal volunteers. In the expression pattern of ITGA6 in EVs from blood samples of two PDAC patients before and after resection surgery, the expression of ITGA6A in EVs significantly decreased after surgery and increased several months before clinical recurrence. Furthermore, the increased expression of ITGA6A in EVs occurred much earlier than that of CA19-9.Conclusion:Determination of ITGA6A expression in blood EVs in PDAC patients could be a useful blood marker for the early diagnosis of PDAC recurrence.
