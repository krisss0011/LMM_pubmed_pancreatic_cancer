A wide range of imaging manifestations of liver metastases can be encountered, as various primary cancers preferably metastasize to the liver (organ-specific metastases), with the imaging characteristics largely depending on various primary tumor-specific factors such as histopathologic category, degree of tumor differentiation, histologic behavior, and intratumor alterations. Characteristic imaging features potentially can help provide a more precise diagnosis in some clinical settings. These settings include those of(a)primary cancers of hollow organs such as gastrointestinal organs, the lungs, and the bladder, owing to the appearance of metastases that cannot be applied to the liver, which is a parenchymal organ;(b)unknown primary tumors;(c)more than one primary tumor;(d)another emergent malignancy; and(e)transformation to a different histopathologic tumor subtype. The characteristic features include the target sign on T2-weighted MR images or during the hepatobiliary phase of hypovascular metastasis, the peripheral rim washout sign on delayed phase images, peritumor hyperintensity during the hepatobiliary phase, hypervascular metastasis, a cystic appearance with marked hyperintensity on T2-weighted images, marked hyperintensity on T1-weighted images, calcification, capsular retraction, absence of the vessel-penetrating sign, distribution of liver metastases, and rare intraductal forms of metastases. In addition to various factors associated with the primary cancer, desmoplastic reactions around the tumor-which can be observed in adenocarcinomas with peripheral and peritumor enhancement, distinct arterioportal shunts with metastases from pancreatic ductal carcinoma, and pseudocirrhosis-also can affect these findings. The authors review the characteristic imaging findings of liver metastases from various primary cancers, with a focus on the mechanisms that underlie organ-specific liver metastases.Online supplemental material is available for this article.Â©RSNA, 2022.
