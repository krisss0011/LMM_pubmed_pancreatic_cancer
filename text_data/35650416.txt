Background:Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the most lethal malignant tumor, with average survival period of about 10 months. C-X-C ligand 5 (CXCL5), an important chemokine for immune cell accumulation in tumor tissues, has been reported to be involved in a variety of human cancers. However, the exact role of CXCL5 in PC progression has not been well defined.Methods:The expression of CXCL5 in PC was analyzed based on online databases and clinical specimens immunohistochemical staining, and Western blotting of CXCL5 in PC cell lines and patient samples. The correlation between CXCL5 expression and prognosis in PC was explored. The role of CXCL5 in PC was investigated through in vitro and in vivo experiments.Results:The expression of CXCL5 was significantly increased in PC tissues compared with that in pancreas tissues, and CXCL5 high expression predicts poor prognosis in PC patients. Further analyses demonstrated that overexpression of CXCL5 in PC cells was positively related to higher proliferation rate, higher migration ability, and higher EMT markers including SNAI2 and TWIST1 of tumor cells in vitro. Consistently, the knockdown of CXCL5 in PC cells harmed the proliferation rate, migration ability, and expression of EMT indexes of tumor cells in vitro. Importantly, knockdown of CXCL5 inhibited the growth of xenograft tumors in vivo.Conclusion:CXCL5 high expression predicts poor prognosis in PC patients. CXCL5 promotes PC cell growth and EMT process. Inhibition of CXCL5 may be a potential therapeutic approach for PC.
