Background:Pancreatic cancer is expected to replace lung cancer as the second greatest cause of cancer mortality by 2025. It has been a particularly the most lethal kind of cancer.Objective:Despite the new innovations, research, and improvements in drug design; there are many hurdles limiting their therapeutic applications such as intrinsic resistance to chemotherapeutics, inability to deliver a sufficient concentration of drug to the target site, lack of effectiveness of drug delivery systems. These are the major contributing factors to limit the treatment. So, the main objective is to overcome these types of problems by nanotechnology and ligand conjugation approach to achieve targeted drug delivery.Method:Nanotechnology has emerged as a major approach to develop cancer treatment. Regardless of the severity, there are several issues that restrict the therapeutic impact, including inadequate transport across biological barriers, limited cellular absorption, degradation, and faster clearance.Result:Targeted drug delivery may overcome these obstacles by binding a natural ligand to the surface of nanocarriers, which enhances the drug's capacity to release at the desired site and minimizes adverse effects.Conclusion:This study will investigate the possible outcomes of targeted therapeutic agent delivery in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, as well as the limitations and future prospects.
