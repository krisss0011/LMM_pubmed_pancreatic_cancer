Introduction:Resection of oligometastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has historically been ineffective, however modern systemic chemotherapy has improved survival. Thus, re-evaluating safety and outcomes of surgical resection in selected patients with limited peritoneal metastasis (PM) warrants consideration.Methods:From 2018 to 2021, patients with PDAC and positive cytology or limited PM without extraperitoneal metastasis and who had an objective response to â‰¥ 6 months of systemic chemotherapy were enrolled. Patients underwent laparoscopic hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) with cisplatin/mitomycin C. If amenable to a complete cytoreduction, patients went on to cytoreduction and HIPEC.Results:Overall, 18 patients were enrolled and received a median of 14 (interquartile range [IQR] 12-17) cycles of chemotherapy; 16 (89%) patients received chemoradiation. Laparoscopic HIPEC was completed in 17 patients, with a median length of stay of 1 day, and no grade III complications or hematological toxicities were observed. All 18 patients subsequently underwent a complete cytoreduction (CC-0) along with definitive treatment of the primary tumor, with formal resection (7/18), irreversible electroporation (IRE; 10/18), or intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT; 1/18). Median PCI was 2 (IQR 0-4), median LOS was 7 days (IQR 6-8), and 7 (39%) patients were readmitted. Eight (44%) patients experienced grade 3 or higher complications, including one 30-day mortality. At a median follow-up of 16 months, the median progression-free survival was 20 months and the median overall survival was 26 months.Conclusion:Cytoreduction and HIPEC for selected patients with low-volume PM from PDAC is safe and feasible with favorable short-term outcomes. A phase II trial (NCT04858009) is now enrolling to further assess this multimodality approach in select patients.
