Pancreatic cancer has poor prognosis despite the various developed multimodal treatment strategies. Currently, neoadjuvant chemotherapy and immunotherapy have attracted substantial attention as effective treatment strategies. However, amplifying immune response with existing treatments is difficult. We developed telomerase-specific oncolytic adenoviruses (OAs), including OBP-301 that is currently tested in a clinical trial of combined anti-PD-1 antibody and p53-armed OBP- 301 variant(OBP-702). OAs have immune-modulation functions and induce CD8+ T cells into tumors by releasing immunogenic cell death markers, such as extracellular adenosine triphosphate. Here, we investigated the effectiveness of OBP- 702 in pancreatic cancer treatments, focusing on the influence on CD8+ memory T cells.
