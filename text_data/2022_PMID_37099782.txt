OBJECTIVES: Comorbid psychiatric illness has been associated with worse outcomes 
after some major surgical procedures. We hypothesized that patients with 
preexisting mood disorders would have worse postoperative and oncologic outcomes 
after pancreatic cancer resection.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed Surveillance, Epidemiology, 
and End Results patients with resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma. A 
preexisting mood disorder was classified if a patient was diagnosed and/or 
treated with medication approved for depression/anxiety within 6 months before 
surgery.
RESULTS: Of 1305 patients, 16% had a preexisting mood disorder. Mood disorders 
had no impact on hospital length of stay (12.9 vs 13.2 days, P = 0.75), 30-day 
complications (26% vs 22%, P = 0.31), 30-day readmissions (26% vs 21%, P = 0.1), 
or mortality (30 days: 3% vs 4%, P = 0.35); only an increased 90-day 
readmissions rate (42% vs 31%, P = 0.001) was observed. No effect on adjuvant 
chemotherapy receipt (62.5% vs 69.2%, P = 0.06) or survival (24 months, 43% vs 
39%, P = 0.44) was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Preexisting mood disorders influenced 90-day readmissions after 
pancreatic resection, but not other postoperative or oncologic outcomes. These 
findings suggest that affected patients should be expected to have outcomes 
similar to patients without mood disorders.
