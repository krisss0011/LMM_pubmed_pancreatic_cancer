The long-term survival of patients with locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer is extremely poor. We present our experience with a 67-year-old woman who had a 40-mm mass in the body of the pancreas. Tumor infiltration reached the gastroduodenal artery, celiac artery, common hepatic artery, and splenic artery. After 10 courses of FOLFIRINOX, 2 courses of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel, and 6 courses of gemcitabine alone, we performed distal pancreatectomy with celiac axis resection and hepatic artery reconstruction. The bifurcation of the gastroduodenal artery and the proper hepatic artery had to be resected, after which we created 2 anastomoses: proper hepatic-to-middle colic artery, and second jejunal-to-right gastroepiploic artery. Histopathologic examination revealed an Evans grade IIb histologic response to prior treatment and verified the R0 resection status. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 30 after treatment of a grade B pancreatic fistula and is still alive, without recurrence, more than 5 years after initiation of treatment. This patient with locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer achieved long-term survival through perioperative multidisciplinary treatment, including distal pancreatectomy with celiac axis resection and hepatic artery reconstruction. This aggressive procedure could be a treatment option for patients with locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer.
