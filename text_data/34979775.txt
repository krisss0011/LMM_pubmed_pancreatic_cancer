Objective:To explore the risk factors and preventive strategies of pancreatitis after percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) in patients with pancreatic cancer and obstructive jaundice.Methods:A total of 241 patients were retrospectively analyzed from May 2001 to October 2014 in Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital. The possibly correlated 9 factors were analyzed, including gender, age, hemoglobin level, total bilirubin level, degree of pancreatic duct dilatation, degree of pancreatic atrophy, degree of biliary stenosis, the pancreatic duct visualization, and drainage mode.Results:Univariate analysis suggested that pancreatic duct dilatation, pancreatic atrophy, visualized pancreatic duct and drainage mode were associated with the incidence of pancreatitis after PTBD (P<0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that visualization of pancreatic duct (OR=6.33) was a risk factor for pancreatitis, while pancreatic duct dilatation (OR=0.14), pancreatic atrophy (OR=0.12) and external drainage (OR=0.11) were protective factors for pancreatitis.Conclusion:In pateints with pancreatic cancer and obstructive jaundice, pancreatic duct dilatation and pancreatic atrophy predict low risk of pancreatitis after PTBD,while intraoperative pancreatic duct visualization and internal or external drainage may increase the incidence of postoperative pancreatitis.
