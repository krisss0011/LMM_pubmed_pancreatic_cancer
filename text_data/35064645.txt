Background:A history of familial pancreatic cancer (FPC) increases the incidence of pancreatic cancer (PC) among first-degree relatives. We aimed to determine the incidence of FPC and analyze its clinical characteristics.Methods:Between 2010 and 2014, 1159 patients with PC were included in the study. We evaluated the incidence of FPC, clinicopathological features, and survival prognosis between FPC and non-FPC patients. We further analyzed the clinical outcomes of 389 patients with PC who underwent curative-intent surgery.Results:Familial pancreatic cancer incidence was 3.1% (n = 36) among all patients with PC (n = 1159). FPC was diagnosed at an advanced clinical stage compared to non-FPC (P = .041). The tested variables and 5-year survival rate (5YSR) between FPC and non-FPC after propensity score matching had no differences (5YSR: 4.6% vs 2.6%, P = .834). Among PC patients who underwent curative-intent surgery (n = 389), FPC incidence was 1.8% (n = 7). FPC patients were older than non-FPC patients (75.3 ± 4.7 years vs 64.0 ± 9.9 years, P < .001). 5YSR tended to differ between FPC and non-FPC (14.3% vs 22.5%, P = .07) groups.Conclusion:Familial pancreatic cancer is diagnosed at an advanced stage, and FPC that has undergone resection is associated with older age or worse prognosis. A prospective nationwide pedigree registration system was required.
