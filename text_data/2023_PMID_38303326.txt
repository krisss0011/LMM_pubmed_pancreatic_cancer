Pseudomyxoma peritonei(PMP)is a rare condition caused by intraductal papillary 
mucinous neoplasm(IPMN). At our institution, 3 cases, along with literature 
review, of PMP caused by IPMN were treated with cytoreductive surgery. In case 
1, a 70-year-old man was pathologically diagnosed with low-grade PMP with 
intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma. Recurrence was discovered 68 months 
after surgery, and the patient died after 78 months. In case 2, a 69-year-old 
man was pathologically diagnosed with high-grade PMP with signet-ring cell 
carcinoma caused by intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma. The patient died 8 
months post-surgery. In case 3, a 77-year-old woman was pathologically diagnosed 
with low- grade(partially high-grade)PMP with intraductal papillary mucinous 
adenoma. There was a recurrence 14 months post- surgery. The patient is still 
alive because of systemic chemotherapy 32 months after surgery.
