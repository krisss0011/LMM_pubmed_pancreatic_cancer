Background:Pancreatic cysts are common. However, most studies are based on data collected from individual centers. The present study aimed to evaluate the changes of management patterns for pancreatic cystic lesions (PCLs) by analyzing large epidemiologic data.Methods:Between January 2007 and December 2018, information regarding pancreatic cystic lesions was acquired from the nationwide Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service database in Korea.Results:The final number of patients with pancreatic cysts was 165 277 among the total claims for reimbursement of 855 983 associated with PCLs over 12 years. The total number of claims were increased from 19 453 in 2007 to 155 842 in 2018 and the prevalence increased from 0.04% to 0.23%. For 12 years, 2874 (1.7%) had pancreatic cancer and 8212 (5.0%) underwent surgery, and 36 had surgery for twice (total 8248 pancreatectomy). After ruling out claims from the first 3 years of washout period, the incidence increased from 9891 to 24 651 and the crude incidence rate of PCLs expanded from 19.96 per 100 000 to 47.77 per 100 000. Compared to specific neoplasm codes (D136 or D377), the use of pancreatic cyst code (K862) has been remarkably increased and the most common since 2010. The annual number of pancreatectomies increased from 518 to 861 between 2007 and 2012, and decreased to 596 until 2018. The percentage of pancreatic cancer in patients who received pancreatectomy increased from 5.6% in 2007 to 11.7% in 2018.Conclusions:The incidence of PCLs is rapidly increasing. Among PCLs, indeterminate cyst is increasing outstandingly. A trend of decreasing in the number of resections and increasing cancer rates among resected cysts may be attributed to the updated international guidelines.
