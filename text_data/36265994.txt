The management of localized pancreatic cancer (PC) has evolved significantly in the last decade, moving away from prioritizing surgery as the primary treatment modality to embracing the need for preoperative (neoadjuvant) multimodality therapy to achieve durable disease-free control. Neoadjuvant therapy is currently recommended for all patients with borderline and locally advanced PC, and is being increasingly utilized in patients with resectable disease as well. When assessing operability the following 3 factors should be considered: clinical stage of disease, response to neoadjuvant therapy, and patient performance status. Patients who demonstrate a response to neoadjuvant therapy may benefit significant from surgical resection.
