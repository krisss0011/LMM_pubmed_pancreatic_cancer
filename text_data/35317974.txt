Background:Pancreatic cancer is a disease of the elderly; patients >65 years are 60% of the cases. Due to multiple comorbidities, treating these patients is challenging. We report the efficacy and safety of carbon ion radiotherapy (C-ion RT) in octogenarians.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed the cases of 46 pancreatic cancer patients aged ≥80 years (median 83, range 80-97) treated with definitive C-ion RT in 2007-2018 at our institute.Results:Twenty-five patients (54%) had resectable or borderline-resectable disease; none underwent surgery (because of medical reasons, e.g., age, multiple comorbidities). C-ion RT was delivered with a median dose of 55.2 Gy (RBE) in 12 fractions. The survivors' median follow-up period was 43 (range 19-76) months. The entire cohort's median overall survival (OS) was 15 (95%CI: 14-22) months with a 3-year OS of 20% (95%CI: 11%-35%). On both univariate and multivariate analyses, baseline CA19-9 remained the significant independent OS prognostic factor (p = 0.032). The 3-year local control rate for all patients was 34% (95%CI: 19%-53%). Local failure (n = 25, 54%) was as common as distant relapse (n = 26, 57%); 33% of the patients experienced both local and systemic failure. About 15% underwent re-C-ion RT for infield recurrence; they achieved a median 22-month OS. No patients exhibited grade ≥3 severe acute or late toxicities (including those who received re-C-ion RT).Conclusions:C-ion RT in octogenarians with pancreatic cancer showed promising outcomes with acceptable acute and late toxicities and can be considered a reasonable alternative to radical surgery.
