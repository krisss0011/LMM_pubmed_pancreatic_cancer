Background and aims:Sarcopenia is an important prognostic factor for cancer patients. Here, we assessed the effects of sarcopenia on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) who underwent treatment with first-line gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (GEM and nab-PTX).Methods:The study enrolled patients with unresectable PDAC who underwent chemotherapy between April 2016 and May 2020. The skeletal muscle index (SMI) at the third lumbar spine level (L3) was calculated from computed tomography (CT) images. Propensity score analysis was used to compare PFS and OS in the sarcopenia and non-sarcopenia groups. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine variables significantly associated with prognosis.Results:Of the 176 patients who received first-line GEM and nab-PTX, 84 were selected and divided into two groups of 42 (the sarcopenia and the non-sarcopenia groups) by propensity score matching. The median PFS of the sarcopenia and the non-sarcopenia groups was 5.0 and 8.0 months, respectively (p = 0.004). The median OS was 10.3 and 18.1 months, respectively (p = 0.001). Multivariate analyses revealed that sarcopenia was an independent prognostic factor for PFS and OS (p = 0.004, p = 0.001, respectively). The rates of major grade 3 or 4 AEs were significantly higher in the sarcopenia group (p = 0.008).Conclusions:Sarcopenia is an independent indicator of a poor prognosis in patients with PDAC treated with first-line GEM and nab-PTX.
