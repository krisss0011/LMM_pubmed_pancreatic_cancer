Very few surveys have been carried out of oncosurgical decisions made in patients with pancreatic cancer (PC), or of the possible differences in therapeutic approaches between low/medium and high-volume centers. A survey was sent out to centers affiliated to the Spanish Group of Pancreatic Surgery (GECP) asking about their usual pre-, intra- and post-operative management of PC patients and describing five imaginary cases of PC corresponding to common scenarios that surgeons regularly assess in oncosurgical meetings. A consensus was considered to have been reached when 80% of the answers coincided. We received 69 responses from the 72 GECP centers (response rate 96%). Pre-operative management: consensus was obtained on 7/16 questions (43.75%) with no significant differences between low- vs high-volume centers. Intra-operative: consensus was obtained on 11/28 questions (39.3%). D2 lymphadenectomy, biliary culture, intra-operative biliary margin study, pancreatojejunostomy, and two loops were significantly more frequent in high-volume hospitals (p < 0.05). Post-operative: consensus was obtained on 2/8 questions (25%). No significant differences were found between low-/medium- vs high-volume hospitals. Of the 41 questions asked regarding the cases, consensus was reached on 22 (53.7%). No differences in the responses were found according to the type of hospital. Management and cases: consensus was reached in 42/93 questions (45.2%). At GECP centers, consensus was obtained on 45% of the questions. Only 5% of the answers differed between low/medium and high-volume centers (all intra-operative). A more specific assessment of why high-volume centers obtain the best results would require the design of complex prospective studies able to measure the therapeutic decisions made and the effectiveness of their execution.
