Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a prominent population of stromal cells, play a crucial role in tumor progression, prognosis, and treatment response. However, the relationship among CAF-based molecular signatures, clinical outcomes, and tumor microenvironment infiltration remains largely elusive in pancreatic cancer (PC). Here, we collected multicenter PC data and performed integrated analysis to investigate the role of CAF-related genes (CRGs) in PC. Firstly, we demonstrated that Î±-SMA+CAFs were the most prominent stromal components and correlated with the poor survival rates of PC patients in our tissue microarrays. Then, we discriminated two diverse molecular subtypes (CAF clusters A and B) and revealed the significant differences in the tumor immune microenvironment (TME), four reported CAF subpopulations, clinical characteristics, and prognosis in PC samples. Furthermore, we analyzed their association with the immunotherapy response of PC patients. Lastly, a CRG score was constructed to predict prognosis, immunotherapy responses, and chemosensitivity in pancreatic cancer patients. In summary, these findings provide insights into further research targeting CAFs and their TME, and they pave a new road for the prognosis evaluation and individualized treatment of PC patients.
