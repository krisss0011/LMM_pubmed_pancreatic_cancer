Metastatic pancreatic cancer remains a major clinical challenge, emphasizing the urgent need for the exploitation of novel therapeutic approaches with superior response. In this study, we demonstrate that the aberrant activation of prostaglandin E2(PGE2) receptor 4 (EP4) is a pro-metastatic signal in pancreatic cancer. To explore the therapeutic role of EP4 signaling, we developed a potent and selective EP4 antagonist L001 with single-nanomolar activity using a panel of cell functional assays. EP4 antagonism by L001 effectively repressed PGE2-elicited cell migration and the invasion of pancreatic cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, L001 alone or combined with the chemotherapy drug gemcitabine exhibited remarkably anti-metastasis activity in a pancreatic cancer hepatic metastasis model with excellent tolerability and safety. Mechanistically, EP4 blockade by L001 abrogated Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP)-driven pro-metastatic factor expression in pancreatic cancer cells. The suppression of YAP's activity was also observed upon L001 treatment in vivo. Together, these findings support the notions that EP4-YAP signaling axis is a vital pro-metastatic pathway in pancreatic cancer and that EP4 inhibition with L001 may deliver a therapeutic benefit for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.
