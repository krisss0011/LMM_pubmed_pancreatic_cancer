Background and objectives: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma represents one of the common malignancies with a relatively poor prognosis. However, early detection of this type of cancer may prove to be curable. Recent advancements in the radiological techniques might represent a hope for the early diagnosis and prediction of prognosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This study aimed to assess the prognostic value of the primary tumor volumetric parameters obtained from FDG PET/CT first stage for the overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and to explore the possible correlation between serum matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and the patients’ characteristics. Methods: Fifty patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma were subjected to FDG PET/CT scan. The SUVpeak, SUVmax, and the metabolic tumor volume (MTV) were determined, as well as the SUVmean of the liver. Moreover, serum levels of MMP-2 were assessed. Follow-up of the patients was carried out for sixty months with determination of PFS and OS. Results: Peak SUV ≥ 3.9 was significantly correlated with the primary pancreatic lesions’ mean total glycolytic activity of >92 g, and MTV and was directly correlated with mortality. There was a positive correlation between peak SUV ≥ 3.9 and 50% SUVmax threshold > 82. Moreover, there was significant correlation between the total glycolytic activity and the studied clinicopathologic factors, except the age and sex of the patients and ECOG performance status. In addition, FDG uptake and the tumor glycolytic activity were substantially linked with a shorter PFS. Similarly, a strong correlation was found between MTV and PFS. Serum MMP-2 levels showed a significant relationship with the performance status, tumor stage, SUVmax threshold, and the glycolytic activity. Conclusions: Peak SUV, main lesion SUVmax, serum MMP-2, and the tumor glycolytic activity are good predictors of PFS of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
