The use of humanized mouse models for oncology is rapidly expanding. Autologous patient-derived systems are particularly attractive as they can model the human cancer's heterogeneity and immune microenvironment. In this study, we developed an autologous humanized mouse cancer model by engrafting NSG mice with patient-derived xenografts and infused matched peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We first defined the time course of xenogeneic graft-versus-host-disease (xGVHD) and determined that only minimal xGVHD was observed for up to 8 weeks. Next, colorectal and pancreatic cancer patient-derived xenograft bearing NSG mice were infused with 5x106 human PBMCS for development of the humanized cancer models (iPDX). Early after infusion of human PBMCs, iPDX mice demonstrated engraftment of human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the blood of both colorectal and pancreatic cancer patient-derived models that persisted for up to 8 weeks. At the end of the experiment, iPDX xenografts maintained the features of the primary human tumor including tumor grade and cell type. The iPDX tumors demonstrated infiltration of human CD3+ cells with high PD-1 expression although we observed significant intra and inter- model variability. In summary, the iPDX models reproduced key features of the corresponding human tumor. The observed variability and high PD-1 expression are important considerations that need to be addressed in order to develop a reproducible model system.
