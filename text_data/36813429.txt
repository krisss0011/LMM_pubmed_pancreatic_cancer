An association between acute pancreatitis (AP) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been proposed but the mechanisms of pancreatic injury of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the implicative role on the development of AP are not yet fully understood. COVID-19 also imposed major challenges on pancreatic cancer management. We conducted an analysis on the mechanisms of pancreatic injury by SARS-CoV-2 and reviewed published case reports of AP attributed to COVID-19. We also examined the pandemic effect on pancreatic cancer diagnosis and management, including pancreatic surgery.
