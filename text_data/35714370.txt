Recently imaging with new PET radiotracers that act as fibroblast activation protein inhibitors (FAPIs) showed promising results in oncology and even nononcology imaging. Here we report a case of advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma, imaged with both 18 F-FDG and 68 Ga-FAPI-46 PET/CT scans. The result indicated that imaging with 68 Ga-FAPI-46 showed significant improvement in detection of metastases as well as local malignancy recurrence. Moreover, the intensity and SUVs of the lesions were higher in 68 Ga-FAPI-46 scan compared with 18 F-FDG.
