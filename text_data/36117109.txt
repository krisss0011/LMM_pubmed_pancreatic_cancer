Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is clinically challenging due to late diagnosis and resistance to therapy. Two major PDAC subtypes have been defined based on malignant epithelial cell gene expression profiles; the basal-like/squamous subtype is associated with a worse prognosis and therapeutic resistance as opposed to the classical subtype. Subtype specification is not binary, consistent with plasticity of malignant cell phenotype. PDAC heterogeneity and plasticity reflect partly malignant cell-intrinsic transcriptional and epigenetic regulation. However, the stromal and immune compartments of the tumor microenvironment (TME) also determine disease progression and therapy response. It is evident that integration of intrinsic and extrinsic factors can dictate subtype heterogeneity, and thus, delineating the pathways involved can help to reprogram PDAC towards a classical/druggable subtype.
