Pancreatic cancer (PaCa), a common and highly lethal malignant cancer, is often insensitive to radio- and/or chemotherapy. Therefore, effective treatment regiments are still lacking. Herein, we found that an extract of Ficus carica fruit (EFCF) exerted anti-tumor effects on PaCa cells. EFCF induced cell viability inhibition and apoptotic cell death in two PaCa cell lines in a dose- and time dependent manner. EFCF effectively suppressed the migration, metastasis, invasion, and colony formation of PaCa cells. Mechanistically, EFCF stimulated an increase in intracellular ROS to promote cell death and senescence. EFCF treatment also triggered autophagy, and autophagy inhibition enhanced EFCF-induced cell death. We found that EFCF decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and promoted lipid peroxidation. Moreover, intragastric administration of EFCF effectively suppressed xenograft PaCa growth inhibition by activating cell death. EFCF had no apparent toxicity to normal pancreatic epithelial cells. Together, these findings suggest that EFCF may be a potential treatment for PaCa.
