Purpose:Grade 3 neuroendocrine tumor (NET G3) is a novel pathologic category within gastro-entero-pancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) but its clinical behavior and therapeutic management still remain challenging. Prognostic and predictive factors aiding NET G3 management are needed.Patients and methods:We performed a retrospective analysis from 2015 to 2020 of all patients with > 20% Ki-67, well-differentiated NETs evaluated within our NEN-dedicated multidisciplinary team. We divided the sample according the timing of NET G3 diagnosis, the radiotracers distribution and Ki-67. We analyzed the correlation between these NET G3 features and clinical outcomes.Results:Among 3238 multidisciplinary discussion reports, we selected 55 patients, 48 from GEP and 7 from an occult GEP origin. In 45 patients, NET G3 diagnosis occurred at the beginning of clinical history (upfront-NET G3), whereas in 10, during the NET G1-G2 clinical history (late-NET G3). Patients with â‰¤ 30% (34/55) vs. > 30% Ki-67 (21/55) had a better overall survival (OS) (p = 0.042); patients with a homogeneous vs. inhomogeneous/negative68Gallium(68Ga)-DOTA-Peptide Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) showed a trend to a better OS, and a significant better progression-free survival (PFS) (p = 0.033). A better OS was observed for negative/inhomogeneous vs. homogeneous 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG)-PET/CT (p = 0.027). A trend to a better OS was reported in late- vs. upfront-NET G3, while the latter showed a significantly better response rate (RR) (p = 0.048).Conclusion:Our findings suggested that Ki-67 cutoff, functional imaging and the timing to NET G3 diagnosis may help clinicians in more accurate selection of NET G3 management. Prospective studies are needed.
