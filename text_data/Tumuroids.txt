Abstract 
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has an extremely poor response to chemo- and (modest-dose convention-
ally fractionated) radio-therapy. Emerging evidence suggests that pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) secrete deoxycyti-dine, which confers resistance to gemcitabine. In particular, deoxycytidine was detected by analysis of metabolites in fractionated media from different mouse PSCs, showing that it caused PDAC cells chemoresistance by reducing the capacity of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) for gemcitabine phosphorylation. However, data on human models are miss-ing and dCK expression was not associated with clinical efficacy of gemcitabine. We recently established co-culture models of hetero-spheroids including primary human PSCs and PDAC cells showing their importance as a platform to test the effects of cancer- and stroma-targeted drugs. Here, we discuss the limitations of previous studies and the potential use of above-mentioned models to study molecular mechanisms underlying chemo- and radio-resistance.

We read with great interest the recent article by Dalin 
and collaborators [1] on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis and cell viability assays in differ
-
ent models of PDAC cells and PSCs, showing that secre -
tion of deoxycytidine by PSCs conferred resistance to gemcitabine.
PDAC is typically characterized by features associated 
with poor prognosis: therapy resistance, early metasta
-
sis and recurrence [2]. Approximately 80% of PDAC vol -
ume is stroma comprising a liquid milieu of cytokines/growth factors and extracellular vesicles, a cellular com
-
ponent (PSCs, fibroblasts, endothelial and immune cells), and an extracellular matrix. These components are interconnected and their communication with can
-
cer cells might affect aggressive behavior and therapy response (Fig. 1a).
Despite inherent and acquired resistance against 
most chemotherapeutic drugs, cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the mainstay of the treatment for PDAC patients, the majority of whom present with advanced-stage dis
-
ease. Gemcitabine resistance is multifactorial and PSCs have been implicated in several of the underlying pro
-
cesses [3]. Dalin and collaborators [1] performed an ele -
gant analysis of metabolites in fractionated media from different mouse PSCs, showing that deoxycytidine is present and protects PDAC cells from gemcitabine cyto

toxicity, raising the question of whether deoxycytidine affects key oncogenic pathways as well. Notably, mouse macrophages are also able to secrete deoxycytidine [4], but hepatic stellate cells do not. No data are available from primary human PSCs from cancer patients. Pri

PDAC cells [5], emphasizing the importance of appropri -
ate PSC-PDAC co-culture models, with paired primary 
cancer cells and PSCs. Moreover, when a PDAC organoid was assessed for the influence of PSC conditioned media, no significant protection against gemcitabine cytotoxicity was observed [1]. This interesting observation suggests that under particular physiological conditions and in 3D models, the microenvironment could behave differ
-
ently. This motivates efforts to investigate these findings in even more appropriate tumor-TME preclinical models.
We recently established PSC/PDAC spheroids to 
be used as an important tool for screening of cancer- and stroma-targeted drugs (Fig.  1b). These co-culture 
spheroids exhibited higher resistance to gemcitabine compared to PDAC-only spheroids, whereas c-MET inhibitors tivantinib, PHA-665752 and crizotinib were equally effective in both spheroid models [6]. The poten
-
tial of targeting c-MET receptor as a valuable therapeu -
tic strategy in selected cases of PDAC was also shown in a recent in  vivo study which demonstrated that a triple combination of gemcitabine with HGF and c-MET inhib
-
itors was the most effective strategy to both reduce the size of primary tumours as well as to completely elimi
-
nate metastases [7].
In order to combat the drug- and radioresistance medi -
ated by PSCs in PDAC [8], these novel 3D preclinical model studies are highly preferred to investigate the interaction between pharmacological and radiothera
-
peutic strategies, for example through testing of com -
binations of radiosensitizing and cytotoxic agents with radiation. Similar studies have been performed using 3D preclinical models in glioblastoma [9].
Another important question arises concerning the 
hypothetical role of dCK in gemcitabine resistance. Treatment with PSC media did not reduce intracellular levels of gemcitabine, suggesting no uptake competition, but rescued dCK-catalyzed formation of intracellular deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) levels [1]. It would be of interest to determine the formation of gemcitabine-diphosphate, which inhibits ribonucleotide-reductase, responsible for synthesizing deoxynucleotides required for DNA synthesis/repair. A decreased dCTP would indeed result in reduced feedback inhibition of dCK, and potentiate gemcitabine activation, favoring gem
-
citabine-triphosphate in its competition with dCTP for incorporation into DNA [10]. Data on the synthesis of gemcitabine-triphosphate and its incorporation into DNA are therefore warranted to further elucidate the mechanism of resistance.
Finally, dCK expression is not clearly associated with 
clinical efficacy of gemcitabine in PDAC [5]. Further studies on the complex TME comprising distinct cell
