Context.—:The detection of pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCNs) has increased owing to the advancement and widespread use of imaging modalities, resulting in differences between past and current management methods for PCNs, including intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs). Therefore, clinicians should accurately diagnose and determine appropriate treatment strategies. However, previously published treatment guidelines for IPMNs present different indications for treatment.Objective.—:To review the current status of PCNs, including epidemiologic change, malignancy risk, and factors for treatment, and to provide the optimal management algorithms for PCNs, including IPMNs, from the clinician's point of view.Data sources.—:Literature review of published studies and the authors' own work.Conclusions.—:The treatment of PCNs relies on the type of cyst that is present or suspected. Serous cystic neoplasms are usually benign, and observation is sufficient. However, surgical treatment is required for mucinous cystic neoplasms, and malignancy risk differs according to lesion size. Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms also require surgery. The detection of small IPMNs has been increasing, and most branch duct-type IPMNs are dormant. However, cysts 3 cm or larger or growing branch duct-type IPMNs must be carefully monitored because of the increasing risk of malignancy. Therefore, surveillance strategies should be different according to the size of the lesions. A tailored approach is needed for selecting surgery or surveillance, considering the malignancy potential of the lesion and patient-associated factors such as operative risks and life expectancy. Nomograms are valuable tools for selecting treatment methods as a customized approach for IPMNs.
