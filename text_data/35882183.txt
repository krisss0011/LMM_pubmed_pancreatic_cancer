Introduction:Pancreatic cancer (PC) represents an unfavorable prognosis condition, even in patients with resectable disease. The aim of this series was to investigate the role of treatment intensification with adjuvant chemoradiation (CRT) in radically resected PC patients.Methods:Data from PC patients who underwent radical surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy (CT), and CRT throughout a 20-year period were retrospectively collected. Actuarial local control (LC) and the overall survival (OS) were the primary endpoints, with disease-free survival and metastasis-free survival (MFS) representing secondary endpoints.Results:The analysis included 108 PC patients treated with adjuvant CRT and CT from January 2000 to August 2019. Median age was 66 years (range: 40-83), and all patients underwent radical surgical resection with adjuvant CT (88, 81.5%) plus concomitant CRT (101, 93.5%) or radiotherapy alone (7, 6.5%). The median dose delivered to the tumor bed was 50.4 Gy (range: 45-50.6 Gy), while median dose to regional lymphatic drainage stations was 39.6 Gy (range 39.6-45 Gy). Concomitant CT was a gemcitabine-based regimen in the vast majority of patients (87, 80.6%). Median follow-up time was 21 months; the 2- and 5-year LC rates were 75.8% and 59.1%, respectively. Perineural invasion at pathological assessment was found significantly associated with LC (p = 0.028). Median OS was 40 months with 2- and 5-year OS rates of 73.9% and 41.6%, respectively.Conclusions:The outcomes of this series suggest to investigate the possible impact of adding adjuvant CRT to CT in PC patients. Timing and combination of modern CRT with new systemic therapies need to be further investigated to personalize therapy and optimize clinical advantages.
