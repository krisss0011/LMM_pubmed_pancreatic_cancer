Background & aims:Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) arises from several types of premalignant lesions, including intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm (ITPN); however, the molecular pathogenesis of ITPN remains unknown.Methods:We performed studies with Hnf1b-CreERT2; Ptenf/f; Arid1af/fmice to investigate the consequence of genetic deletion of Arid1a in adult pancreatic ductal cells in the context of oncogenic PI3K/Akt pathway activation.Results:Simultaneous deletion of Arid1a and Pten in pancreatic ductal cells resulted in the development of ITPN, which progressed to PDAC, in mice. Simultaneous loss of Arid1a and Pten induced dedifferentiation of pancreatic ductal cells and Yes-associated protein 1/Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (YAP/TAZ) pathway activation. Consistent with the mouse data, TAZ expression was found elevated in human ITPNs and ITPN-derived PDACs but not in human intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, indicating that activation of the TAZ pathway is a distinctive feature of ITPN. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of the YAP/TAZ pathway suppressed the dedifferentiation of pancreatic ductal cells and development of ITPN in Arid1a and Pten double-knockout mice.Conclusion:Concurrent loss of Arid1a and Pten in adult pancreatic ductal cells induced ITPN and ITPN-derived PDAC in mice through aberrant activation of the YAP/TAZ pathway, and inhibition of the YAP/TAZ pathway prevented the development of ITPN. These findings provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of ITPN-derived PDAC and highlight the YAP/TAZ pathway as a potential therapeutic target.
