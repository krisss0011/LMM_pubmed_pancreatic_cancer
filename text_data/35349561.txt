Objective:The objective of the study was to evaluate safety and value of radical resection for unresectable pancreatic cancer (UPC).Materials and methods:Clinical data were analyzed retrospectively. In unresectable group, 360Â° resection of the involved artery sheath, resection and reconstruction of the involved artery, resection and reconstruction of the involved vein as well as resection and reconstruction of combined organs were, respectively, performed. Operation time, intraoperative blood loss, intensive care unit (ICU) transitional treatment, pancreatic fistula, bleeding, reoperation, and survival time were analyzed for two groups.Results:Operation time and intraoperative blood loss were greatly increased in the unresectable group. The incidence of intractable diarrhea and abdominal hemorrhage in the unresectable group was higher. However, the rate of ICU transitional therapy, delayed gastric emptying, and reoperation was lower. Grade C pancreatic fistula occurred in neither group.Conclusions:Surgical treatment through strict selection for patient with UPC is safe and their median survival time is similar to patient with resectable pancreatic cancer.
