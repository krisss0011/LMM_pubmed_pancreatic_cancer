A 78-year-old man came to our department because of obstructive jaundice, and was diagnosed as pancreatic head cancer. He underwent chemoradiation therapy. A metal stent was inserted into the common bile duct and the patient was followed up on an outpatient basis. The patient visited our emergency department 46 days after stent insertion due to abdominal pain. The patient was diagnosed with ruptured pseudoaneurysm of the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery by angiography and treated with coil embolization. He died due to sudden deterioration the next day. Pathological autopsy revealed that the cause of the ruptured pseudoaneurysm appeared to be vasculopathy due to radiation therapy.
