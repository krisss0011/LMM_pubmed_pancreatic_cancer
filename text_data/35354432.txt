Background:Accumulation of the signal adaptor protein p62 has been demonstrated in many forms of cancer, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Although data from experimental studies suggest that p62 accumulation accelerates the development of PDAC, the association between p62 protein expression and survival in PDAC patients is unclear.Methods:Thirty-three tumor specimens from PDAC patients treated by primary surgery were obtained. Immunohistochemical expression of p62, microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3), and nuclear factor-erythroid factor 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) in tumor tissue was examined for associations with clinicopathological characteristics and disease-specific survival (DSS).Results:There was no association between p62 expression and any of the clinicopathological variables. However, high p62 protein expression in tumor cells was significantly associated with shorter DSS (7 months vs. 29 months, p = 0.017). The hazard ratio for death in patients with high p62 protein expression in tumor cells was 2.88 (95% confidence interval: 1.17-7.11, p = 0.022). In multivariable analysis, high p62 expression was an independent prognostic factor for shorter DSS (p = 0.020) when follow up time was more than 5 years. LC3 and NRF2 staining was not associated with survival or other clinicopathological parameters.Conclusion:Our results show that high p62 protein expression in tumor cells is associated with shorter survival following pancreatic tumor resection. This association supports a role for p62 as a prognostic marker in patients with PDAC treated by primary surgery.
