Introduction:Alcohol neurolysis of splanchnic nerves is a valuable tool for treating visceral intractable pain from the upper abdomen in cancer patients. It is a safe and effective procedure, yet not risk free. Itâ€™s most common adverse effects are mild and self-limited.Materials:We present a case of a 72-year old woman suffering from pancreatic cancer with intractable pain despite opioid use. Alcohol neurolysis of splanchnic nerves was indicated after hospital admission.Results:After the procedure pain was subdued, yet hypoxemia, pleural and pericardial effusion developed. Frequent causes for these events were ruled out. The patient was discharged 24 hours after with adequate pain control.Conclusions:Hypoxemia, pleural and pericardial effusion after alcohol neurolysis of splanchnic nerves is infrequent. These findings are likely to be linked to the effect of alcohol.
