Background:Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a fatal malignancy due to the lack of early detection method, therapeutic drug and target. We noticed that the expression of Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Mitochondria1(PTPMT1) is upregulated in PDAC. However, its role in pancreatic cancer remains unknown.Methods:We first analyzed the expression of PTPMT1 from 50 PDAC patients. Secondly, the survival proportions of different PTPMT1-expressed patients were analyzed. Then, the role and mechanism of PTPMT1 in PDAC were studied by lentivirus transduction system.Results:PTPMT1 was upregulated in PDAC and patients with high PTPMT1 expression displayed lower overall survival rate. Knockdown of PTPMT1 increased the sensitivity to erastin or RSL3 induced ferroptosis. Mechanically, knockdown of PTPMT1 resulted in upregulated Acyl-CoA Synthetase Long Chain Family Member 4 (ACSL4) and downregulated Solute Carrier Family 7 Member 11 (SLC7A11). In addition, SLC7A11 was upregulated in PDAC tumor tissue and correlated positively with the expression of PTPMT1. However, the expression of ACSL4 was downregulated in PDAC and negatively correlated with the expression of PTPMT1.Conclusion:Our study demonstrates that PTPMT1 is upregulated in PDAC and PTPMT1 inhibits ferroptosis by suppressing the expression of ACSL4 and upregulating SLC7A11 in Panc-1 cells, suggesting PTPMT1 might be a potential prognosis biomarker and therapeutic target in PDAC.
