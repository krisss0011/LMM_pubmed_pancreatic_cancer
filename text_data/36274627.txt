To develop a superior diagnostic approach for pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAC), the present study prospectively included 338 PAAC patients, 294 normal healthy volunteers (NHV), 122 chronic pancreatitis (CP) patients and 100 patients with non-PAAC malignancies. In the identification phase, HuProt Human Proteome Microarray, comprising 21 065 proteins, was used to identify serum tumor-associated autoantibodies (TAAbs) candidates differentiating PAAC (n = 30) from NHV (n = 30). A PAAC-focused array containing 165 differentially expressed TAAbs identified was subsequently adopted in the validation phase (n = 712) for specificity and sensitivities. The multivariate TAAbs signature for differentiation PAAC from controls (NHV + CP) identified five candidates, namely the IgG-type TAAbs against CLDN17, KCNN3, SLAMF7, SLC22A11 and OR51F2. Multivariate logistic performance model of y = (22.893 × CA19-9 + 0.68 × CLDN17 - 4.012) showed a significant better diagnostic accuracy than that of CA19-9 and CLDN17 in differentiating PAAC from controls (NHV + CP) (AUC = 0.97, 0.92 and 0.82, respectively, P-value < .0001). We further tested the autoantigen level of CLDN17 by ELISA in 82 sera samples from PAAC (n = 42), CP (n = 24) and NHV (n = 16). Similarly, the model showed superior diagnostic performance than that of CA19-9 and CLDN17 (AUC = 0.93, 0.83 and 0.81, respectively, P-value < .0001) in differentiating PAAC from controls. In conclusion, our study is the first to characterize the circulating TAAbs signatures in PAAC. The results showed that CLDN17 combined with CA19-9 provided potentially clinical value and may serve as noninvasive novel biomarkers for PAAC diagnosis.
