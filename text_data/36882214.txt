Objective:Intercellular communication within pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) dramatically contributes to metastatic processes. The underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, resulting in a lack of targeted therapy to counteract stromal-induced cancer cell aggressiveness. Here, we investigated whether ion channels, which remain understudied in cancer biology, contribute to intercellular communication in PDAC.Design:We evaluated the effects of conditioned media from patient-derived cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) on electrical features of pancreatic cancer cells (PCC). The molecular mechanisms were deciphered using a combination of electrophysiology, bioinformatics, molecular and biochemistry techniques in cell lines and human samples. An orthotropic mouse model where CAF and PCC were co-injected was used to evaluate tumour growth and metastasis dissemination. Pharmacological studies were carried out in the Pdx1-Cre, Ink4afl/flLSL-KrasG12D(KICpdx1) mouse model.Results:We report that the K+channel SK2 expressed in PCC is stimulated by CAF-secreted cues (8.84 vs 2.49 pA/pF) promoting the phosphorylation of the channel through an integrin-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-AKT (Protein kinase B) axis. SK2 stimulation sets a positive feedback on the signalling pathway, increasing invasiveness in vitro (threefold) and metastasis formation in vivo. The CAF-dependent formation of the signalling hub associating SK2 and AKT requires the sigma-1 receptor chaperone. The pharmacological targeting of Sig-1R abolished CAF-induced activation of SK2, reduced tumour progression and extended the overall survival in mice (11.7 weeks vs 9.5 weeks).Conclusion:We establish a new paradigm in which an ion channel shifts the activation level of a signalling pathway in response to stromal cues, opening a new therapeutic window targeting the formation of ion channel-dependent signalling hubs.
