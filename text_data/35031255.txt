The treatment of borderline resectable (BR) pancreatic cancer is challenging and requires a multidisciplinary approach with chemotherapy, radiation and surgical resection. Despite using chemotherapy and radiotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting, achievement of negative surgical margins remains technically challenging. Positive margins are associated with increased local recurrences and worse overall survival and there are no standard options for treatment. The CivaSheet is an FDA-cleared implantable sheet with a matrix of unidirectional planar low-dose-rate (LDR) Palladium-103 (Pd-103) sources. The sources are shielded on one side with gold to spare radio-sensitive structures such as the bowel. The sheet can easily be customized and implanted at the time of surgery when there is concern for close or positive margins. The CivaSheet provides an interesting solution to target the region of close/positive margins after pancreatectomy. Here we discuss the physical properties, the dosimetry, clinical workflow and early patient outcomes with the CivaSheet in pancreatic cancer.
