Background/aim:The diagnostic value of serum DUPAN-2 level has been reported; however, the relationship between preoperative DUPAN-2 level and recurrence pattern has not been fully investigated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).Patients and methods:We retrospectively analyzed 50 patients with PDAC who underwent pancreatectomy. The relationships between clinicopathologic factors and site-specific disease-free survival (DFS) were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses.Results:The tumor location was the pancreatic head in 31 patients and the body/tail in 19 patients. Of the 50 patients, 34 had recurrence (median DFS, 11 months). Fifteen patients had hematogenous recurrence, and 16 had locoregional recurrence. In multivariate analysis, adjuvant chemotherapy [p=0.01; odds ratio (OR)=8.10; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.58-41.6] and venous invasion (p=0.01; OR=8.33; 95%CI=1.53-45.4) were significant factors for hematogenous recurrence-free survival, whereas the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (p=0.03; OR=2.57; 95%CI=1.10-5.98) and DUPAN-2 level (p<0.01; OR=1.00; 95%CI=1.000-1.002) were significant factors for locoregional recurrence-free survival. In ROC curve analysis, the area under the curve of DUPAN-2 level was 0.613 for hematogenous recurrence and 0.682 for locoregional recurrence. In the log-rank test, the hematogenous and locoregional recurrence-free survival rates of patients with higher DUPAN-2 levels were significantly worse than those with lower DUPAN-2 level.Conclusion:Elevation of preoperative DUPAN-2 level independently predicts locoregional recurrence after surgery. Patients with elevated preoperative DUPAN-2 level may benefit from neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy to avoid postoperative locoregional recurrence.
