OBJECTIVES: Racial-ethnic disparities in pain management are common but not 
known among pancreatic disease patients. We sought to evaluate racial-ethnic 
disparities in opioid prescriptions for pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer 
patients.
METHODS: Data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey were used to 
examine racial-ethnic and sex differences in opioid prescriptions for ambulatory 
visits by adult pancreatic disease patients.
RESULTS: We identified 207 pancreatitis and 196 pancreatic cancer patient 
visits, representing 9.8 million visits, but weights were repealed for analysis. 
No sex differences in opioid prescriptions were found among pancreatitis (P = 
0.78) or pancreatic cancer patient visits (P = 0.57). Opioids were prescribed at 
58% of Black, 37% of White, and 19% of Hispanic pancreatitis patient visits (P = 
0.05). Opioid prescriptions were less common in Hispanic versus non-Hispanic 
pancreatitis patients (odds ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.91; P = 
0.03). We found no racial-ethnic differences in opioid prescriptions among 
pancreatic cancer patient visits.
CONCLUSIONS: Racial-ethnic disparities in opioid prescriptions were observed in 
pancreatitis, but not pancreatic cancer patient visits, suggesting possible 
racial-ethnic bias in opioid prescription practices for patients with benign 
pancreatic disease. However, there is a lower threshold for opioid provision in 
the treatment of malignant, terminal disease.
