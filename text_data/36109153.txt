Objective:GATA6 is a key regulator of the classical phenotype in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Low GATA6 expression associates with poor patient outcome.GATA4is the second most expressed GATA factor in the pancreas. We assessed whether, and how, GATA4 contributes to PDAC phenotype and analysed the association of expression with outcome and response to chemotherapy.Design:We analysed PDAC transcriptomic data, stratifying cases according toGATA4andGATA6expression and identified differentially expressed genes and pathways. The genome-wide distribution of GATA4 was assessed, as well as the effects ofGATA4knockdown. A multicentre tissue microarray study to assess GATA4 and GATA6 expression in samples (n=745) from patients with resectable was performed. GATA4 and GATA6 levels were dichotomised into high/low categorical variables; association with outcome was assessed using univariable and multivariable Cox regression models.Results:GATA4messenger RNA is enriched in classical, compared with basal-like tumours. We classified samples in 4 groups as high/low forGATA4andGATA6. Reduced expression ofGATA4had a minor transcriptional impact but low expression ofGATA4enhanced the effects ofGATA6low expression. GATA4 and GATA6 display a partially overlapping genome-wide distribution, mainly at promoters. Reduced expression of both proteins in tumours was associated with the worst patient survival.GATA4andGATA6expression significantly decreased in metastases and negatively correlated with basal markers.Conclusions:GATA4andGATA6cooperate to maintain the classical phenotype. Our findings provide compelling rationale to assess their expression as biomarkers of poor prognosis and therapeutic response.
