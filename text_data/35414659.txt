Previous therapeutic attempts to deplete cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) or inhibit their proliferation in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) were not successful in mice or patients. Thus, CAFs may be tumor suppressive or heterogeneous, with distinct cancer-restraining and -promoting CAFs (rCAFs and pCAFs, respectively). Here, we showed that induced expression of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein Meflin, a rCAF-specific marker, in CAFs by genetic and pharmacological approaches improved the chemosensitivity of mouse PDAC. A chemical library screen identified Am80, a synthetic, nonnatural retinoid, as a reagent that effectively induced Meflin expression in CAFs. Am80 administration improved the sensitivity of PDAC to chemotherapeutics, accompanied by increases in tumor vessel area and intratumoral drug delivery. Mechanistically, Meflin was involved in the suppression of tissue stiffening by interacting with lysyl oxidase to inhibit its collagen crosslinking activity. These data suggested that modulation of CAF heterogeneity may represent a strategy for PDAC treatment.
