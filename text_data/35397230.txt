Pancreatic cysts (PC) are an increasingly common problem facing general gastroenterologists and generalists. They can be divided into 3 groups. First, those that have no risk of developing into pancreatic cancer, such as a pseudocyst or serous cystadenomas (SCAs). Second, mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs) and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), which are precursor lesions to high-grade dysplasia and pancreatic cancer. Third, solid cancers of the pancreas, such as neuroendocrine tumors and pancreatic adenocarcinomas, which have undergone cystic degeneration.
