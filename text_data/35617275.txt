Tumors display rich cellular heterogeneity and typically consist of multiple co-existing clones with distinct genotypic and phenotypic characteristics. The acquisition of resistance to chemotherapy has been shown to contribute to the development of aggressive cancer traits, such as increased migration, invasion and stemness. It has been hypothesized that collective cellular behavior and cooperation of cancer cell populations may directly contribute to disease progression and lack of response to treatment. Here we show that the spontaneous emergence of chemoresistance in a cancer cell population exposed to the selective pressure of a chemotherapeutic agent can result in the emergence of collective cell behavior, including cell-sorting, chemoprotection and collective migration. We derived several gemcitabine resistant subclones from the human pancreatic cancer cell line BxPC3 and determined that the observed chemoresistance was driven of a focal amplification of the chr11p15.4 genomic region, resulting in over-expression of the ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) subunit RRM1. Interestingly, these subclones display a rich cell-sorting behavior when cultured as mixed tumor spheroids. Furthermore, we show that chemoresistant cells are able to exert a chemoprotective effect on non-resistant cells in spheroid co-culture, whereas no protective effect is seen in conventional 2D culture. We also demonstrate that the co-culture of resistant and non-resistant cells leads to collective migration where resistant cells enable migration of otherwise non-migratory cells.
