MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known to be involved in the development and progression of pancreatic cancer (PC). In this study, the prognostic significance and mechanistic role of microRNA-569 in PC were explored. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to detect the expression of microRNA-569 in PC tissues and cell lines. Scratch test and Transwell assay were conducted to detect migration and invasion ability. The xenograft nude mice model was used to determine tumor metastasisin vivo. The direct targets of microRNA-569 were determined by using bioinformatics analysis and a dual-luciferase reporter assay. The expression level of microRNA-569 was down-regulated in PC patients with a poor prognosis.In vitroandin vivoexperiments indicated that over-expression of microRNA-569 inhibited the migration and invasion of PC cells. MicroRNA-569 negatively regulated NUSAP1 by directly binding its 3'-untranslated region. Further mechanism research implied that the ZEB1 pathway was involved in microRNA-569/NUSAP1 mediation of the biological behaviors in PC. These data demonstrated that microRNA-569 may exert a tumor-suppressing effect in PC and maybe a potential therapeutic target for PC patients.
