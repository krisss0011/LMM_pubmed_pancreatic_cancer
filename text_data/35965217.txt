Introduction:Resection margin status is a well-established prognosticator in pancreatic cancer. The prognostic impact of IPMN dysplasia at the pancreatic transection margin in IPMN-associated carcinoma (IPMN-Ca) remains unclear, hence institutional practices on additional resections vary.Methods:Patients undergoing partial pancreatectomy or attempted partial pancreatectomy converted to total pancreatectomy for IPMN-Ca between 04/2002 and 12/2018 were identified. Final pathology of the definitive pancreatic transection margin was identified. The association between the presence of IPMN dysplasia at the margin and overall survival (OS) was assessed.Results:Of 302 patients with IPMN-Ca, 181 (59.9%) patients received partial pancreatoduodenectomy, 61 (20.2%) distal pancreatectomy, and 60 (19.9%) were converted to total pancreatectomy. Median OS was 98.6 months in R0 (â‰¥1 mm), 39.3 months in R1 (<1 mm), and 22.0 months in R1(direct) resected patients, respectively (p < 0.0001). No IPMN dysplasia at the definitive margin was present in 103 (34.1%), low-grade in 131 (43.4%), and high-grade/R1 in 8 (2.6%) patients. Low-grade dysplasia or total pancreatectomy were not associated with shorter OS compared to dysplasia-free margin across the entire cohort. Sensitivity analyses confirmed a lack of prognostic relevance of low-grade IPMN dysplasia at the pancreatic margin in R0 resected IPMN-Ca and in R0 resected UICC stage IA/IB IPMN-Ca.Conclusions:Low-grade IPMN at the transection margin is not associated with shorter overall survival after partial pancreatectomy for IPMN-Ca. Additional resections for low-grade dysplasia, up to total pancreatectomy do not result in a survival benefit and should be omitted. Due to limited sample size, high-grade dysplasia could not be analyzed.
