Purpose:Extensive distal pancreatectomy (ExDP) can transect the pancreatic parenchyma more from the right side than conventional distal pancreatectomy (CDP) can. This study aimed to evaluate the short- and long-term outcomes of ExDP for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) of the pancreatic body, located adjacent to the portal vein (PV).Methods:Medical records of 98 patients who underwent ExDP (n = 15) or CDP (n = 83) for PDAC were retrospectively reviewed. Short- and long-term outcomes of the two groups were compared. Propensity score matched analysis was additionally performed to minimize the impact of treatment allocation bias.Results:In the total cohort, the CDP group had a significantly higher proportion of pancreatic tail lesions (P < 0.01), higher proportion of males, and larger tumor size. Of the 15 patients who underwent ExDP, 11 could be matched. These differences of patients' characteristics were not observed after matching. Before and after matching, the duration of surgery, blood loss, rate of morbidity including pancreatic fistula, and postoperative course were comparable between the groups. The rate of recurrence and recurrence pattern were also not significantly different between the groups. ExDP for PDAC of the pancreatic body near the PV did not increase local or lymph node recurrence. The disease-free and overall survival did not differ between the groups.Conclusions:Surgical and oncological outcomes after ExDP for PDAC were acceptable and comparable to those after CDP. ExDP is a feasible procedure, and could be an option for the treatment of PDAC of the pancreatic body near PV.
