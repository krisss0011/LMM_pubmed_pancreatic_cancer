Background:/Objectives: Although the presence of lymph node metastasis (LNM) defines malignant potential, preoperative prediction of LNM has not been established for non-functional pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm (NF-PNEN). We sought to develop a prediction system using only preoperatively available factors that would stratify the risk of LNM for NF-PNEN.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent R0/1 resection of NF-PNEN at Kyoto University (2007-2019) and the University of California, San Francisco (2010-2019). Risk stratification of LNM was developed using preoperative factors by the logistic regression analysis. Long-term outcomes were compared across the risk groups.Results:A total of 131 patients were included in this study. Lymph nodes were pathologically examined in 116 patients, 23 (20%) of whom had LNM. Radiological tumor size [1.5-3.5 cm (odds ratio: 13.5, 95% confidence interval: 1.77-398) and >3.5 cm (72.4, 9.06-2257) against ≤1.5 cm], <50% cystic component (8.46 × 10^6, 1.68 × 10^106-), and dilatation of main pancreatic duct ≥5 mm (31.2, 3.94-702) were independently associated with LNM. When patients were classified as the low-risk (43 patients), intermediate-risk (44 patients), and high-risk groups (29 patients), proportions of LNM differed significantly across the groups (0%, 14%, and 59%, respectively). Recurrence-free survival (RFS) of the low- and intermediate-risk groups were significantly better than that of the high-risk group (5-year RFS rates of 92.2%, 85.4%, and 47.1%, respectively).Conclusions:The prediction system using preoperative radiological factors stratifies the risk of LNM for NF-PNEN. This stratification helps to predict malignant potential and determine the surgical procedure and necessity of regional lymphadenectomy.
