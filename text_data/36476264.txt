Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is one of the leading lethal human cancer types and is notorious for its poor prognosis. A series of bioinformatic analyses and experimental validations were employed to explore the role and mechanism of pseudogene-derived RNAs in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Consequently, a total of 13 upregulated and 7 downregulated pseudogene-derived RNAs in pancreatic adenocarcinoma were identified. Survival analysis revealed a statistically predictive role of AK4P1 for unfavourable prognosis of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Subcellular location analysis indicated that AK4P1 was mainly located in cytoplasm, in which AK4P1 might competitively bind to tumour suppressive miR-375 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Further analysis showed that SP1 was a potential downstream target gene of miR-375 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Intriguingly, expression determination validated that SP1 could positively regulate AK4P1 levels in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Finally, AK4P1 might also exert its effects by interacting with oncogenic parental gene AK4 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Conclusively, the present study elucidated a key regulatory loop AK4P1/miR-375/SP1 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
