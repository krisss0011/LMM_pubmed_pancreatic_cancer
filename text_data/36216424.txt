Introduction:Pancreatic cancer is a leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Screening for this disease has potential to improve survival. It is not feasible, with current screening modalities, to screen the asymptomatic adult population. However, screening of individuals in high-risk groups is recommended. Our study aims to provide resources and data that will inform strategies to screen individuals with new-onset diabetes (NOD) for pancreatic cancer.Methods and analysis:The United Kingdom Early Detection Initiative (UK-EDI) for pancreatic cancer is a national, prospective, observational cohort study that aims to recruit 2500 individuals with NOD (<6 months postdiagnosis) aged 50 years and over, with follow-up every 6 months, over a 3-year period. For study eligibility, diagnosis of diabetes is considered to be clinical measurement of haemoglobin A1c â‰¥48 mmol/mol. Detailed clinical information and biospecimens will be collected at baseline and follow-up to support the development of molecular, epidemiological and demographic biomarkers for earlier detection of pancreatic cancer in the high-risk NOD group. Socioeconomic impacts and cost-effectiveness of earlier detection of pancreatic cancer in individuals with NOD will be evaluated. The UK-EDI NOD cohort will provide a bioresource for future early detection research to be conducted.Ethics and dissemination:The UK-EDI study has been reviewed and approved by the London-West London and GTAC Research Ethics Committee (Ref 20/LO/0058). Study results will be disseminated through presentations at national and international symposia and publication in peer-reviewed, Open Access journals.
