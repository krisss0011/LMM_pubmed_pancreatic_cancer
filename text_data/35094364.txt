Immunocompromised mice are commonly utilized to study pancreatic cancer and other malignancies. The ability to xenograft tumors in either subcutaneous or orthotopic locations provides a robust model to study diverse biological features of human malignancies. However, there is a dire need for large animal models that better recapitulate human anatomy in terms of size and physiology. These models will be critical for biomedical device development, surgical optimization, and drug discovery. Here, we describe the generation and application of immunocompromised pigs lacking RAG2 and IL2RG as a novel model for human xenograft studies. These SCID-like pigs closely resemble NOD scid gamma mice and are receptive to human tumor tissue, cell lines, and organoid xenografts. However, due to their immunocompromised nature, these immunocompromised animals require housing and maintenance under germfree conditions. In this protocol, we describe the use of these pigs in a subcutaneous tumor injection study with human PANC1 cells. The tumors demonstrate a steady, linear growth curve, reaching 1.0 cm within 30 days post injection. The model described here is focused on subcutaneous injections behind the ear. However, it is readily adaptable for other locations and additional human cell types.
