Background and aims:Serum diagnostic markers of early-stage pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are needed, especially for stage I disease. As tumors grow and cause pancreatic atrophy, markers derived from pancreatic parenchyma such as serum carboxypeptidase A (CPA) activity lose diagnostic performance. We evaluated, with CA19-9, serum CPA as a marker of early pancreatic cancer.Methods:Serum CPA activity levels were measured in 345 controls undergoing pancreatic surveillance, divided into 2 sets, set 1 being used to establish a reference range. Variants within the CPA1 locus were sought for their association with pancreatic CPA1 expression to determine if such variants associated with serum CPA levels. A total of 190 patients with resectable PDAC were evaluated.Results:Among controls, those having 1 or more minor alleles of CPA1 variants rs6955723 or rs2284682 had significantly higher serum CPA levels than did those without (P = .001). None of the PDAC cases with pancreatic atrophy had an elevated CPA. Among 122 PDAC cases without atrophy, defining serum CPA diagnostic cutoffs by a subject's CPA1 variants yielded a diagnostic sensitivity of 18% at 99% specificity (95% confidence interval [CI], 11.7-26) (vs 11.1% sensitivity using a uniform diagnostic cutoff); combining CPA with variant-stratified CA19-9 yielded a sensitivity of 68.0% (95% CI, 59.0-76.2) vs 63.1% (95% CI, 53.9- 71.7) for CA19-9 alone; and among stage I PDAC cases, diagnostic sensitivity was 51.9% (95% CI, 31.9-71.3) vs 37.0% (95% CI, 19.4-57.6) for CA19-9 alone. In the validation control set, the variant-stratified diagnostic cutoff yielded a specificity of 98.2%.Conclusion:Serum CPA activity has diagnostic utility before the emergence of pancreatic atrophy as a marker of localized PDAC, including stage I disease.
