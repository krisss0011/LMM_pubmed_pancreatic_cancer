Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a lethal malignancy that threatens human health. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) act as important mediators in PC development. Our study aimed to investigate the function and mechanism of lncRNA ceramide synthase 6 antisense RNA 1 (CERS6-AS1) in PC. As shown by RT-qPCR, CERS6-AS1 was significantly upregulated in PC cells and tissues. Silencing CERS6-AS1 suppressed PC cell viability and proliferation while enhancing cell apoptosis according to colony formation assays, EdU assays, and flow cytometry analyses. Mechanistically, CERS6-AS1 interacted with miR-195-5p to elevate the expression level of the WD repeat domain phosphoinositide interacting 2 (WIPI2), which is a downstream target gene of miR-195-5p in PC. Moreover, miR-195-5p expression was negatively associated with CERS6-AS1 expression (or WIPI2 expression) in PC tissues. Rescue assays revealed that WIPI2 overexpression rescued the effects of CERS6-AS1 deficiency on cell viability, proliferation, and apoptosis. In summary, CERS6-AS1 facilitates PC cell proliferation while inhibiting PC cell apoptosis by upregulating WIPI2 via miR-195-5p. This study might provide promising insight into the role of CERS6-AS1 in PC development.
