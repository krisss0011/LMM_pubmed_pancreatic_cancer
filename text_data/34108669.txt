Immunotherapeutic strategies that combine oncolytic virus (OV) and immune checkpoint inhibitors have the potential to overcome treatment resistance in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), one of the least immunogenic solid tumors. Oncolytic viral chimera, CF33-hNIS-antiPDL1 genetically modified to express anti-human PD-L1 antibody and CF33-hNIS-Δ without the anti-PD-L1 gene, were used to investigate the immunogenic effects of OVs and virus-delivered anti-PD-L1 in PDAC in vitro. Western blot, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence microscopy were used to evaluate the effects of CF33-hNIS-Δ and IFNγ on PD-L1 upregulation in AsPC-1 and BxPC-3 cells, and CF33-hNIS-antiPDL1 production of anti-PD-L1 and surface PD-L1 blockade of AsPC-1 and BxPC-3 with or without cocultured activated T cells. The cytosolic and cell surface levels of PD-L1 in PDAC cell lines varied; only BxPC-3 showed high cell surface expression. Treatment of these cells with CF33-hNIS-Δ and IFNγ significantly upregulated PD-L1 expression and translocation of PD-L1 from the cytosol onto the cell surface. Following coculture of activated T cells and BxPC-3 with CF33-hNIS-antiPDL1, the cell surface PD-L1 blockade on BxPC-3 cells by virus-delivered anti-PD-L1 antibody increased granzyme B release and prevented virus-induced decrease of perforin release from activated CD8+ T cells. Our results suggest that CF33-IOVs can prime immune checkpoint inhibition of PDAC and enhance antitumor immune killing.
