Purpose:[68Ga]Ga-FAPI PET/CT has been widely used in clinical diagnosis and radiopharmaceutical therapy. In this study, tumor-to-blood ratio (TBR) was evaluated as a powerful tool for semiquantitative assessment of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 tumor uptake and as an effective index for tumors with high FAP expression in theranostics.Methods:Nine patients with pancreatic cancer underwent a 60-min dynamic PET/CT scan by total-body PET/CT (with a long AFOV of 194 cm) after injection of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04. After dynamic PET/CT scan, three patients received chemotherapy and underwent the second dynamic scan to evaluate treatment response. Time-activity curves (TACs) were obtained by drawing regions of interest for primary pancreatic lesions and metastatic lesions. The lesion TACs were fitted using four compartment models by the software PMOD PKIN kinetic modeling. The preferred pharmacokinetic model for [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 was evaluated based on the Akaike information criterion. The correlations between simplified methods for quantification of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 (SUVs; tumor-to-blood ratios [TBRs]) and the total distribution volume (Vt) estimates obtained from pharmacokinetic analysis were calculated.Results:In total, 9 primary lesions and 25 metastatic lesions were evaluated. The reversible two-tissue compartment model (2TCM) was the most appropriate model among the four compartment models. The total distribution volume Vtvalues derived from 2TCM varied significantly in pathological lesions and background regions. A strong positive correlation was observed between TBRmeanand Vtfrom the 2TCM model in pathological lesions (R2=0.92, P<0.001). The relative difference range for TBRmeanwas 2.1% compared to the reduction rate of Vtin the patients who were treated with chemotherapy.Conclusions:A strong positive correlation was observed between TBRmeanand Vtfor [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04. TBRmeanreflects FAP receptor density better than SUVmeanand SUVmax, and would be the preferred measurement tool for semiquantitative assessment of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 tumor uptake and as a means for evaluating treatment response.
