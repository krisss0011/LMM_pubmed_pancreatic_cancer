The patient was a 78-year-old man. After 4 courses of GEM plus nab-PTX therapy for multiple recurrent liver metastases after pancreatic body cancer surgery, the patient was aware of general malaise and edema of the extremities. Blood tests showed pancytopenia, and he was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of chemotherapy-induced pancytopenia. On the second day, hemolytic anemia with crushed red blood cells was observed, suggesting thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Considering the possibility of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura(TTP), the patient was started on plasma exchange with steroids. After 7 days of plasma exchange, his thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and renal dysfunction improved, and he was discharged from the hospital on the 28th day. Although GEM-induced TMA is a life-threatening complication, there is no established treatment for it. We report a case of GEM-induced TMA that was successfully treated with plasma exchange.
