Background:Pancreatic resection has higher postoperative mortality and morbidity rates than other abdominal operations. Some centers have reported remarkable postoperative outcomes of minimally invasive surgery. This study investigated the chronological trends of pancreatectomies by analyzing a large-scale database.Methods:The medical records of 5175 patients who underwent pancreatic resection between 1961 and 2019 at a single institution were reviewed. To investigate the chronological change in survival outcomes of periampullary cancer, the survival data of 3,108 patients were analyzed.Results:Patient age and the proportion with pancreatic cancer have increased over time. From 2015 to 2019, pancreatic cancer was the most common cause for resection (35.9%), followed by pancreatic cysts (24.8%) and common bile duct cancer (13.4%). The incidence of postoperative complications tended to decrease over time (26.0% from 2000 to 2004; 20.8% from 2015 to 2019). A comparison of survival outcomes of periampullary malignancies by period revealed that patients with pancreatic cancer significantly improved (5-year survival rate: 14.4% before 2000% vs 15.2% from 2000 to 2009% vs 29.0% after 2009, P < .001).Conclusions:Postoperative outcomes of pancreatic resection have improved over the past few decades. To improve outcomes in the future, an active multidisciplinary approach and postoperative management are required.
