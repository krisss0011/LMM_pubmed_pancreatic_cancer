Abstract
Background Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a devastating cancer due to its poor survival rate, early 
detection, and resectability. This study aimed to determine the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) immune bio-
markers in patients with PDAC and investigate the PDAC-specific peripheral blood biomarker panel and validate its clinical 
performance.
Methods In this prospective, blinded, case–control study, a biomarker panel formula was generated using a development 
cohort—including healthy controls, patients at high risk of PDAC, and patients with benign pancreatic disease, PDAC, or 
other gastrointestinal malignancies—and its diagnostic performance was verified using a validation cohort, including patients 
with ≥ 1 lesion suspected as PDAC on computed tomography (CT).
Results RNA-sequencing of PBMCs from patients with PDAC identified three novel immune cell markers, IL-7R, PLD4, and 
ID3, as specific markers for PDAC. Regarding the diagnostic performance of the regression formula for the three biomarker 
panels, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy were 84.0%, 78.8%, 
47.2%, 95.6%, and 79.8%, respectively. Based on the formula scores for the biomarker panel, the false-negative rate (FNR) 
of the biomarkers was 8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.0–13.0), which was significantly lower than that based on CT in 
the validation cohort (29.2%, 95% CI 20.8–37.6).
Conclusions The regression formula constructed using three PBMC biomarkers is an inexpensive, rapid, and convenient 
method that shows clinically useful performance for the diagnosis of PDAC. It aids diagnoses and differential diagnoses of 
PDAC from pancreatic disease by lowering the FNR compared to CT.

Introduction
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive 
and deadly disease with a mortality rate that closely parallels 
its incidence. Most studies report a mean 5-year-survival 
rate of < 10% [1 –3] due to the fact that PDAC is resistant 
to therapies, and patients are diagnosed when cancer cells 
have already metastasized; most commonly, to the liver, 
lung and/or peritoneum. However, the diagnosis of PDAC 
lacks sensitive or specific biomarkers for early diagnosis [4 , 
5]. Currently used circulating biomarkers, such as CA19-9, 
lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity for diagnostic pur -
poses. Therefore, establishing a non-invasive early detection 
method that can be used for cancer screening is important 
to improve the survival of patients with PDAC. However, 
despite numerous studies, there are still no PDAC-specific 
biomarkers with widespread clinical use [2 , 5, 6].
Liquid biopsy holds great promise as a method for non-
invasive cancer detection, particularly through the analysis 
of cell-free DNA, cell-free RNA fragments, extracellular 
vesicles (particularly exosomes), or circulating tumor cells 
[7, 8]. In cancer patients, these molecules and vesicles are 
released into the circulation by apoptosis, necrosis, and 
active secretion. However, the sensitive detection of usu-
ally very limited amounts of tumor-specific molecules in 
the blood of patients with early-stage cancers remains a 
challenge.
Here, we used complementary approaches, bulk RNA 
sequencing (RNA-seq), and single cell RNA -sequencing 
(scRNA-seq) to investigate the transcriptional landscape of 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and to deter -
mine the specific immune cell markers that may help in the 
differential diagnosis of PDAC from other benign pancreatic and gastrointestinal diseases. Although the peripheral blood 
immune landscapes of individual patients were quite hetero-
geneous, we selected some common PDAC-specific markers 
(e.g., IL-7R, PLD4, and ID3) from the blood samples of 
patients with PDAC that were identified to greatly contrast 
those of healthy controls and patients with benign pancreatic 
diseases, including chronic pancreatitis and cystic disease. 
Clinical performance was found to have remarkable value for 
the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of PDAC from other 
pancreatic diseases through examining these two cohorts. 
In addition, this study showcases differences in the immune 
landscape between PDAC and benign pancreatic diseases, 
which may provide a wealth of hypothesis-generating data 
to benefit pancreatic disease researchers.
Materials and methods
Study design and registration of clinical research
This prospective case–control study was performed using 
two cohorts (Fig.  1). A biomarker panel formula was created 
using a development cohort, and its diagnostic performance 
was verified using a validation cohort. The study proce-
dures were approved by the Institutional Review Board of 
Gangnam Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of 
Medicine, Seoul, Korea (no. 3-2018-0293 and 3-2020-0238) 
and registered at the Clinical Research Information Service 
(https:// cris. nih. go. kr/ cris/ en/; KCT0004614, accessed on 
January 8, 2020). The study was conducted according to 
the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki (2008, amended 
version), and written informed consent was obtained preop-
eratively from each patient and control participant.
Patients selection and inclusion criteria of the study
The development cohort included healthy controls and 
patients with PDAC, high risk of PDAC, benign pancre-
atic disease, and other gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies. 
The high-risk factors for PDAC included chronic pancrea -
titis, pancreatic cyst, pancreatic duct dilatation, DM onset 
over 50 years, and elevated CA19-9 level. PDAC and other 
GI cancers were diagnosed by cytological examination of 
endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fine-needle aspiration 
samples or surgical specimens. Other pancreatic diseases 
were diagnosed by evaluating clinical symptoms and imag-
ing studies (computed tomography [CT], EUS, and mag-
netic resonance imaging). Patients with evidence of serious 
illnesses, immunosuppression, autoimmune or infectious 
diseases, or those taking immunosuppressive drugs were 
excluded.
The inclusion criteria for the validation cohort were 
patients who had been diagnosed with PDAC on CT 2759 Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy (2023) 72:2757–2768 
1 3
(PDAC-positive group) and those who had at least one lesion 
suspected as PDAC based on the results of pancreatic CT 
(pancreatic duct dilatation, focal alteration of parenchymal 
attenuation, parenchymal atrophy, pancreatic duct inter -
ruption, bile duct dilatation, double-duct sign, cystic lesion 
with high malignant stigma, contour abnormality of pancre -
atic parenchyma, and peripancreatic lymphadenopathy) in 
men and women aged > 19 years (PDAC-suspicious group) 
[9–14]. The exclusion criteria were as follows: patients for 
whom a blood sample could not be collected and patients 
with a history of immunosuppressive drug use. In addition, 
inappropriate blood samples were excluded for the follow -
ing reasons: samples suspected of microbial contamination, 
improperly stored samples or storage methods that could not 
be confirmed, and damaged or unlabeled sample containers.
Sample processing and DNA isolation from PBMC
Samples from all cases and controls were processed using 
the method described previously [15]. In brief, peripheral 
blood samples were collected in EDTA vacutainer tubes and processed within 3 h of collection. PBMCs were isolated 
from whole blood by Ficoll Paque Plus density-gradient 
centrifugation, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Total RNA was extracted from PBMCs using QIAzol (QIA -
ZEN) and reverse-transcribed to cDNA using PrimeScript 
RT Master Mix (TaKaRa). For quality control of the yielded 
RNA, the purity and integrity of RNA were evaluated by OD 
260/280 ratio and analyzed using the Agilent 2100 Bioana-
lyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA).
mRNA collection and quantitative RT‑PCR
Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using a PCR 
detection system (StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR; Applied 
Biosystems) and commercial detection kit (Taqman™ Gene 
expression Master Mix; Applied Biosystems) according to 
the manufacturer's instructions. The amplification program 
included an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 10 min, 
followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s and 
annealing and extension at 60 °C for 60 s. Primer sequences 
used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Fig. 1  Schematic flowchart of

Quantitative PCR (qPCR) results were analyzed using the 
comparative Ct method and normalized to glyceraldehyde 
3-phosphate dehydrogenase levels.
mRNA sequencing (mRNA‑seq) and data analysis
The Affymetrix whole-transcript expression array process 
was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions 
(GeneChip Whole Transcript PLUS reagent Kit). cDNA was 
synthesized using the GeneChip Whole Transcript (WT) 
Amplification Kit, according to the manufacturer's instruc-
tions. Sense cDNA was then fragmented and biotin-labeled 
with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase using the Gene-
Chip WT Terminal labeling kit. Approximately 5.5 μg of 
labeled DNA was hybridized to the Affymetrix GeneChip 
human 2.0 ST Array at 45 °C for 16 h. Hybridized arrays 
were washed and stained on GeneChip Fluidics Station 
450 and scanned using the GCS3000 scanner (Affymetrix). 
Signal values were computed using the Affymetrix® Gene-
Chip™ Command Console software.
Bulk RNA‑seq data analysis
Raw read counts were normalized and  log2 fold changes 
(log2FC) of genes between conditions were calculated by 
using the DESeq function of the DESeq2 (v1.34.0) R pack -
age [16] with a design formula considering two factor vari-
ables: condition and sex. To rank and visualize the effect size 
of genes between conditions effectively, shrinkage of effect 
size was calculated per each gene by using the lfcShrink 
function of the same package. For deconvolution analysis, 
protein coding genes were used, except for mitochondrial, 
ribosomal, and gonosomal genes. The posterior sum over 
different cell types defined by the published scRNA-seq data 
[17] was calculated by using the run.prism function of the 
BayesPrism (v2.0) R package [18] with default parameters.
scRNA‑seq data analysis
Count matrices for 4 human normal PBMC scRNA-seq data 
were downloaded [ 17]. Poor-quality cells with log 10-scaled 
counts < 2.5 and percentage of UMIs mapped to mitochon-
dria > 20 were discarded using the percellQCMetrics func-
tion of the scater (v1.18.6) R package [19 ], and a total of 
18,895 cells from 4 samples were used for further analysis. 
Raw UMI counts were normalized in log2-scale using the 
logNormCounts function of scran (v1.18.7) R package [20] 
after removing cell-specific biases by clustering cells and 
calculating cell-specific size factors using the quickClus-
ter and the computeSumFactors of the same R package. 
After decomposing gene-specific variance into biological 
and technical components using the modelGeneVar func-
tion of the same R package, highly variable genes (HVGs) were identified with FDR < 0.05. The top 20 PCs with HVGs 
were calculated for further cell clustering and visualization. 
A Shared Nearest Neighbor (SNN) graph was constructed 
using the FindNeighbors function of Seurat (v4.2.0) R pack -
age [21] with the default parameters. Cells were visualized 
on the two-dimensional UMAP plot using the RunUMAP 
function. After cell type annotation using expression of 
canonical markers based on the reference paper to compare 
relative gene expression among cell types, the normalized 
counts were scaled, and the scaled expression was averaged 
per each cell type.
Immunohistochemical staining
Immunohistochemical staining (IHC) for PLD4 and ID3 was 
performed on 5-μm histological sections that were cut from 
the TMA blocks. PLD4/CD20 and ID3/CD3 immunohisto-
chemical double staining was carried out using a BenchMark 
Ultra IHC/ISH System (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, 
Az) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Antibodies 
for IHC are listed in Supplementary Table 2.
Statistical analysis
Using the development dataset, the study population char -
acteristics are presented as mean ± standard deviation for 
continuous variables and frequencies (percentages) for cate -
gorical variables. Differences between groups were analyzed 
using one-way analysis of variance for continuous variables 
and chi-square tests for categorical variables. Post hoc analy -
ses were conducted using the Bonferroni method. Univariate 
logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the 
association between pancreatic cancer and CA19-9, IL-7R, 
PLD4, and ID3 levels. To construct the biomarker panel, 
multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify 
independent factors, including IL-7R, PLD4, and ID3. Opti-
mal cutoff values for CA19-9, IL-7R, PLD4, ID3, and the 
biomarker panel were determined by calculating Youden’s 
index.
In the development and validation datasets, we assessed 
the performance of CT findings, CA19-9, IL-7R, PLD4, 
ID3, and the biomarker panel. Diagnostic performance was 
evaluated based on sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, posi -
tive predictive values (PPVs), negative predictive values 
(NPVs), and false-negative rate (FNR) values. In this study, 
we used two definitions of FNR. For the development and 
validation datasets with both positive and negative CT find-
ings, we used the classic FNR definition (FN/[TP + FN]). 
For the validation dataset with only negative CT, we defined 
the modified FNR as the percentage of FN in patients with 
negative CT findings (FN/total N). Additionally, receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed, and 2761 Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy (2023) 72:2757–2768 
1 3
AUCs were calculated. A generalized estimation equation 
was used to compare the diagnostic performance.
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS (version 
9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and R (version 4.0.3; 
http:// www.R- proje ct. org, accessed on January 2, 2020). The 
significance level was set at a p-value of < 0.05.
Results
Selection of PDAC‑specific PBMC biomarkers 
from RNA‑seq data
To screen candidate PDAC-specific immunological biomark -
ers from blood samples, we performed RNA-seq on PBMC 
samples from 15 patients with PDAC and 7 healthy controls. 
We identified 616 upregulated and 415 downregulated genes 
in patients with PDAC compared to controls (Fig.  2A). To 
correlate these DEGs with changes in cell type composition 
in patients with PDAC, we re-analyzed the published human 
PBMC scRNA-seq dataset as a single-cell reference. Based 
on 9 distinct cell types and 1 unknown cluster identified 
from the scRNA-seq data (Fig.  2C), we deconvolved each 
bulk RNA-seq sample into 10 cell types using BayersPrism. 
Compared with the control group, the analysis showed that 
CD4 T cells were significantly expanded in patients with 
PDAC (Fig.  2B and Supplementary Fig. 1), suggesting that 
the expansion of CD4 T cells is important in explaining the 
observed DEGs between healthy patients and those with 
PDAC. Therefore, we selected two genes that are upregu-
lated in patients with PDAC and expressed in CD4 T cells 
(IL-7R and ID3) as positive markers. As a negative marker, 
we selected PLD4, which is downregulated in patients with 
PDAC and not expressed in CD4 T cells (Fig.  2D).
To determine whether the selected markers could more 
accurately discriminate PDAC from other benign pancreatic 
diseases and controls, we determined the mRNA expression 
levels of these genes using qPCR in 120 patients. qPCR 
assays of each marker—IL-7R, PLD4, and ID3—revealed 
them as novel PDAC markers (Fig.  2E). The expression of 
IL-7R and its functional role have been recently reported 
[15, 22]. The qPCR assay showed that PLD4 was downregu-
lated and ID3 was significantly upregulated in the PBMCs of 
patients with PDAC. In addition, we confirmed that PLD4- 
and ID3-expressing immune cells infiltrated PDAC tissues 
(Fig.  2F).
Demographic and laboratory data of the developing 
cohort population
To determine the clinical performance of these three mark -
ers, we constructed a clinical cohort. Of the 552 screened 
patients, 250 were excluded (e.g., due to incomplete dataset), and 272 patients were enrolled in the development cohort 
and their data were analyzed (Fig.  3). These patients were 
classified into five groups: PDAC (n  = 50), healthy controls 
(n = 61), high-risk group (n  = 56), benign pancreatic disease 
(n = 51), and other GI malignancies (n  = 54). Demographic 
characteristics were not significantly different between the 
PDAC, healthy controls, high-risk, benign pancreatic dis-
ease, and other GI malignancy groups, except that the PDAC 
group and other GI malignancy groups were older than the 
other groups (Supplementary Table 3). Bilirubin, aspartate 
transaminase, alanine transferase, and CA19-9 levels were 
higher in the PDAC group than in the other groups owing 
to biliary obstruction by PDAC. CA19-9 levels were also 
higher in the PDAC group than in the other groups.
Among the selected biomarkers, IL-7R mRNA levels 
were significantly higher in the PDAC group than in the 
other groups. PLD4 mRNA levels were significantly down-
regulated and ID3 mRNA levels were significantly higher in 
the PDAC group than in the other groups.
Formula and diagnostic performance 
of the biomarker panel
The expression of CA19-9 in serum and mRNA level of 
three markers (IL-7R, PLD4, and ID3) in PBMC was sig-
nificantly different between PDAC and non-PDAC (Supple-
mentary Table 4). Furthermore, the IL-7R, PLD4, and ID3 
markers were statistically significant both in the univariate 
and multivariate models for differentiating pancreatic can -
cer from non-pancreatic cancer. Therefore, combinations of 
these three biomarkers were used to establish the formula 
for the biomarker panel.
The AUC for the biomarker panel was significantly higher 
than that for IL-7R, PLD4, and ID3 (Fig.  4). However, the 
AUC for CA19-9 was not different from that of the bio-
marker panel. The diagnostic performance of the biomarker 
panel was superior to that of each marker alone in the devel-
opment cohort (Table  1). The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, 
NPV, and accuracy of the biomarker panel were 84.0%, 
78.8%, 47.2%, 95.6%, and 79.8%, respectively. Notably, 
these values were significantly higher than those for IL-7R 
(66%, 56.8%, 25.6%, 88.1%, and 58.5%, respectively), PLD4 
(90%, 52.3%, 29.8%, 95.9%, and 59.2%, respectively), and 
ID3 (62%, 71.6%, 33%, 89.3%, and 69.9%, respectively)

Patient characteristics and diagnostic performance 
in the validation cohort
Of the 195 screened patients, 39 were excluded, and 156 
patients were enrolled in the validation cohort and their data 
were analyzed (Fig.  5). These patients included those with 
PDAC ( n = 76), high-risk of PDAC ( n = 38), benign pan-
creatic disease (n  = 28), and other malignancies (n  = 14). 
Patients were classified into PDAC-positive ( n = 43) and 
PDAC-suspicious (n  = 113) groups according to the CT 
results (Supplementary Table 5). There were no differences 
in patient characteristics between the two groups, except 
that the biomarker panel levels of the PDAC-positive group 
were significantly higher than those of the PDAC-suspicious 
group (p  = 0.001). The proportion of patients diagnosed with 
PDAC was 100% (43/43) in the PDAC-positive group and 
29.2% (33/113) in the PDAC-suspicious group.
The diagnostic performance of the biomarker panel in 
the validation cohort did not differ from that in the devel-
opment cohort (Table  2). The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, 
NPV, and accuracy for the biomarker panel were 80.3%, 
78.8%, 78.2%, 80.8%, and 79.5%, respectively. However, the 
diagnostic performance in terms of sensitivity of CA19-9 in 
the validation cohort was lower than that in the development 
cohort (56.6 vs. 76.0).
Abnormal findings on abdominal CT 
in PDAC‑suspicious group
Abnormal findings on abdominal CT in patients in the vali-
dation cohort are summarized in Supplementary Table 6. 
The most common abnormal CT finding was focal altera-
tion of parenchymal attenuation, which was identified in 76 
patients (67.3%). Other findings included pancreatic duct 
dilatation in 39 patients, cystic lesions with high malignant 
stigma in 28 patients, parenchymal atrophy in 27 patients, 
contour abnormality of the pancreatic parenchyma in 18 
patients, peripancreatic lymphadenopathy in 18 patients, bile duct dilatation in 12 patients, double-duct sign in 12 
patients, and pancreatic duct interruption in 1 patient. There 
were cases of multiple abnormal CT findings in one patient, 
and the mean number of findings was 2.04 ± 0.87.
Application of the biomarker panel 
in PDAC‑suspicious group
Based on the formula scores for the biomarker panel, the 
113 patients with suspected PDAC on abdominal CT were 
divided into high-risk (positive, Pr ≥ 0.22016) and low-
risk (negative, Pr < 0.22016) groups. Of the 41 high-risk 
cases, 24 (58.5%) were PDAC cases and 17 (41.5%) were 
benign cases. The 72 low-risk cases included 9 (12.5%) 
PDAC cases and 63 (87.5%) benign cases. The sensitivity, 
specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy for the biomarker panel 
were 72.7%, 78.8%, 58.5%, 87.5%, and 77%, respectively 
(Table  3). Among the 113 patients who were negative for 
PDAC based on CT, 33 patients were diagnosed with PDAC. 
Therefore, the FNR of CT was 29.2% (95% confidence inter -
val [CI] 20.8–37.6). Nine patients with PDAC were diag-
nosed from the 113 patients who tested negative based on 
the biomarker panel, and the FNR of the biomarkers was 8% 
(95% CI 3.0–13.0), which was 72.4% lower than the FNR 
of CT (p  < 0.001).
Discussion
Molecular biomarkers for cancer diagnosis can be classi-
fied as direct or indirect. Direct biomarkers are related to 
or are segments of tumor tissues (e.g., tumor DNA and 
RNA). However, indirect biomarkers could be reminiscent 
of known or unknown factors implicated in the dysregulation 
of cell functions. PBMCs have emerged as a novel source 
of biomarkers in various disorders, including inflammatory 
diseases and cancers [23– 25]. PBMCs may mimic the condi-
tions of some tissues they are in direct contact with, such as 
tumor cells [24]. Recent experiments have shown that gene 
expression and methylation profiles in PBMCs are altered 
in the presence of malignancies, such as non-small-cell 
lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, breast cancer, and other 
cancers. [24, 26, 27] In light of this idea, we investigated 
peripheral blood markers for cancer detection using recent 
sophisticated detection tools (RNA-seq and scRNA-seq).
Local paracrine effects and crosstalk between tumor cells 
and immune cells are important factors in tumor growth and 
suppression; however, immunity is coordinated across tis -
sues. For example, many myeloid cells are frequently replen-
ished from hematopoietic precursors in the bone marrow 
[28], and critical T-cell priming events typically occur in 
lymphoid tissues [29]. Recent clinical and preclinical studies 
are unravelling the range of systemic immune perturbations Fig. 2  Determination of PDAC-specific PBMC marker selection. A.

that occur during tumor development, as well as the crucial 
contribution of peripheral immune cells to an anti-tumor 
immune response. Therefore, we sought to identify immune 
biomarkers for PDAC. Although biomarkers are found in 
the blood, their detection remains challenging due to the 
high degree of fragmentation, minute quantity, and large 
amount of non-specific background [7 , 8]. In this context, we 
attempted to find a more stable and intact source of biomark -
ers and identified three markers from PBMCs as a target 
source for biomarker detection [25, 30].
IL-7R is a well-known marker for some T cells, includ-
ing naive and stem cell memory T cells [31– 33]. Our team 
recently reported that the IL-7R level is elevated in blood 
cells from patients with PDAC, especially in the early stages 
of the disease. Although this study focused on the detection 
and validation of biomarkers, the molecular and biologi-
cal mechanisms were not investigated. However, consider -
ing the hypothesis of tumor immune surveillance [34], it is 
reasonable that the IL-7R level in T cells is elevated in the 
early period of PDAC. From the scRNA-seq data, PLD4 was 
highly expressed in B cells and monocytes from patients 
with PBMC (Fig.  2B). Although not much data have been 
published on the role of PLD4 in cancer, PLD4 has been 
reported as a critical factor for tumor as it plays an important 
role in anti-tumor activities in colon cancer [35] and renal 
fibrosis [36]. To the best of our knowledge, no study has 
reported the role of PLD4 in PDAC development. However, 
we found that PLD4 levels were downregulated in PDAC 
and well correlated with tumor stage (data not shown). ID3

is a member of the ID family of helix-loop-helix proteins 
and lacks a basic DNA-binding domain that is known to 
inhibit transcription. ID3 is highly expressed in B and T cells 
[37, 38], especially Th1 type cells [38] and tissue-resident 
regulatory T cells [39]. Similar to previous studies, ID3 was 
significantly elevated in T and B plasma cells in PMBCs 
from patients with PDAC. Few studies have investigated 
the role of PLD4 and ID3 in tumor growth and inhibition, 
especially PDAC. Therefore, future studies investigating 
the precise expression pattern (e.g., expression pattern with 
tumor growth) and functional role of those markers (e.g., 
prognostic role) are required.
We believe that these three indirect tumor markers have 
three clinical values. First, the biomarker panel can improve the FNR of abdominal CT and CA19-9 level; the combina-
tion of CT and the biomarker panel reduced the FNR to 8.0% 
(Table  3). Considering most patients with suspected PDAC 
had undergone abdominal CT, it is impressive that this sim -
ple and 1-day blood cell examination significantly improved 
diagnostic value. Second, these marker levels were selec-
tively higher in relatively early cases that did not have ele-
vated CA19-9 levels. Using qPCR data from these markers, 
21 (42.3%) CA19-9-negative cancer cases were clinically 
confirmed as PDAC cases. It is well-known that CA19-9 
levels are elevated in late-stage disease and correlate with 
mass size [40– 42]. Therefore, it is meaningful that the three-
marker test positively identified non-diagnostic cases based 
on CA19-9 level and abdominal CT findings. Although the Table 2  Diagnostic performance of multi-panel biomarkers and CA19-9 for pancreatic adenocarcinoma in validation cohort

survival rate of patients with PDAC is extremely low and 
has not improved in recent decades, accurate diagnosis at an 
early stage significantly improves the prognosis. Recently, 
Hanaeda et al. reported an improved 5-year-survival of up 
to 80% when the cancer size was < 10 mm [4 , 43]. Finally, 
because the test is based on the qPCR assay, it can be eas-
ily and quickly performed at any laboratory; improving the 
convenience of the diagnostic process both for physicians 
and patients.
This study has several limitations. The regression equa-
tion markers were developed from the development cohort, 
their efficacy was determined in a separate verification 
cohort, and the exact functional role of the markers was not 
well investigated. Although we found that IL-7R, PLD4, 
and ID3 are differently expressed in human PBMC of PDAC 
patients, the functional role of marker-expressing immune 
cells, spatiotemporal relationship of the markers in tumor 
development, and precise mechanisms for marker upregula-
tion remain unclear. As interest in the immune environment 
of tumor progression is still in its infancy for most malig-
nancies, these unsolved issues should be addressed in the 
future. In addition, whether tumor-induced immunity sup-
presses tumorigenesis or supports tumor growth is context-
dependent; ultimately, the global immune landscape beyond 
the tumor is significantly altered during tumor progression 
[44]. Over the last few decades, immunotherapy has revolu-
tionized cancer therapy, such as anti-CTLA4, anti-PD1, and 
anti-PDL1. Therefore, although our PBMC marker data are 
helpful and may be useful for clinical PDAC diagnosis, the 
levels of the markers should be monitored and determined 
in a time-dependent manner. This will allow the changes in 
marker levels to be fully understood and the true value of 
the regression equation of the three-marker combination to 
be determined.
Conclusion
We found PDAC-specific PBMC markers that are upregu-
lated in PDAC cases and can be easily measured by small-
volume blood sampling. The logistic equation developed by 
combining PBMC-related immune markers from patients 
with PDAC aided the differential diagnosis of indeterminate 
PDAC cases, reduced FNR of abdominal CT and CA19-9 
level, and improved predictability for PDAC diagnosis.
