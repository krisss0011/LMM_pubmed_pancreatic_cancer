microRNA-331-3p (miR-331-3p) has been displayed as an oncogene in pancreatic cancer (PC). The current research set out to elucidate how miR-331-3p in carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) facilitated the tumorigenesis in PC. First, a dual-luciferase reporter assay was adopted to investigate the relationship between miR-331-3p and SCARA5. In addition, EVs were isolated normal fibroblasts and CAFs, and these isolated EVs were co-cultured with PC cells. Cell proliferative and migrating/invasive potentials were further evaluated with the help of a CCK-8 and Transwell assays, respectively. Gain- and loss-of-function assays were also implemented to assess the role of miR-331-3p, SCARA5, and FAK pathway in PC cells. Lastly, xenograft nude mice were established to investigate the role of miR-331-3pin vivo. miR-331-3p negatively targeted SCARA5 and was highly expressed in CAFs-derived EVs, which accelerated the proliferative, migrating, and invasive potentials of PC cells. Meanwhile, over-expression of miR-331-3p enhanced the proliferative, migrating, and invasive properties of PC cells and promoted tumor growthin vivoby manipulating SCARA5/FAK axis, whereas SCARA5 countered the oncogenic effects of miR-331-3p. Overall, miR-331-3p in CAFs-derived EVs inhibits SCARA5 expression and activates the FAK pathway, thereby augmenting the progression of PC. Our study provides a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of PC.
