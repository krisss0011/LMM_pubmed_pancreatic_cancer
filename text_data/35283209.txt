Cancer neuroscience has emerged as a burgeoning field for the investigation of cancer-nervous system interactions. Perineural invasion (PNI) is defined as the presence of cancer cells that surround and/or invade the nerves infiltrating the tumor microenvironment. PNI is closely associated with increased tumor recurrence and diminished survival in many cancer types. Based on diverse in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo models, mounting evidence suggests that the reciprocal crosstalk between nerves and cancer cells drives PNI, which is mediated by several factors including secreted neurotrophins, chemokines, exosomes, and inflammatory cells. Typical in vitro models using dorsal root ganglia (DRG) cells cocultured with cancer cells or other cell types allow the study of isolated factors. Ex vivo PNI models created by cocultivating cancer cells with explanted vagus and sciatic nerves enable the study of neuroaffinity in a time-saving and cost-efficient manner. In vivo models such as genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) and the chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM)-DRG model, provide the nerve microenvironment needed to recapitulate the complex pathophysiological processes of PNI. Here, we summarize the current methods commonly used for modeling PNI and discuss the inherent pros and cons of these approaches for understanding PNI biology.
