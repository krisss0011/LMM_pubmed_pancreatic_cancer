Introduction:Surgery and chemotherapy have increased the survival of pancreatic cancer. The decrease in postoperative morbidity and mortality and increase in life expectancy, has expanded the indications por cephalic pancreaticoduodenectomy (PDC), although it remains controversial in the geriatric population.Methods:Retrospective study on a prospective database of patients with ductal adenocarcinoma of pancreas who underwent PDC between 2007-2018. The main objective was to analyse the morbidity-mortality and survival associated with PDC in patients ≥75 years (elderly).Results:79 patients were included, 21 of them older than 75 years (27%); within this group, 23'9% were over 80 years old. The ASA of both groups was similar. Patients ≥75 years required more transfusions. No differences in operating time were observed, although more vascular resection were performed in the elderly (26 vs. 8.7%; P = .037). Morbidity was higher in the elderly (61.9% vs. 46.6%), although without differences. Patients aged ≥75 years had more non-surgical complications (33.3%, P = .050), being pneumonia the most frequent. Postoperative mortality was higher in the ≥75 years (9 vs. 0%; P = .017). The overall survival and disease-free survival did not show significant differences in both groups.Conclusions:Elderly patients had higher postoperative mortality and more non-surgical complications. Survival did not show differences, so with an adequate selection of patients, age should not be considered itself as a contraindication for PDC.
