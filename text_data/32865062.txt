Objective:To compare the efficacy and safety of iodine-125 seed interstitial brachytherapy and local chemotherapy perfusion in treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.Methods:The present open prospective randomized control study included a total of 165 cases of advanced pancreatic cancer patients who were admitted in our hospital during December 2016 to April 2019. All patients were randomized into two groups with 84 cases in iodine-125 group and 81 cases in chemotherapy perfusion group. Basic clinical characteristics and demographic data were collected. The main outcome was the tumor efficiency. The pain condition was measured by visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Karnofsky score was also measured at different time points, before the treatment, 1 d, 7 d, 14 d, 1 mon, 2 mon and 3 mon after treatment. Serum levels of CEA, CA19-9 and CA50 were measured by immunochemiluminescence. The overall survival was analyzed by K-M curve.Results:The ratio of partial remission patients was significantly higher, and the ratio of stable disease (SD)+progressive disease patients was also remarkably lower in iodine-125 group than the chemotherapy perfusion group. The mean VAS scores decreased markedly after treatment and were significantly lower and the mean Karnofsky scores were remarkably higher in iodine-125 group than the chemotherapy perfusion group. The levels of CA19-9 and CA50 were remarkably lower in iodine-125 group, however no significant difference was found for CEA. The survival analysis by K-M curve showed the iodine-125 patients had longer overall survival time than the chemotherapy perfusion group. No infection, pancreatic fistula, biliary fistula, intestinal fistula, gastrointestinal obstruction or radiation enteritis was found in both groups.Conclusion:Iodine-125 seed interstitial brachytherapy could achieve better efficacy with no increased side complications than chemotherapy perfusion in advanced pancreatic cancer.
