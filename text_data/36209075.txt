Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a malignant tumor with invasive and metastatic characteristics and poor prognosis. Intracellular protein homeostasis is associated with invasion and metastasis of pancreatic cancer, but the specific molecular mechanism remains unclear. Our previous studies have revealed that DNAJB11, a key protein in protein homeostasis, is secreted by exosomes in the supernatant of dissociated pancreatic cancer cells with high metastasis. The results from transcriptome sequencing and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP)-based liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) showed that depletion of DNAJB11 levels could increase HSPA5 expression and induce endoplasmic reticulum stress through the PRKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase signaling pathway in pancreatic cancer cells. Furthermore, exosomal DNAJB11 promoted cell development of PC cells in vitro and in vivo. In addition, exosomal DNAJB11 could regulate the expression of EGFR and activate the downstream MAPK signaling pathway. Clinical blood samples were collected to evaluate the potential of exosome DNAJB11 as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. This study could provide a new theoretical basis and potential molecular targets for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
