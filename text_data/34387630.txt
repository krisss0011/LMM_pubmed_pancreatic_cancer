Juvenile xanthogranuloma (JXG) is a rare, non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis. It is usually a benign and self-limiting condition. The most common sites are skin and soft tissue. Pancreatic involvement is extremely rare. We present an unusual case of a 13-month-old female child with JXG of the pancreas and elevated cancer antigen 19-9. JXG should always be considered as a differential diagnosis for pediatric patients presenting with a pancreatic mass, solid and/or cystic in nature. Therefore, avoiding unnecessary invasive diagnostic procedures.
