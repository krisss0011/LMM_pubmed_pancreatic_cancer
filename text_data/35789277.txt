Advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (paNET) are mostly characterized by infiltration of vascular structures and/or neighboring organs. The indications for resection in these cases should be measured based on the possibility of an R0 resection. Although the data situation for this rare entity is limited, small case series have shown a significant survival advantage in patients who underwent a radical resection in locally advanced stages of paNET. Both vascular reconstruction and multivisceral resection, when performed at experienced centers, should be considered as curative treatment options. The very special biological behavior of the paNET and the often young patient age justify a much more aggressive approach compared to the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
