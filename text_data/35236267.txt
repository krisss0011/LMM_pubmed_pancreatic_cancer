Introduction:Metastasis of primary pancreatic cancer (PC) to adjacent or distant organs is responsible for the poor survival rate of affected individuals. Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy are currently being prescribed to treat PC in addition to surgical resection. Surgical resection is the preferred treatment for PC that leads to 20% of 5-year survival, but only less than 20% of patients are eligible for surgical resection because of the poor prognosis. To improve the prognosis and clinical outcome, early diagnostic markers need to be identified, and targeting them would be of immense benefit to increase the efficiency of the treatment. Cell migration-inducing hyaluronan-binding protein (CEMIP) is identified as an important risk factor for the metastasis of various cancers, including PC. Emerging studies have pointed out the crucial role of CEMIP in the regulation of various signaling mechanisms, leading to enhanced migration and metastasis of PC.Methods:The published findings on PC metastasis, phytoconstituents, and CEMIP were retrieved from Pubmed, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane Library. Computational tools, such as gene expression profiling interactive analysis (GEPIA) and Kaplan-Meier (KM) plotter, were used to study the relationship between CEMIP expression and survival of PC individuals.Results:Gene expression analysis using the GEPIA database identified a stupendous increase in the CEMIP transcript in PC compared to adjacent normal tissues. KM plotter analysis revealed the impact of CEMIP on the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) among PC patients. Subsequently, several risk factors associated with PC development were screened, and their ability to regulate CEMIP gene expression was analyzed using computational tools.Conclusion:The current review is focused on gathering information regarding the regulatory role of phytocomponents in PC migration and exploring their possible impact on the CEMIP expression.
