Purpose:Pancreatic solid pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPNs) are rare borderline tumours mainly affecting young female patients. The number of patients diagnosed with SPNs has increased significantly in the last decades owing to the increased use of cross-sectional imaging investigating different abdominal symptoms, whilst a significant proportion are incidentally discovered during the process of evaluating other pathologies. We herein present our institutional experience of patients with SPN who underwent curative resection focusing on clinical, pathological features, and the long-term outcomes.Methods:All patients undergoing pancreatectomy in our institution for SPN from January 2010 until December 2018 were included. Clinical, perioperative, histological, and long-term outcomes were collected and analysed.Results:During the inclusion period, a total of 19 patients had a pathological diagnosis of SPNs after surgical resection. Sixteen of them were female (84%), while the median patient age was 30 (range 16-66) years. Nine patients (47%) underwent distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy, 2 (11%) underwent spleen preserving distal pancreatectomy, 6 (32%) underwent pancreatoduodenectomy, one (5%) underwent total pancreatectomy, and one (5%) central pancreatectomy. Seventeen patients underwent R0 resection. During a median follow-up of 23 months, no tumour recurrence or death was recorded.Conclusion:In our experience, SPNs are rare tumours with low malignant potentials. Surgical resection remains the gold standard treatment and is associated with good prognosis.
