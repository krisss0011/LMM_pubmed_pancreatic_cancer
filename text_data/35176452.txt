Despite the importance of metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells, the molecular mechanism regulating the tumor metabolic shift is still poorly understood. Deregulation of Jumonji-C domain-containing protein 5 (JMJD5) has been associated with multiple facets of biological processes in cancer cells. However, the role of JMJD5 in pancreatic cancer cells has seldom been discussed and requires further investigation. In the present study, by silencing or overexpressing JMJD5 in pancreatic cancer cells, we examined the impact of JMJD5 on cell proliferation and glucose metabolism. Using a dual luciferase assay, we assessed the effect of JMJD5 on the transcriptional activity of the c-Myc target gene. Analyzing The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Gene Expression Omnibus datasets revealed that low JMJD5 expression was associated with poor prognosis in patients with pancreatic cancer. JMJD5 loss promoted pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and induced a cellular metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis. In addition, in vivo experiments confirmed that ectopic JMJD5 expression inhibited cancer cell growth and the expression of glycolytic enzymes, such as lactate dehydrogenase and phosphoglycerate kinase 1. Moreover, JMJD5 negatively regulated c-Myc expression, the main regulator of cancer metabolism, leading to decreased c-Myc-targeted gene expression. Overall, the present study indicated that decreased JMJD5 expression promoted cell proliferation and glycolytic metabolism in pancreatic cancer cells in a c-Myc-dependent manner.
