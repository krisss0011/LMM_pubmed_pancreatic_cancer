Pancreatic duct adenocarcinoma, commonly known as pancreatic cancer (PC), is a cancer-related cause of death due to delayed diagnosis, metastasis, and drug resistance. Patients with PC suffer from incorrect responses to chemotherapy due to inherent and acquired chemical resistance. Numerous studies have shown the mechanism of the effect of chemoresistance on PC, such as genetic and epigenetic changes or the elucidation of signaling pathways. In this regard, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified as essential modulators of gene expression in various cellular functions, including chemoresistance. Thus, identifying the underlying link between microRNAs and PC chemoresistance helps determine the exact pathogenesis of PC. This study aims to classify miRNAs and signaling pathways related to PC chemoresistance, suggesting new therapeutic approaches to overcome PC chemoresistance.
