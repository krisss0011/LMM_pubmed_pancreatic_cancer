Rationale:Pancreatic mixed serous neuroendocrine neoplasm (PMSNN) is an extremely rare disease. Only a few cases on the surgical treatment of PMSNN have been reported in the literature, and it is unclear whether there is invasion of important peripancreatic vessels.Patient concerns:We report the case of a 39-year-old female patient with PMSNN accompanied by invasion of important peripancreatic vessels. She underwent surgery and achieved satisfactory recovery.Diagnosis:Abdominal enhanced CT images showed an enhanced mass with a nonenhanced cyst involving the head and body of the pancreas, which invaded important peripancreatic vessels. The lesion had been misdiagnosed and mistreated as a metastatic carcinoma before admission.Interventions:CT 3-dimensional (3D) visualization reconstruction images showed intact peripancreatic vessels. Radical pancreatoduodenectomy was successfully performed and confirmed that the main blood vessels around the pancreas were only compressed or even wrapped by the mass, but not penetrated.Outcomes:The patient recovered well and was discharged on the 19th day after surgery. Pathological examination reported the diagnosis of PMSNN with the collision type combination and the well-differentiated grade 2 pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. She was followed up for 18 months without any abnormalities.Lessons:This case demonstrates that surgical treatment of PMSNN with invasion of peripancreatic vessels can be successful. Preoperative abdominal CT 3D visualization reconstruction is helpful in determining the degree of invasion of important peripancreatic vessels, and plays a key role in formulating an accurate surgical plan and improving patient outcome.
