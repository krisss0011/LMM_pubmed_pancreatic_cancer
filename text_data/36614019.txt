High rates of cell proliferation and protein synthesis in pancreatic cancer are among many factors leading to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. To restore cellular homeostasis, the unfolded protein response (UPR) activates as an adaptive mechanism through either the IRE1Î±, PERK, or ATF6 pathways to reduce the translational load and process unfolded proteins, thus enabling tumor cells to proliferate. Under severe and prolonged ER stress, however, the UPR may promote adaptation, senescence, or apoptosis under these same pathways if homeostasis is not restored. In this review, we present evidence that high levels of ER stress and UPR activation are present in pancreatic cancer. We detail the mechanisms by which compounds activate one or many of the three arms of the UPR and effectuate downstream apoptosis and examine available data on the pre-clinical and clinical-phase ER stress inducers with the potential for anti-tumor efficacy in pancreatic cancer. Finally, we hypothesize a potential new approach to targeting pancreatic cancer by increasing levels of ER stress and UPR activation to incite apoptotic cell death.
