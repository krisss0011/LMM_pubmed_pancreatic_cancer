Background:Pancreatobiliary MRI is often recommended for patients at risk of developing pancreas cancer. But the surveillance MRI protocol has not yet been widely accepted.Purpose:To establish an accelerated MRI protocol targeting the table time of 15 minutes for pancreatic cancer surveillance and test its performance in lesion characterization.Study type:Prospective.Population:A total of 30 participants were enrolled, who were undergoing follow-up care for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms or newly diagnosed pancreatic cysts (≥10 mm) and were scheduled for or had recently undergone contrast-enhanced CT (CECT).Field strength/sequence:A 3 T; heavily T2WI, 3D MRCP, DWI, dynamic T1WI, two-point Dixon.Assessment:In-room time and table time were measured. Seven radiologists independently reviewed image quality of MRI and then the presence of high-risk stigmata and worrisome features in addition to diagnostic confidence for accelerated MRI, CECT, and the noncontrast part of accelerated MRI (NC-MRI).Statistical analysis:Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables and either the Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney test was performed for continuous variables. The generalized estimated equation was used to compare the diagnostic performance of examinations on a per-patient basis. Interobserver agreement was evaluated via Fleiss kappa. A P value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.Results:The in-room time was 18.5 ± 2.6 minutes (range: 13.7-24.9) and the table time was 13.9 ± 1.9 minutes (range: 10.7-17.5). There was no significant difference between the diagnostic performances of the three examinations (pooled sensitivity: 75% for accelerated MRI and CECT, 68% for NC-MRI, P = 0.95), with the highest significant diagnostic confidence for accelerated MRI (4.2 ± 0.1). With accelerated MRI, the interobserver agreement was fair to excellent for high-risk stigmata (κ = 0.34-0.98).Data conclusion:Accelerated MRI protocol affords a table time of 15 minutes, making it potentially suitable for cancer surveillance in patients at risk of developing pancreatic cancer.Evidence level:2 TECHNICAL EFFICACY STAGE: 2.
