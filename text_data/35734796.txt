Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the 11th most common malignancy worldwide, however, entailing a mortality in excess of 90% within 5 years from diagnosis, it is the 4th most fatal malignant disease. PC is commonly diagnosed at an advanced stage, in which curative resection is no longer possible. Even patients who present with potentially curable disease will have upward of 30% recurrence of their disease within the first year. Thus, palliative therapy has paramount importance in patient management. The purpose of palliative care in these patients is to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life. This article reviews the current state of invasive palliation techniques for advanced PC, which are commonly directed towards three main symptoms: gastric/duodenal obstruction, obstructive jaundice, and epigastric pain. We describe the pros and cons of the different techniques, along with current front-line technology advancements. Endoscopic stenting is highly efficient in patients with gastric/duodenal obstruction or obstructive jaundice, with a generally low complication rate, short hospitalization and sustained quality of life. Bypass surgery should be considered in patients with a long-anticipated life expectancy, following higher rates of long-term stent failure, or when endoscopic stent procedure is not possible or has failed. When treating abdominal pain, celiac plexus neurolysis is considered as the first-line treatment. Pancreatic cancer is a complex and commonly lethal disease strongly affecting patient quality of life. It is important to consider the specific patient's personal characteristics and disease status when planning their palliative care.
