Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most prevalent malignant pancreatic tumor. Few studies have shown how often PDACs arise from cystic precursor lesions. This special report aims to summarize the evidence on the progression of precancerous lesions to PDAC. A review of the literature found four studies that discussed pancreatic intraepithelial lesions (PanINs), three that discussed mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCN) and five that discussed intraductal papillary neoplasms (IPMNs). PanINs were the most common precursors lesion, with approximately 80% of PDACs originating from this lesion. The lack of evidence characterizing the features of PDAC precursor cystic lesions potentially leads to a subset of patients undergoing surgery unnecessarily. Advancements in molecular techniques could allow the study of cystic lesions at a genetic level, leading to more personalized management.
