Obesity is a global epidemic and a major predisposing factor for cancer. Increasing evidence shows that obesity-associated stress is a key driver of cancer risk and progression. Previous work has identified the phase-separation organelles, stress granules (SG), as mutant KRAS-dependent mediators of stress adaptation. However, the dependence of tumorigenesis on these organelles is unknown. Here, we establish a causal link between SGs and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Importantly, we uncover that dependence on SGs is drastically heightened in obesity-associated PDAC. Furthermore, we identify a previously unknown regulator and component of SGs, namely, the serine/arginine protein kinase 2 (SRPK2), as a specific determinant of SG formation in obesity-associated PDAC. We show that SRPK2-mediated SG formation in obesity-associated PDAC is driven by hyperactivation of the IGF1/PI3K/mTOR/S6K1 pathway and that S6K1 inhibition selectively attenuates SGs and impairs obesity-associated PDAC development.Significance:: We show that stress adaptation via the phase-separation organelles SGs mediates PDAC development. Moreover, preexisting stress conditions such as obesity are a driving force behind tumor SG dependence, and enhanced SG levels are key determinants and a chemopreventive target for obesity-associated PDAC.
