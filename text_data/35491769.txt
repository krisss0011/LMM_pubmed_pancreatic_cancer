Though pancreatic cancer is uncommon, with an age-adjusted annual incidence of 12.9 cases per 100,000 person-years, it is considered a refractory cancer due to the mortality of 11.0 per 100,000 person-years. To efficiently identify patients with potentially surgically-curable pancreatic cancer, high-risk individuals (HRIs) for pancreatic cancer should be identified by easily and minimally invasive methods from the general population. We have identified unique processing patterns in the C-terminal amino acids of apolipoprotein A2 homodimer in the blood of patients with pancreatic cancer and in HRIs, and we called them apoA2-isoforms (apoA2-i). We then established an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure circulating apoA2-i in the blood stream. The diagnostic accuracy of apoA2-i to distinguish pancreatic cancer HRIs was verified by several retrospective studies, blind testing with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Early Detection Research Network (EDRN), a prospective study with prediagnostic samples organized by the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study, and the prospective screening study of pancreatic cancer in Kobe.The apoA2-i blood test is a potential biomarker to identify HRIs and the curative stage of pancreatic cancer in the general population.
