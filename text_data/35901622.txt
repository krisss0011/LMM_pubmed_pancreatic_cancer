Objective:To describe time-trends in incidence, characteristics, treatments, and survival in pancreatic cancer patients in Denmark during 1980-2019.Design:A nationwide population-based cohort study of all Danish patients diagnosed with exocrine pancreatic cancer during the study period. Data was obtained from individual-level cross linkage between Danish healthcare registries. We present descriptive characteristics and survival estimates, which was obtained using the Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox proportional hazards regression models.Results:During the study period, 32,107 patients were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. In the most recent period, the age-standardized incidence rate was 17.7 per 100,000 person-years. Throughout the study period, between 18.4% and 27.5% of patients had no tumor staging performed, and approximately half of the patient were only offered best supportive care. The proportion of patients treated with surgery doubled during the study period, and the use of adjuvant and neoadjuvant oncological therapy increased substantially. Median survival after surgical resection also increased to 25.8 months in the most recent time period.Conclusion:Pancreatic cancer incidence is increasing in Denmark, and this increase is projected to continue. The proportion of patients offered curative-intent treatment increased, which translates into an increase in overall survival. All numbers are comparable to best international standards.
