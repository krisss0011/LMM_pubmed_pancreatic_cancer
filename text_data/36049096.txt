Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a very aggressive tumor with a low overall survival rate. The prognostic and the treatment of this disease are strongly interconnected and highly dependent on the resectability criteria of the tumor, surgical excision being the golden standard. For local advance disease or for unresectable tumors, with or without metastasis we can take into consideration as adjuvant therapy, together with chemotherapy, the radiofrequency ablation or stereotactic ablation radiotherapy of the solid tumor mass. This article is a narrative review that aims to describe these two interventional techniques: radiofrequency ablation and stereotactic ablation radiotherapy. We will discuss the techniques themselves, benefits that they bring and also, about the possible complications that can appear when using them in the management of pancreatic cancer.
