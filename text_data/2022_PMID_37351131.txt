BACKGROUND: A solitary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) without macrovascular 
invasion and distant metastasis, regardless of tumor size, is currently 
classified as early-stage disease by the latest Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer 
(BCLC) staging system. While the preferred treatment is surgical resection, the 
association of tumor morphology with long-term survival outcomes after liver 
resection for a solitary huge HCC of â‰¥10 cm has not been defined.
METHODS: Patients who underwent curative liver resection for a solitary huge HCC 
were identified from a multicenter database. Preoperative imaging findings were 
used to define spherical- or ellipsoidal-shaped lesions with smooth edges as 
balloon-shaped HCCs (BS-HCCs); out-of-shape lesions or lesions of any shape with 
matt edges were defined as non-balloon-shaped HCCs (NBS-HCCs). The two groups of 
patients with BS-HCCs and NBS-HCCs were matched in a 1:1 ratio using propensity 
score matching (PSM). Clinicopathologic characteristics, long-term overall 
survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were assessed.
RESULTS: Among patients with a solitary huge HCC, 74 pairs of patients with 
BS-HCC and NBS-HCC were matched. Tumor pathological features including 
proportions of microvascular invasion, satellite nodules, and incomplete tumor 
encapsulation in the BS-HCC group were lower than the NBS-HCC group. At a median 
follow-up of 50.7 months, median OS and RFS of all patients with a solitary huge 
HCC after PSM were 27.8 and 10.1 months, respectively. The BS-HCC group had 
better median OS and RFS than the NBS-HCC group (31.9 vs. 21.0 months, P=0.01; 
and 19.7 vs. 6.4 months, P=0.015). Multivariate analyses identified BS-HCC as 
independently associated with better OS (HR =0.592, P=0.009) and RFS (HR =0.633, 
P=0.013).
CONCLUSIONS: For a solitary huge HCC, preoperative imaging on tumor morphology 
was associated with prognosis following resection. In particular, patients with 
BS-HCCs had better long-term survival following liver resection versus patients 
with large NBS-HCCs.
