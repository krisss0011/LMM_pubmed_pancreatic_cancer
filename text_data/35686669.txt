Background:Antihypertensive medications may have some impacts on cancer. The influence of antihypertensive medications, including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and diuretics, on patients with pancreatic cancer (PC) remains controversial. This meta-analysis was conducted to investigate whether antihypertensive medications had a negative effect on the prognosis of patients with PC.Methods:The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library databases were searched up to 30 November 2021. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to evaluate the quality of each study. This meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021279169) and was carried out by using RevMan 5.3.Results:Twelve studies with 120,549 patients were included in this study. ACEIs/ARBs [HR = 0.89, 95% CI (0.70-1.14)], CCB (HR = 0.69, 95% CI (0.47-0.99)], beta-blockers [HR = 0.95, 95% CI (0.84-1.07)] and diuretics [HR = 1.08, 95% CI (0.91-1.29)] use had no effects on overall survival among patients with PC (all P â‰¥ 0.05).Conclusion:Antihypertensive medication will not have a negative effect on overall survival in patients with PC. PC patients with hypertension should continue to use antihypertensive medications to reduce the morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular events.
