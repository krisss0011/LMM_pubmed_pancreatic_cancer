Background:The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of induction chemotherapy (ICT), GOFL (gemcitabine, oxaliplatin plus fluorouracil (5-FU)/leucovorin) versus modified FOLFIRINOX (irinotecan, oxaliplatin plus 5-FU/leucovorin), followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma (LAPC).Methods:Chemo-naive patients with measurable LAPC were eligible and randomly assigned to receive biweekly ICT with either mFOLFIRINOX or GOFL for 3 months. Patients without systemic progression would have 5-FU- or gemcitabine-based CCRT (5040 cGy/28 fractions) and were then subjected to surgery or continuation of chemotherapy until treatment failure. The primary endpoint was 9-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate.Results:Between July 2013 and January 2019, 55 patients were enrolled. After ICT, 21 (77.8%) of 27 patients who received mFOLFIRINOX and 17 (60.7%) of 28 patients who received GOFL completed CCRT. Of them, one and five had per-protocol R0/R1 resection. On intent-to-treat analysis, the 9-month PFS rate, median PFS and overall survival in mFOLFIRINOX and GOFL arms were 30.5% versus 35.9%, 6.6 (95% confidence interval: 5.9-12.5) versus 7.6 months (3.9-12.3) and 19.6 (13.4-22.9) versus 17.9 months (13.4-23.9), respectively. Grade 3-4 neutropenia and diarrhoea during induction mFOLFIRINOX and GOFL were 37.0% versus 21.4% and 14.8% versus 3.6%, respectively.Conclusion:Induction GOFL and mFOLFIRINOX followed by CCRT provided similar clinical outcomes in LAPC patients.Gov identifier:NCT01867892.
