Objectives Neoadjuvant therapy followed by radical resection improves the borderline-resectable pancreatic cancer (BRPC) prognosis; however, the optimal therapeutic regimen remains unclear. Gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel (GnP) showed a high anti-tumor effect in primary lesions in a prospective study for metastatic disease. However, evidence concerning its feasibility is still lacking in patients with BRPC. We therefore evaluated the tolerability of neoadjuvant GnP (NAC-GnP) for BRPC. Methods This single-center prospective study evaluated 10 patients with BRPC who were treated with two cycles of NAC-GnP. The primary endpoint was feasibility for NAC-GnP. Treatment feasibility was defined as a successful outcome in at least eight patients. Results Ten patients who had BRPC in contact with the celiac artery (n=5), superior mesenteric artery (n=3), or hepatic artery (n=2) were enrolled. The median age was 75 (range, 40-82) years old. Grade 3 anorexia and grade 2 pneumonia occurred in one patient each, so treatment was feasible in eight patients. The median primary tumor reduction and response rates were 33% (range, 0-68%) and 60%, respectively. Six of eight patients who had abnormal CA19-9 levels at the time of enrolment showed a decrease in CA19-9 levels, with a median decrease of 72%. Five patients underwent radical resection, including R0 resection in four. Postoperative grade IIIa Clavien-Dindo complications occurred in one patient (upper gastrointestinal bleeding and pancreatic fistula). Conclusion Two-cycle NAC-GnP is a feasible treatment for patients with BRPC. Further studies on NAC-GnP in patients with BRPC are warranted.
