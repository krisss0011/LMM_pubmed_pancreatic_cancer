Coronavirus is one of the RNA viruses with the largest genome; It is a group of viruses known to infect humans very little until the end of the 20th century, generally causing infection in animals (bird, cat, pig, mouse, horse, bat). It is the causative agent of 15-30% of seasonal lower and upper respiratory tract infections, and may rarely cause gastrointestinal and nervous system infections. We have obtained results for the collagenase and elastase enzymes were at the micromolar level. We obtained IC50results for the collagenase enzyme for 6-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin 257.22 ± 34.07 µM and for 2,5-dihydroxyacetophenone 74.46 ± 8.61 µM. 6-Hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin and 2,5-dihydroxyacetophenone were considered good inhibitors for elastase enzyme. Additionally, these compounds significantly decreased human pancreatic cancer cell viability from low doses. In addition, 100 µM dose of all compounds caused significant reductions in human pancreatic cancer cell viability. IC50results (IC50: 10-50 µM) were better than control. In the otherwords, the docking results suggest that both compounds tend to have lower efficacy on the main protease targets of SARS-CoV-2 than standard compounds, (NL-1 and NL-2). The reason for this is that the standard compounds interact strongly and more frequently with the target proteins, and the surface areas they cover on the active surface are much larger than the small ligand molecules studied.
