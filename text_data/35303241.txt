Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest neoplasms, with a dismal 5-year survival rate of only 10%. The ability of pancreatic cancer cells to evade the immune system hinders an anti-tumor response and contributes to the poor survival rate. Downregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I cell-surface expression can aid in immune evasion by preventing endogenous tumor antigens from being presented to cytotoxic T cells. Earlier studies suggested that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling can decrease MHC class I expression on certain cancer cell types. However, even though erlotinib (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets EGFR) is an approved drug for advanced pancreatic cancer treatment, the impact of EGFR inhibition or stimulation on pancreatic cancer cell MHC class I surface expression has not previously been analyzed. In this current study, we discovered that EGFR affects MHC class I mRNA and protein expression by human pancreatic cancer cell lines. We demonstrated that cell-surface MHC class I expression is downregulated upon EGFR activation, and the MHC class I level at the surface is elevated following EGFR inhibition. Furthermore, we found that EGFR associates with MHC class I molecules. By defining a role in pancreatic cancer cells for activated EGFR in reducing MHC class I expression and by revealing that EGFR inhibitors can boost MHC class I expression, our work supports further investigation of combined usage of EGFR inhibitors with immunotherapies against pancreatic cancer.
