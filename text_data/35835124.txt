A 79-year-old man with rising prostate-specific antigen of 3.2 ng/mL and diagnosis of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer received abiraterone and prednisone for treatment regarding prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-avid bone lesions on PET/CT. Four months later, a follow-up 18 F-DCFPyL PET/CT demonstrated new and increased multifocal PSMA-avid osseous and liver lesions, whereas prostate-specific antigen was stabled at 3.1 ng/mL. Biopsy of liver lesion showed metastasis from a primary pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma. Retrospectively, PSMA-avid pancreatic body lesion was identified on both PSMA PET/CT scans. This case illustrated that any above background PSMA uptake in the pancreas warrants suspicion for malignancy.
