Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is an inherently immune cell deprived tumor, characterized by desmoplastic stroma and suppressive immune cells. Here we systematically dissect PDA intrinsic mechanisms of immune evasion by in vitro and in vivo CRISPR screening, and identify Vps4b and Rnf31 as essential factors required for escaping CD8+T cell killing. For Vps4b we find that inactivation impairs autophagy, resulting in increased accumulation of CD8+T cell-derived granzyme B and subsequent tumor cell lysis. For Rnf31 we demonstrate that it protects tumor cells from TNF-mediated caspase 8 cleavage and subsequent apoptosis induction, a mechanism that is conserved in human PDA organoids. Orthotopic transplantation of Vps4b- or Rnf31 deficient pancreatic tumors into immune competent mice, moreover, reveals increased CD8+T cell infiltration and effector function, and markedly reduced tumor growth. Our work uncovers vulnerabilities in PDA that might be exploited to render these tumors more susceptible to the immune system.
