Introduction:Cancer-associated-cachexia represents a systemic syndrome of unintended weight-loss (WL) and systemic inflammation, affecting >80% patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PA). We aimed to evaluate the association of weight change (WC) with survival of patients treated with chemotherapy (ChT) for PA and the influence of disease staging. We also studied the prognostic and predictive value of inflammation-based scores.Methods:Observational, retrospective cohort study. Individuals were divided into two cohorts, according to WC (WL â‰¥5% vs. non-WL <5%) after ChT. Main endpoints were weight change and survival time. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata software.Results:Sixty-five patients were included (median age 69; 48% female), 60% with advanced disease. At 3 months after ChT start, 54% experienced WL. Advanced disease independently predicted WL (OR 2.10; 95% CI, 1.11-19.6;p= 0.041). With median follow-up of 14.8 mo, median survival time of patients with WL was 18.5 mo, vs. 33.2 vs. for non-WL (HR 2.28; 95% CI, 1.15-4.52;p= 0.019). In patients with early-stage disease, WL was associated with decreased survival time (21.9 vs. 67.6 mo; HR 23.68; 95% CI 2.39-234.75;p= 0.007), while the association of WL on survival time in advanced disease was not significant (HR 0.74; 95% CI, 0.34-1.60;p= 0.449). The multivariate survival model showed that WL (HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03-1.20,p= 0.005) and cachexia (HR 3.76, 95% CI 1.07-13-18),p= 0.041) were associated with survival time, as well as location in body or tail (HR 3.05; 95% CI, 1.75-5.31;p< 0.001) and high Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) at 3 months (HR 6.20; 95% CI, 2.59-14.87;p< 0.001).Conclusion:WL was an independent prognostic factor for survival. Particularly in early stage disease, interventions targeting this modifiable factor may translate into better outcomes for PA patients. NLR may be a surrogate marker of systemic inflammatory status in this setting.
