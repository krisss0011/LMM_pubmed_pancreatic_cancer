Background:Based on the Japan Adjuvant Study Group of Pancreatic Cancer 01 study, the standard duration of adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 (an oral 5-fluorouracil prodrug consisting of tegafur, gimeracil, and oteracil) in patients with resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) was considered to be 6 months, but the impact of increasing its duration on postoperative survival was unknown. Here, the authors investigated this question by reviewing real-world data from a large cohort of patients with PDAC.Methods:In total, 3949 patients who underwent surgery for PDAC during the study period followed by S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy in board-certified institutions were included. Based on the duration of S-1 chemotherapy, two subgroups were defined: a standard-duration group that included patients who were treated for 180 ± 30 days and a longer duration group that included patients who received treatment for >210 days.Results:The median duration of S-1 chemotherapy was 167 days, with a mean ± standard deviation of 200 ± 193 days. After excluding patients who had a recurrence within 210 days after the initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy, postoperative recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in the standard-duration group (n = 1473) and the longer duration group (n = 975) were compared. RFS and OS did not differ significantly between the standard-duration and longer duration groups (5-year RFS: 37.8% vs. 36.2% respectively; p = .6186; 5-year OS: 52.8% vs. 53.4%, respectively; p = .5850). The insignificant difference was verified by multivariate analysis and propensity-score matching analysis.Conclusions:The current findings suggest that extending S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy beyond 6 months has no significant additional effect on survival in patients with PDAC. This could be useful in determining whether to extend S-1 chemotherapy in patients who have completed the standard 6-month treatment.
