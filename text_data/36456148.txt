Background/aim:We aimed to explore the role of intracellular C3 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).Materials and methods:We evaluated C3 expression in PDAC using a gene expression database and tissue microarray. To clarify the role of C3 expression in PDAC, we conducted knockdown experiments using C3 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in BxPC-3 cells. Differences in protein expression and cell behaviours were analysed.Results:C3 was highly expressed in PDAC and correlated with cancer metastasis. In vitro experiments using BxPX-3 cells showed that C3 and its active form, C3a, were expressed in tumour cells. C3 knockdown reduced cell migration and invasion by inhibiting Akt/Smad pathway activation. TNF-Î±, not IL-6, enhanced C3 expression in this PDAC cell line.Conclusion:Intracellular C3 may regulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition in pancreatic cancer.
