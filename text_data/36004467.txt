Pancreatic cancer has a low response rate to chemotherapy due to the low drug transferability caused by the low blood flow around the tumor. In the present study, focusing on nitric oxide (NO) for its vasodilatory and antitumor effects, a novel NO donor, a nitrated form of phenylbutyrate (NPB) was synthesized and the antitumor effect on human pancreatic cancer cells (AsPC1 and BxPC3) and xenografts was examined. Using Annexin V, NPB was confirmed to induce cell death against AsPC1 and BxPC3 in a time‑ and concentration‑dependent manner. In NPB‑exposed cells, DAF‑FM DA (a probe to detect intracellular NO) derived fluorescence was observed. Release of nitrite and nitrate from NPB in aqueous solution was very gradual until even 72 h after dissolution. Phenylbutyrate (PB) and hydroxy PB in which the nitro group of NPB was replaced with a hydroxyl group did not have the cell death‑inducing effect as observed in NPB. These results suggest that the effect of NPB was dependent on NO release form NPB. Apoptosis inhibitor, Z‑VAD FMK, had no effect on the cell death‑inducing effect of NPB, and NPB did not show significant activation of caspase‑3/7. In addition, NPB significantly decreased cellular ATP levels, suggesting that necrosis is involved in the effect of NPB. NPB also accumulated cells specifically at the S phase of the cell cycle. A single dose of NPB (10 mg/kg) into mice with established BxPC3 xenografts significantly suppressed tumor growth for at least 7 weeks without apparent toxicity. The findings of the present study indicate that NPB has potential as a novel therapeutic agent for NO‑based therapy of pancreatic cancer.
