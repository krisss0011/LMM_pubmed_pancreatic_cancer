Background:Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) is a malignant tumor responsible for a heavy disease burden. Previously, only one pan-cancer study of Transmembrane channel-like protein 5 (TMC5) showed that TMC5 was highly expressed in PAAD, but the results lacked comprehensive verification, and the mechanism of TMC5 in PAAD was still unclear.Methods:For exploring the expression and clinical value of TMC5 in PAAD better, we adopted a comprehensive evaluation method, using internal immunohistochemistry (IHC) data combined with microarray and RNA-sequencing data collected from public databases. The single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data were exploited to explore the TMC5 expression in cell populations and intercellular communication. The potential mechanism of TMC5 in PAAD was analyzed from the aspects of immune infiltration, transcriptional regulation, function and pathway enrichment.Results:Our IHC data includes 148 PAAD samples and 19 non-PAAD samples, along with the available microarray and RNA-sequencing data (1166 PAAD samples, 704 non-PAAD samples). The comprehensive evaluation results showed that TMC5 was evidently up-regulated in PAAD (SMD = 1.17). Further analysis showed that TMC5 was over-expressed in cancerous epithelial cells. Furthermore, TMC5 was up-regulated in more advanced tumor T and N stages. Interestingly, we found that STAT3 as an immune marker of Th17 cells was not only positively correlated with TMC5 and up-regulated in PAAD tissues, but also the major predicted TMC5 transcription regulator. Moreover, STAT3 was involved in cancer pathway of PAAD.Conclusion:Up-regulated TMC5 indicates advanced tumor stage in PAAD patients, and its role in promoting PAAD development may be regulated by STAT3.
