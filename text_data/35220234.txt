Background/aim:Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) is the most common precursor lesion to pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Yet no criteria to quantify patients at risk for progression to PDAC with PanIN exist. Platelet to lymphocyte ratio is an inflammatory marker that has been associated with overall survival in patients with invasive malignancies including pancreatic cancer. Preoperative sarcopenia has been linked to more aggressive diseases in pancreatic neoplasms. We aimed to assess a relation between PLR and sarcopenia as predictors for tumor progression in patients undergoing pancreatic resection for IPMN.Patients and methods:We retrospectively reviewed 102 patients (46 females, 56 males) who underwent pancreatic resection for PanIn. PLR was calculated and quantified using a cutoff of 110, sarcopenia was quantified using the skeletal muscle index (SMI) on preoperative abdominal imaging. Both were co-evaluated with additional demographic, clinical, pathological, and imaging data for possible correlation with PanIN associated PDAC.Results:PLR was significantly elevated in patients with PanIN - associated PDAC (p=0.006). In the multivariate analysis, invasive carcinomas were significantly more prevalent in patients with PLR above 110 (OR=4.06, 95%CI=3.91-4.12, p=0.04). Patients with elevated PLR had a two-times higher risk to die in the postoperative period (HR=2.26, 95%CI=1.04-2.21, p=0.001). Patients with elevated PLR, preoperative jaundice and sarcopenia were the most likely to have PanIN-associated PDAC (OR=3.48, 95%CI=2.98-8.41, p=0.02).Conclusion:PLR is an independent predictive marker for the presence of PanIN associated invasive carcinoma.
