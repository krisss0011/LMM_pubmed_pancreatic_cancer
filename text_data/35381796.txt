Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the seventh largest cause of death from cancer with a death rate of 3.8%. The 5-year survival rate is only 5%. We report A case 28 year old male presented with a 3 week history of pain in upper part of abdomen and dyspepsia of similar duration. After 2 cycles of palliative chemotherapy he presented with diminution of vision in right eye and watering of eye. USG showed retinal detachment with vitreous hemorrhage in the right eye and left eye was normal. On fundoscopy choroidal metastasis was detected as an accidental finding in the right eye. Though Ca Pancreas usually presents in as locally advanced or metastatic disease choroidal metastasis are extremely rare. Despite disappearance of ocular metastasis he had a progressive disease and died of intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Reports of pancreatic cancer with metastasis to the choroid and optic nerve have been rare. There were few reports that demonstrated the significance of a choroidal lesion as the initial clinical sign of pancreatic cancer. This aggressive behavior of the lesion may be an important feature to determine the origin of the tumor. Cancer of the tail of the pancreas is often not detected in the early stages before metastasizing.
