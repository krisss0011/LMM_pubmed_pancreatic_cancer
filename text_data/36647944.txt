Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly malignant tumor with an increasing incidence rate in recent years. Because pancreatic cancer has an insidious onset, unknown pathophysiology, and poor prognosis, the overall survival rate of pancreatic cancer patients has not improved considerably even with extensive treatment methods such as surgery, radiation, biotherapy, and targeted therapy. Therefore, finding and developing more effective and safe treatments for pancreatic cancer is critical. Cellular immunotherapy has achieved considerable advances in the field of oncology in recent years. Technology is continuously advancing, with new breakthroughs virtually every month, and pancreatic cancer eradication is expected to improve considerably. This article examines the advance of chimeric antigen receptor NK cell immunotherapy (CAR-NK) cell immunotherapy for pancreatic cancer research, as well as research ideas for pancreatic cancer treatment.
