Background:A total of 148 surgeries were performed in our center on patients with pancreatic cancer in 2020. In 2019, 263 such procedures were performed (77.7% more) in this facility.Objectives:To analyze the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on pancreatic cancer surgery type, number and outcome in our center.Material and methods:Retrospective data analysis of medical documentation in a hospital database from January 2019 till December 2020.Results:In 2020, we observed an increase of tumors localized in the tail of the pancreas (P) - 29 cases (19.9%) in 2020 compared to 26 cases (9.9%) in 2019 (p = 0.005). In 2020, our patients presented with much greater advancement of the disease illustrated by the increased tumor size (median 3.5 cm in 2020 compared to 3.0 cm in 2019), although it did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.073). In 2020, we performed more palliative procedures, e.g., bypassing anastomoses (17 (11.6%) in 2020 compared to 8 (3%) in 2019 (p < 0.001)), more open biopsies of P (21 (14.4%) in 2020 compared to 21 (7.9%) in 2019 (p = 0.041)), and more percutaneous biopsies of P (7 (4.8%) in 2020 and 0 in 2019 (p = 0.001)). We observed a significant decrease in the number of Whipple procedures (53 (36.3%) in 2020 and 125 (47.5%) in 2019 (p = 0.037)). The most common histopathological finding was adenocarcinoma of the P, accounting for 50% in 2020 and almost 52% of all tumor cases in 2019. In a group of 148 patients operated on due to a P tumor during the COVID-19 pandemic, only 6 patients died, which resulted in a mortality rate of 4.1% compared to 13.4% mortality rate in 2019 (34 deaths/263 patients; p = 0.005). We observed less leakage of gastrointestinal anastomosis (0/148 in 2020 and 10/263 in 2019 (p = 0.038)).Conclusions:Particular attention should be paid to patients with an aggressive type of cancer who have completed neoadjuvant therapy, as they are unable to undergo other therapeutic options. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive cancer patients should be postponed until recovery. Relatively few postoperative complications and low all-cause mortality are the result of a more careful selection of oncological patients before the admission to the surgical ward, as well as a ompliance with the principles of planning the procedure and organization of the operating theater during the COVID-19 pandemic.
