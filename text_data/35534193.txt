The liver is the predominant metastatic site for pancreatic cancer. However, the factors that determine the liver metastasis and the specific molecular mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, we used human pancreatic cancer cell line Hs766T to establish Hs766T-L3, a subline of Hs766T with stable liver metastatic ability. We performed RNA sequencing of Hs766T-L3 and its parental cell line Hs766T, and revealed huge differences in gene expression patterns and pathway activation between these two cell lines. We correlated the difference in pathway activation with the expression of the four core transcriptional factors including STAT1, NR2F2, GATA2, and SMAD4. Using the TCGA database, we examined the relative expression of these transcription factors (TFs) in pan-cancer and their relationship with the prognosis of the pancreatic cancer. Among these TFs, we considered GATA2 is closely involved in tumor metastasis and may serve as a potential metastatic driver. Furtherin vitroandin vivoexperiments confirmed that GATA2-mediated transcriptional activation of Notch3 promotes the liver metastasis of Hs766T-L3, and knockdown of either GATA2 or Notch3 reduces the metastatic ability of Hs766T-L3. Therefore, we claim that GATA2 may serve as a metastatic driver of pancreatic cancer and a potential therapeutic target to treat liver metastasis of pancreatic cancer.
