Background:Preoperative prediction of pancreatic cystic neoplasm (PCN) differentiation has significant value for the implementation of personalized diagnosis and treatment plans. This study aimed to build radiomics deep learning (DL) models using computed tomography (CT) data for the preoperative differential diagnosis of common cystic tumors of the pancreas.Methods:Clinical and CT data of 193 patients with PCN were collected for this study. Among these patients, 99 were pathologically diagnosed with pancreatic serous cystadenoma (SCA), 55 were diagnosed with mucinous cystadenoma (MCA) and 39 were diagnosed with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). The regions of interest (ROIs) were obtained based on manual image segmentation of CT slices. The radiomics and radiomics-DL models were constructed using support vector machines (SVMs). Moreover, based on the fusion of clinical and radiological features, the best combined feature set was obtained according to the Akaike information criterion (AIC) analysis. Then the fused model was constructed using logistic regression.Results:For the SCA differential diagnosis, the fused model performed the best and obtained an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.916. It had a best feature set including position, polycystic features (â‰¥6), cystic wall calcification, pancreatic duct dilatation and radiomics-DL score. For the MCA and IPMN differential diagnosis, the fused model with AUC of 0.973 had a best feature set including age, communication with the pancreatic duct and radiomics score.Conclusions:The radiomics, radiomics-DL and fused models based on CT images have a favorable differential diagnostic performance for SCA, MCA and IPMN. These findings may be beneficial for the exploration of individualized management strategies.
