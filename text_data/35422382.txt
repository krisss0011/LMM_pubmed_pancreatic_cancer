Background:Early-onset pancreatic cancer (â‰¤50 years, EOPC) is uncommon. This study aims to characterize the clinical and survival characteristics of EOPC in comparison to late-onset pancreatic cancer (>50 years, LOPC).Methods:We retrospectively investigated consecutive PC patients treated at our institution between 2010 and 2019. We analyzed and compared clinicopathological characteristics, treatments, and outcomes of EOPC and LOPC.Results:Of 1646 PC patients identified (768 resectable/borderline resectable; 248 locally advanced; 630 metastatic), 127 (8%) had EOPC. Current smoking and heavy drinking were associated with EOPC. EOPC presented at a more advanced stage and had higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios than LOPC. Survival outcomes were similar between the two groups, both in the entire cohort and in each resectability group. In patients undergoing resection, EOPC tended to have a higher N stage (p = 0.099) and had a higher pathological stage (stage IV, 20% vs. 7%, p = 0.005) and a lower rate of macroscopically curative resection (80% vs. 93%, p = 0.006). Liver recurrence was more commonly observed in EOPC (42% vs. 23%, p = 0.015). In the metastatic cohort, combination chemotherapy regimens were more frequently administered in EOPC as first-line treatment (79% vs. 64%, p = 0.028). Both median PFS (4.4 vs. 5.3 months, p = 0.647) and OS (11.5 vs. 9.5 months, p = 0.183) were not significantly different between the two groups.Conclusions:EOPC presented with a more aggressive tumor biology. Survival outcomes were similar to LOPC due to more intensive treatment.
