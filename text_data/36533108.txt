Background:Pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma (PACC) is a rare tumor. Up to 45% of PACCs have alterations in the DNA damage repair pathway and 23% harbor rearrangements in theBRAForRAF1genes. We present a PACC case with a germlineBRCA2likely pathogenic variant (LPV) to highlight the impact of genomic testing on treatment decisions and patient outcomes. In our larger case series, we provide clinic-based information on additional 10 PACC patients treated in our center.Case summary:A 70-year-old male was diagnosed with advanced PACC. At presentation, he was cachectic with severe arthralgia despite prednisolone and a skin rash that was later confirmed to be panniculitis. He was treated with modified FOLFIRINOX (mFFX) with the knowledge of the germlineBRCA2LPV. Following 11 cycles of mFFX, a computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated significant tumor response in the pancreatic primary and hepatic metastases, totaling 70% from baseline as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Resolution of the skin panniculitis was also noted. We identified two additional PACCs with druggable targets in our case series. Our data contribute to practical evidence for the value of germline and somatic profiling in the management of rare diseases like PACC.Conclusion:This patient and others in our larger case series highlight the importance of genomic testing in PACC with potential utility in personalized treatment.
