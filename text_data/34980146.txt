Pancreatic cancer is a highly malignant tumor and, is extremely difficult to diagnose and treat. Metastasis is one of the critical steps in the development of cancer and uses cell to cell communication to mediate changes in the microenvironment. Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs)-carry proteins, nucleic acids and other bioactive substances, and are important medium for communication between cells. There are two primary steps in sVEs-mediated metastasis: communication between pancreatic cancer cells and their surrounding microenvironment; and the communication between primary tumor cells and distant organ cells in distant organs that promotes angiogenesis, reshaping extracellular matrix, forming immunosuppressive environment and other ways to form appropriate pre-metastasis niche. Here, we explore the mechanism of localization and metastasis of pancreatic cancer and use sEVs as early biomarkers for the detection and treatment of pancreatic cancer. Video Abstract.
