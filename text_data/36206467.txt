Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal cancer types, estimated to become the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States in 2030. The use of 3-dimensional culture systems has greatly expanded over the past few years, providing a valuable tool for the study of pancreatic cancer. In this review, we highlight some of the preclinical in vitro and in vivo models used in pancreatic cancer research, each with its own advantages and disadvantages, and focus on one of the recently used 3-dimensional culture models: organoids. Organoids are multicellular units derived from tissue samples and embedded within extracellular matrix gels after mechanical and enzymatic digestion. We define organoids, differentiate them from other 3-dimensional culture systems such as spheroids, and describe some applications of this model that have recently advanced our understanding of pancreatic cancer and its tumor microenvironment. Organoids have provided valuable insights into pancreatic cancer progression, heterogeneity, and invasion, and they have enabled the creation of biobanks, providing a platform for drug screening. In addition, we discuss some of the future directions and challenges in this model when addressing research questions.
