Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most cancers. Its 5-year survival rate is very low. The recent induction of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and improvements in chemotherapy for patients with pancreatic cancer have resulted in improved survival outcomes. However, the prognosis of pancreatic cancer is still poor. To dramatically improve the prognosis, we need to develop more tools for early diagnosis, treatment selection, disease monitoring, and response rate evaluation. Recently, liquid biopsy (circulating free DNA, circulating tumor DNA, circulating tumor cells, exosomes, and microRNAs) has caught the attention of many researchers as a new biomarker that is minimally invasive, confers low-risk, and displays an overall state of the tumor. Thus, liquid biopsy does not employ the traditional difficulties of obtaining tumor samples from patients with advanced PDAC to investigate their molecular biological status. In addition, it allows for long-term monitoring of the molecular profile of tumor progression. These could help in identifying tumor-specific alterations that use the target structure for tailor-made therapy. Through this review, we highlighted the latest discoveries and advances in liquid biopsy technology in pancreatic cancer research and showed how it can be applied in clinical practice.
