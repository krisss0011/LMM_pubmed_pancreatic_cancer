Background & aims:Oncogenic Kirsten Rat Sarcoma virus (KRAS) is the hallmark mutation of human pancreatic cancer and a driver of tumorigenesis in genetically engineered mouse models of the disease. Although the tumor cell-intrinsic effects of oncogenic Kras expression have been widely studied, its role in regulating the extensive pancreatic tumor microenvironment is less understood.Methods:Using a genetically engineered mouse model of inducible and reversible oncogenic Kras expression and a combination of approaches that include mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing we studied the effect of oncogenic KRAS in the tumor microenvironment.Results:We have discovered that non-cell autonomous (ie, extrinsic) oncogenic KRAS signaling reprograms pancreatic fibroblasts, activating an inflammatory gene expression program. As a result, fibroblasts become a hub of extracellular signaling, and the main source of cytokines mediating the polarization of protumorigenic macrophages while also preventing tissue repair.Conclusions:Our study provides fundamental knowledge on the mechanisms underlying the formation of the fibroinflammatory stroma in pancreatic cancer and highlights stromal pathways with the potential to be exploited therapeutically.
