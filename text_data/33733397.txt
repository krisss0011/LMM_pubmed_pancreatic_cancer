Background:Determining how many female patients who underwent breast imaging meet the eligibility criteria for genetic testing for familial pancreatic cancer (FPC).Methods:A total of 42,904 patients seen at the Newton-Wellesley Hospital between 2007 and 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. The first four categories were based on pancreatic cancer-associated syndromes: (1) hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC), (2) Lynch syndrome (LS), (3) familial atypical multiple mole melanoma (FAMMM), and (4) family history of FPC (FH-FPC). PancPRO (5) and MelaPRO (6) categories were based on risk scores from Mendelian risk prediction tool.Results:Exactly 4445 of 42,904 patients were found to be in at least one of the six risk categories. About 5.7% of patients were classified as being at high risk for HBOC, 2.3% as being at high risk for LS, 0.1% as being at high risk for FAMMM, 0.1% as being at high risk for FH-FPC, 2.7% as being at high risk based on PancPRO, and 0.2% as being at high risk based on MelaPRO.Conclusion:About 10.4% of the female patients were classified as being at high risk for FPC. This finding emphasizes the importance of applying criteria to the general population, in order to ensure that individuals with high risk are identified early.
