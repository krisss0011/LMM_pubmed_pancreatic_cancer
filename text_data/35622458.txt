Background:The selective pressure imposed by chemotherapy creates a barrier to tumor eradication and an opportunity for metastasis and recurrence. As a newly discovered stemness marker of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the impact of CD9 on tumor progression and patient's prognosis remain controversial.Methods:A total of 179 and 211 PDAC patients who underwent surgical resection with or without neoadjuvant chemotherapy, respectively, were recruited for immunohistochemical analyses of CD9 expression in both tumor and stromal areas prior to statistical analyses to determine the prognostic impact and predictive accuracy of CD9.Results:The relationship between CD9 and prognostic indicators was not significant in the non-neoadjuvant group. Nevertheless, CD9 expression in both tumor (T-CD9) and stromal areas (S-CD9) was significantly correlated with the clinicopathological features in the neoadjuvant group. High levels of T-CD9 were significantly associated with worse OS (p = 0.005) and RFS (p = 0.007), while positive S-CD9 showed the opposite results (OS: p = 0.024; RFS: p = 0.008). Cox regression analyses identified CD9 in both areas as an independent prognostic factor. The T&S-CD9 risk-level system was used to stratify patients with different survival levels. The combination of T&S-CD9 risk level and TNM stage were accurate predictors of OS (C-index: 0.676; AIC: 512.51) and RFS (C-index: 0.680; AIC: 519.53). The calibration curve of the nomogram composed of the combined parameters showed excellent predictive consistency for 1-year RFS. These results were verified using a validation cohort.Conclusion:Neoadjuvant chemotherapy endows CD9 with a significant prognostic value that differs between tumor and stromal areas in patients with pancreatic cancer.
