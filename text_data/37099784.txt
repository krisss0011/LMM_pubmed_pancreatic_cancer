Objective:The aim of the study is to evaluate the influence of cachexia at the time of diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) on prognosis in patients undergoing surgical resection.Methods:Patients with data on preoperative body weight (BW) change followed by surgical resection during 2008-2017 were selected. Large BW loss was defined as weight loss >5% or >2% in individuals with body mass index less than 20 kg/m2 within 1 year preoperatively. Influence of large BW loss, ΔBW defined as preoperative BW change (%) per month, prognostic nutrition index, and indices of sarcopenia.Results:We evaluated 165 patients with PDAC. Preoperatively, 78 patients were categorized as having large BW loss. ΔBW was ≤ -1.34% per month (rapid) and > -1.34% per month (slow) in 95 and 70 patients, respectively. The median postoperative overall survival of rapid and slow ΔBW groups was 1.4 and 4.4 years, respectively (P < 0.001). In multivariate analyses rapid ΔBW (hazard ratio [HR], 3.88); intraoperative blood loss ≥430 mL (HR, 1.89); tumor size ≥2.9 cm (HR, 1.74); and R1/2 resection (HR, 1.77) were independent predictors of worse survival.Conclusions:Preoperative rapid BW loss ≥1.34% per month was an independent predictor of worse survival of patients with PDAC.
