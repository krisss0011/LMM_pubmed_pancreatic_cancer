Objectives:Pancreatic cancer is one of the malignant tumors in the digestive system all over the world. It has a very low survival rate. Although there is a great advancement in its therapy either through radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or other therapies, the overall survival is still less than 24 months. Another problem for pancreatic cancer is the resistance to its conventional chemotherapy (e.g., gemcitabine). From this point of view, there is an urgent need to find an effective drug treatment METHODS: The anticancer activity of the germinated fenugreek seed extract is examined in vitro and in vivo against BXPC-3 pancreatic cancer cell lines. Two groups of albino mice were injected with BXPC-3 cells: the first group remained non-treated and the second group was injected with IC50 of the fenugreek extract. The body weight and the survival rate were observed in the two groups and histological examination of the pancreatic tissue was observed RESULTS: Germinated fenugreek seed extract can be efficiently maximized the survival rate in pancreatic cancer mice and protect the pancreatic tissue from lesions related to cancer.Conclusion:Germinated fenugreek seed extract can be used to fight pancreatic cancer.
