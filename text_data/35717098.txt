Molecular imaging with PET-computerized tomography (PET-CT) plays an important role in oncology. There is current and evolving evidence supporting the use of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and non-FDG tracers in assessment patients with hepatobiliary and pancreatic cancers in various clinical scenarios. In this chapter, we discuss the advantages and limitations of FDG and non-FDG PET-CT in the management of patients with hepatobiliary and pancreatic cancers.
