Delayed gastric emptying (DGE) is common in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). The effect of DGE on mortality is less clear. We sought to identify predictors of mortality in patients undergoing PD for pancreatic adenocarcinoma hypothesizing DGE to independently increase risk of 30-day mortality. The ACS-NSQIP targeted pancreatectomy database (2014-2017) was queried for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma undergoing PD. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed. Separate sensitivity analyses were performed adjusting for postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) grades A-C. Out of 8011 patients undergoing PD, 1246 had DGE (15.6%). About 8.5% of patients with DGE had no oral intake by postoperative day-14. The DGE group had a longer median operative duration (373 vs. 362 min, p = 0.019), and a longer hospital length of stay (16.5 vs. 8 days, p < 0.001). After adjusting for age, gender, comorbidities, preoperative chemotherapy, preoperative radiation, open versus laparoscopic approach, vascular resection, deep surgical space infection (DSSI), postoperative percutaneous drain placement, and development of a POPF, DGE was associated with an increased risk for 30-day mortality (OR 3.25, 2.16-4.88, p < 0.001). On sub-analysis, grades A and B POPF were not associated with risk of mortality while grade C POPF was associated with increased risk of mortality (OR 5.64, 2.24-14.17, p < 0.001). The rate of DGE in patients undergoing PD in this large database was over 15%. DGE is associated with greater than three times the increased associated risk of mortality, even when controlling for POPF, DSSI, and other known predictors of mortality.
