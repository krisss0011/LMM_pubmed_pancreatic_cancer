Due to their increased detection pancreatic cystic space-occupying lesions are becoming increasingly relevant in the clinical routine and represent a morphologically and biologically heterogeneous and thus clinically demanding as well as potentially (pre)malignant entity. As a result, recommendations for the diagnostics and treatment of pancreatic cystic tumors have now been incorporated into the current German S3 guidelines on pancreatic cancer. The diagnostics of pancreatic cystic space-occupying lesions are based on the following three elements: collection of relevant clinical information, performance of high-resolution imaging procedures and if diagnostic uncertainty persists, puncture diagnostics. Differentiated diagnostics are of essential importance as these represent the basis for an adequate treatment decision. Pancreatic cystic lesions with a relevant risk of malignant transformation, e.g., main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN), followed by mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCN), solid pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPN) and generally pancreatic cystic lesions with risk factors independent of the entity, should be resected, whereas a differentiated and individualized approach is necessary, especially for branch-duct IPMNs. The serous cystic neoplasms (SCN) have no malignant potential and do not require any treatment if they are asymptomatic. Important principles in surgery of pancreatic cancer, such as adequate surgical resection taking oncological standards into account and standardized appropriate histopathological processing of the specimens as well as intraoperative frozen section analysis also play an important role in pancreatic cystic space-occupying lesions. An annual follow-up seems to be meaningful, especially for IPMNs.
