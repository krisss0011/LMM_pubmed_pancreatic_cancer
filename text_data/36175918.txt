Background:Multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) and serum tumor markers are commonly used in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer (PC). In this article, we focused on the evaluation of the clinical value of MDCT combined with serum tumor markers CA199, CA242, and CEA in diagnosis, preoperative, and prognostic evaluation of PC.Methods:Eighty-five PC patients (PC group) and 39 patients with pancreatitis (control group) admitted to our hospital were selected for our present research study. MDCT, CA199, CA242, and CEA examination were examined in all patients, and their value in diagnosis, preoperative, and prognostic evaluation of PC was retrospectively analyzed.Results:There were 69 patients whose clinical staging results of MDCT were consistent with the postoperative pathological diagnosis. The coincidence rate was 70.00% in stage I, 62.96% in stage II, 72.72% in stage III, and 80.00% in stage IV, respectively, and the overall coincidence rate was 69.57%The levels of CA199, CA242, and CEA in PC group were remarkably higher than those in control group and were sharply correlated with clinical stage, differentiation degree, and distant metastasis. The sensitivity, accuracy, and negative predictive value of MDCT combined with serum CA199, CA242 and CEA in the diagnosis of PC were significantly improved compared with those of each single test. In PC group, the 2-year event-free survival rate of the group with high CA199, CA242, and CEA expression was remarkably lower than that of the low expression group.Conclusion:MDCT combined with CA199, CA242, and CEA notably improved the diagnostic efficiency of PC and had guiding significance for preoperative and prognostic evaluation of PC.
