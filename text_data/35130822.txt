Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most lethal malignancies. PC is characterized by a high expression of the glucose transporter GLUT-1 and of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A). The novel LDH-A inhibitor NHI-Glc-2 was designed for a better uptake via GLUT-1 and was shown to be cytotoxic against the PC cell line PANC-1. Using RP-HPLC we investigated its effect on adenine nucleotides and NADH/NAD+, while the Seahorse analyzer was used to determine its effect on glycolysis and mitochondrial function. A 24 hour exposure to 10 µM NHI-Glc-2 (around the IC50) decreased the ATP concentration by about 10%, but at 25 µM this decrease was 38%, while NAD+decreased by 26%, associated with a 35% decrease in the NADH/NAD+ratio. A 10 µM NHI-Glc-2 decreased extracellular acidification and oxygen consumption (about 75%), as well as the mitochondrial respiration parameters by 50%. In conclusion, LDH-A inhibition markedly affected the energy supply of PANC-1 cells. The respiration data indicated a dependency of the cells on glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/15257770.2022.2031215 .
