Thrombosis is the second leading cause of death in cancer patients. Patients with pancreatic cancer (PC) have a very high risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE). Even though primary ambulatory thromboprophylaxis (PATP) could decrease this risk, there are uncertain issues with regard to the choice and dose of anticoagulants, duration of anticoagulant therapy, and patient selection criteria. In addition, the current practice guidelines on PATP in PC patients are equivocal. This review critically appraises the evidence on the use of PATP in PC patients receiving chemotherapy.
