Objective:The aim of this study was to reappraise the optimal number of examined lymph nodes (ELNs) in pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).Summary background data:The well-established threshold of 15 ELNs in PD for PDAC is optimized for detecting 1 positive node (PLN) per the previous 7th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging manual. In the framework of the 8th edition, where at least 4 PLN are needed for an N2 diagnosis, this threshold may be inadequate for accurate staging.Methods:Patients who underwent upfront PD at 2 academic institutions between 2000 and 2016 were analyzed. The optimal ELN threshold was defined as the cut-point associated with a 95% probability of identifying at least 4 PLNs in N2 patients. The results were validated addressing the N-status distribution and stage migration.Results:Overall, 1218 patients were included. The median number of ELN was 26 (IQR 17-37). ELN was independently associated with N2-status (OR 1.27, P < 0.001). The estimated optimal threshold of ELN was 28. This cut-point enabled improved detection of N2 patients and stage III disease (58% vs 37%, P = 0.001). The median survival was 28.6 months. There was an improved survival in N0/N1 patients when ELN exceeded 28, suggesting a stage migration effect (47 vs 29 months, adjusted HR 0.649, P < 0.001). In N2 patients, this threshold was not associated with survival on multivariable analysis.Conclusion:Examining at least 28 LN in PD for PDAC ensures optimal staging through improved detection of N2/stage III disease. This may have relevant implications for benchmarking processes and quality implementation.
