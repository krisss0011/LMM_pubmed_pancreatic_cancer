Background:Extrapancreatic nerve plexus (PL) invasion of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an important factor for determining resectability and surgical method. We sought to clarify the characteristics of PDAC with PL invasion and clinical impact of the resection margin status on prognosis for PDAC with PL invasion.Methods:A total of 242 patients with pancreatic head cancer who underwent pancreatectomy were evaluated. Clinicopathological data and patient survival were analyzed.Results:Pathological PL invasion was observed in 68 patients (28.1%). Patients with PL invasion had significantly shorter disease-free survival (DFS) and showed trends toward worse overall survival (OS) than those without PL invasion. While multivariate analysis revealed that PL invasion was not an independent prognostic factor, PL invasion was associated with extensive venous invasion and a high percentage of lymph node metastases, both of which were independent factors affecting DFS and OS. Among patients with PL invasion, there was no significant difference in DFS and OS between the R0 and R1 resection groups.Conclusions:PL invasion is a common pathological feature of aggressive PDAC with high propensity for invasiveness and metastatic potential. The microscopic resection margin status may not affect the survival of pancreatic head cancer patients with PL invasion.
