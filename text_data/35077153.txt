In situoxygen generation is the most common strategy to boost reactive oxygen species (ROS) for enhancing the efficacy of phototherapy in cancer, including photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT). However, hyperoxidation or hyperthermia often triggers stress-defense pathways and promotes tumor cell survival, thus severely limiting the therapeutic efficacy. To overcome the tumor hypoxia and thermal resistance existing in phototherapy, we constructed a self-synergistic nanoplatform for tumors by incorporating brusatol, a nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) inhibitor, into the silica nanonetwork. It was then sequentially decorated with MnO2and the photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) and then coated with poly(ethylene glycol)-folate (PEG-FA)-functionalized polydopamine (PDA) (designated as brusatol/silica@MnO2/Ce6@PDA-PEG-FA). As an oxygen generator, MnO2can promote ROS production, which not only directly enhances Ce6-mediated PDT but also strengthens PDA-mediated PTT by attacking heat shock proteins (HSPs). Particularly, brusatol could efficiently inhibit the activation of Nrf2 defense pathway under hyperoxidation and hyperthermia and cause glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and ferritin heavy chain (FTH) inactivation, thereby inducing ferroptosis and ultimately enhancing the phototherapeutic effects. By exploiting these features, brusatol/silica@MnO2/Ce6@PDA-PEG-FA exhibited excellent antitumor efficacy with enhanced PDT and PTT both inin vitroandin vivostudies. Overall, our work highlights a promising strategy against hypoxia- and hyperthermia-associated resistance in phototherapyviasuppressing stress-defense system and inducing ferroptosis.
