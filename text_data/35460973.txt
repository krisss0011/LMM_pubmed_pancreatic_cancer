Background:Today, the pancreatic cancer prognosis is poor and genetic technology is developing to treat various types of cancers. Scientists are actively looking for a new technique to design a therapeutic strategy to treat pancreatic cancer. Several oncolytic viruses are known to be valuable tools for pancreatic cancer treatment. Recent Studies demonstrate their effectiveness and safety in various administration routes such as direct intratumoral, intracutaneous, intravascular, and other routes.Method:In this study, all studies conducted in the past 20 years have been reviewed. Reputable scientific databases including Irandoc, Scopus, Google Scholar and PubMed, are searched for the keywords of Pancreatic cancer, oncolytic, viruses and treatment and the latest information about them is obtained.Results:Engineering the oncolytic viruses' genome and insertion of intended transgenes including cytokines or shRNAs, has caused promising promotions in pancreatic cancer treatment. Some oncolytic viruses inhibit tumors directly and some through activation of immune responses.Conclusion:This approach showed some signs of success in efficiency like immune system activation in the tumor environment, effective virus targeting in the tumor cells by systemic administration, and enhanced patient survival in comparison with the control group. But of course, until now, using these oncolytic viruses alone has not been effective in elimination of tumors.
