Background:Patients factors in addition to radiological characteristics could predict the presence of pathologic venous invasion in patients undergoing pancreatectomy with venous resection.Methods:We tested the predictive value of 6 radiological classification methods for predicting pathologic venous invasion-the Nakao, Ishikawa, MD Anderson, Lu, Raptopoulos, and National Comprehensive Cancer Network methods-on a cohort of 198 pancreatectomies (160 pancreaticoduodenectomies and 38 total pancreatectomies) with venous resection for pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Radiological and clinical factors determining pathologic venous invasion were identified by multivariable logistic analysis.Results:Pathologic venous invasion was detected in 124 patients (63.2%). The multivariable logistic regression analysis identified Lu classification (odds ratio = 1.77, 95% confidence interval =1.34-2.35; P < .0001), elevated serum CA19-9 values (odds ratio = 1.97, 95% confidence interval = 1.00-3.90; P = .04), and preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy (odds ratio = 0.38, 95% confidence interval = 0.18-0.79; P = .009) as independent factors associated with pathologic venous invasion. Radiological tumor-vessel contact greater than 50% of the circumference or venous wall deformity was associated with a significantly higher rate of pathological venous invasion (80% vs 52%; P < .0001), deeper (media-intima) venous invasion (47% vs 25%; P < .0001), R1 resection (58% vs 41%; P = .03), higher transfusions (84% vs 66%; P = .005), and arterial resection rates (43% vs 27%; P < .0001). Tumor-vein circumference contact of >50% and/or venous wall deformity was still associated with significantly higher rates of pathologic venous invasion, regardless of whether neoadjuvant chemotherapy was used or not and CA19-9 normalized or not under preoperative treatment.Conclusion:Preoperative radiological detection of tumor-vein circumference contact >50% and/or venous wall deformity is associated with up to 80% of cases of pathological venous invasion. The combination of radiologic features with biological (CA19-9) and clinical (presence of preoperative chemotherapy) factors could better refine preoperatively the need for venous resection.
