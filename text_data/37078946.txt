Objectives:Network of long noncoding RNA-microRNA (miRNA)-mRNA is becoming increasingly pivotal roles in carcinogenesis mechanism. Herein, we aim to delineate the mechanistic understanding of dipeptidyl peptidase like 10-antisense RNA 1 (DPP10-AS1)/miRNA-324-3p/claudin 3 (CLDN3) axis in the malignancy of pancreatic cancer (PC).Methods:Microarray profiling and other bioinformatics methods were adopted to predict differentially expressed long noncoding RNA-miRNA-mRNA in PC, followed by verification of expression of DPP10-AS1, microRNA-324-3p (miR-324-3p), and CLDN3 in PC cells. The relationship among DPP10-AS1, miR-324-3p, and CLDN3 were further assessed. The PC cell invasion and migration were evaluated by scratch test and transwell assay. Tumor formation and lymph node metastasis were assessed in nude mice.Results:Highly expressed DPP10-AS1 and CLDN3 and poorly expressed miR-324-3p were identified in PC cells. The competitively binding between DPP10-AS1 and miR-324-3p was identified, and CLDN3 was targeted and downregulated by miR-324-3p. In addition, DPP10-AS1 was found to sequester miR-324-3p to release CLDN3 expression. DPP10-AS1 knockdown or miR-324-3p restoration diminished migration, invasion, tumor formation, microvessel density, and lymph node metastasis of PC cells, which was associated with CLDN3 downregulation.Conclusions:Taken together, the study identified the regulatory role of DPP10-AS1/miR-324-3p/CLDN3 axis in PC, offering a mechanistic basis suggesting DPP10-AS1 ablation as a therapeutic target against PC.
