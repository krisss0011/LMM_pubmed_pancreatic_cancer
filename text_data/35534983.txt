Emerging evidence has indicated that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are potential biomarkers and play crucial roles in cancer development. However, the functions and underlying mechanisms of lncRNA TPT1-AS1 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remain elusive. RNAseq data of PDAC tissues and normal tissues were analyzed, and lncRNAs which were associated with PDAC prognosis were identified. The clinical relevance of TPT1-AS1 for PDAC patients was explored, and the effects of TPT1-AS1 in PDAC progression were investigated in vitro and in vivo. LncRNA TPT1-AS1 was highly expressed in PDAC, and high TPT1-AS1 levels predicted a poor prognosis. Moreover, functional experiments revealed that TPT1-AS1 promoted pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, TPT1-AS1 functioned as an endogenous sponge for miR-30a-5p, which increased integrin Î²3 (ITGB3) level in pancreatic cancer cells. Conversely, our data revealed that ITGB3 could activate the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), which in turn bound directly to the TPT1-AS1 promoter and affected the expression of TPT1-AS1, thus forming a positive feedback loop with TPT1-AS1. Taken together, our results uncovered a reciprocal loop of TPT1-AS1 and ITGB3 which contributed to pancreatic cancer growth and development, and indicated that TPT1-AS1 might serve as a novel potential diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for PDAC patients.
