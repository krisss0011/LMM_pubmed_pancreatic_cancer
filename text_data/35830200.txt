Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by high heterogeneity, and the postoperative prognosis of different patients often varies greatly. Therefore, the classification of pancreatic cancer patients and precise treatment becomes particularly important. In our study,1H NMR spectroscopy was used to analyze the 76 PDAC serum samples and identify the potential metabolic subtypes. The metabolic characteristics of each metabolic subtype were screened out and the relationship between metabolic subtype and the long-term prognosis was further identified. The clinical stages of PDAC did not show the metabolic differences at the serum metabolomic level. And three metabolic subtypes, basic, choline-like and amino acid-enriched types, were defined by the hierarchical cluster analysis of the serum metabolites and the disturbed metabolic pathways. The characteristic metabolites of each PDAC subtype were identified, and the metabolite model was established to distinguish the PDAC patients in the different subtypes. Among the three metabolic subtypes, choline-like type displayed better long-term prognosis compared to the other two types of patients. Metabolic subtypes are of clinical importance and are closer to expressing the heterogeneity in the actual life activities of pancreatic cancer than molecular typing. The excavation of metabolic subtypes based on this will be more in line with clinical reality and more promising to guide clinical precision individualization treatment.
