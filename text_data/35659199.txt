Increasing evidence has reported that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) plays a vital role in the development of pancreatic cancer (PC). However, the function and mechanism of LINC01133 in PC tumorigenesis are still unknown. Herein, we found thatLINC01133was highly expressed in PC tissues and cell lines, andLINC01133knockdown could block the growth and metastasis of PC cells. Besides, upregulatedLINC01133in PC cells was induced byYin Yang 1 (YY1). Furthermore,LINC01133directly targetedmiR-199b-5pand promoted cancer malignancy by suppressingmiR-199b-5p. It was also discovered thatmyelin regulatory factor (MYRF)was targeted bymiR-199b-5pand positively correlated withLINC01133expression in PC, andLINC01133modulated PC progression throughmiR-199b-5p/MYRFpathway. In conclusion, we demonstrated thatYY1-mediated the upregulation ofLINC0113increasedMYRFexpression by spongingmiR-199b-5p, resulting in the accelerated development of PC. These findings might offer a novel insight into the development of efficient therapeutics for PC patients.
