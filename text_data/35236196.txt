The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy and feasibility of high-dose (72.6 Gy) planned adaptive intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) for 9 consecutive patients with synchronous oligometastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The estimated 2-year overall survival rate was 66.7%, and the local progression-free survival at 2 years was 83.3%. No severe adverse events were observed. Planned adaptive dose-escalated IMRT-SIB has the potential to improve local control rate and prolong overall survival in patients with synchronous oligometastatic PDAC.
