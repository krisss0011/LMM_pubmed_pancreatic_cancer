The patient-derived organoids (PDO) platform recapitulates the phenotype, genotype, and molecular characteristics of primary tumors. High-throughput drug screening in terms of pharmacotyping using standard-of-care chemotherapy agents in the PDO platform has shown promising sensitivities to guide precision medicine for individual patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) within a clinically relevant time frame.
