Purpose:Removal of obstructive jaundice in metastatic pancreatic cancer is an important part of palliative therapy. However, it is not known whether invasive procedures reduce cancer-related mortality. In this study, the effect of palliative biliary drainage on survival outcomes in pancreatic cancer patients was evaluated.Methods:Patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and undergoing biliary drainage in two different centers between 2010 and 2019 were evaluated retrospectively.Results:Biliary drainage was applied to 73 patients, constituting 20.6% of 355 patients included in the study. The median progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with biliary stent was 5 months, while the median PFS of patients without stenting was 5.5 months and the median overall survival (OS) was 11.1 and 11.5 months, respectively (p: 0.424, p: 0.802).Conclusions:A positive effect of palliative biliary drainage on median PFS and OS could not be demonstrated in our study group. In pancreatic cancer, predictive markers are needed to select patients who can derive a survival benefit from biliary drainage.
