Background:The short-term outcome and long-term survival of pancreaticoduodenectomy with additional para-aortic dissection (PAD) for patients with resectable pancreatic cancer remain obscure.Patients and methods:Consecutive patients who underwent radical pancreaticoduodenectomy for resectable pancreatic cancer in a single high-volume center during a 7-year period were included retrospectively. Both short- and long-term effects of PAD were compared between the PAD group and the no PAD group. Then, the PAD group was divided into the non-metastatic para-aortic lymph node (PALN-) group and the metastatic PALN (PALN+) group to further analyze the prognosis of PALN+.Results:Of the 909 included patients, 280 (30.8%) underwent PAD during pancreaticoduodenectomy. The PAD group had a higher rate of intra-abdominal infection compared with the no PAD group (28.6% vs. 20.7%, P = 0.009) but no differences were found in the incidence of other complications. The overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were also comparable between the two groups. Subgroup analysis showed that patients with PALN+ had a worse OS than patients in the PALN- group (median of 14 vs. 20 months, P = 0.048). Multivariate Cox regression analysis further revealed that PALN+ was an independent adverse predictor of OS (hazard ratio: 1.70, P = 0.007).Conclusions:This study suggests that the addition of PAD during pancreaticoduodenectomy does not improve the prognosis of patients with resectable pancreatic cancer and may lead to an increased risk of infection. However, the accurate preoperative assessment and appropriate treatment strategy for patients with PALN+ need further investigation due to the poor prognosis.
