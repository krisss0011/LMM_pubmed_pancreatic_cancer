Background:UGT1A1 polymorphisms should be considered when using irinotecan-containing regimens, especially in patients with a double-variant-type (DV), including homozygous for UGT1A1*28 and UGT1A1*6 and heterozygous for both UGT1A1*28 and UGT1A1*6. We investigated the safety and efficacy of modified FOLFIRINOX (mFOLFIRINOX) (irinotecan 80 mg/m2) in patients having DV.Methods:Patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who had received FOLFIRINOX between January 2015 and December 2019 were included in this study. Non-DV patients received the standard mFOLFIRINOX (irinotecan 150 mg/m2) as first-line (non-DV1) or second-line therapy (non-DV2); however, DV patients received mFOLFIRINOX (irinotecan 80 mg/m2) as the second-line therapy (DV2). We retrospectively evaluated the safety and efficacy of the lowered irinotecan dose in the DV2 group relative to the non-DV1 (safety) or non-DV2 (safety and efficacy) groups.Results:A total of 235 patients were eligible for this study with 118 patients in the non-DV1, 106 in the non-DV2, and 11 in the DV2 groups. Major grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (33.9, 31.1, and 18.2%) and febrile neutropenia (6.8, 3.8, and 9.1%) in the non-DV1, non-DV2, and DV2 groups, respectively. The median progression-free survival was 3.4 months in the non-DV2 group, and 4.4 months in the DV2 group. The overall survival from the date of starting second-line chemotherapy was 8.8 months in the non-DV2 group and 11.5 months in the DV2 group.Conclusions:Based on our findings, the safety and efficacy of mFOLFIRINOX (irinotecan 80 mg/m2) in DV patients were comparable with the standard mFOLFIRINOX (irinotecan 150 mg/m2) in non-DV patients.
