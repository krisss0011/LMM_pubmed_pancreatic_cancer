Pancreatic duct stenting using endoscopy or surgery is widely used for the 
management of benign and malignant pancreatic diseases. Endoscopic pancreatic 
stents are mainly used to relieve pain caused by chronic pancreatitis and 
pancreas divisum, and to treat pancreatic duct disruption and stenotic 
pancreaticointestinal anastomosis after surgery. They are also used to prevent 
postendoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis and 
postoperative pancreatic fistula, treat pancreatic cancer, and locate 
radiolucent stones. Recent advances in endoscopic techniques, such as endoscopic 
ultrasonography and balloon enteroscopy, and newly designed stents have 
broadened the indications for pancreatic duct stenting. In this review we 
outlined the types, insertion procedures, efficacy, and complications of 
endoscopic pancreatic duct stent placement, and summarized the applications of 
pancreatic duct stents in surgery.
