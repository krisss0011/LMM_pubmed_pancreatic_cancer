A woman in her 70s underwent distal pancreatectomy(D2 dissection)for a 
pancreatic tail carcinoma after a close examination of the cause of her poorly 
controlled diabetes mellitus. Intraoperative rapid peritoneal washing cytology 
showed no malignant findings, but histopathological examination revealed Ptb, 
TS2, tub2, pT3, ly1, v3, ne3, mpd0, pS0, pRP1, pOO0, pPCM0, pDPM0, pN0, pM0, 
pCY1, pStage â…¡A, R0(Pancreatic Cancer Treatment Protocol 7th Edition). The 
patient was treated with S-1 therapy for 6 months postoperatively and is alive 1 
year and 9 months without recurrence. The prognosis after resection of 
pancreatic cancer with positive peritoneal washing cytology is said to be worse 
than that of patients with negative, because of the high recurrence rate of 
peritoneal metastasis. We report a case of pancreatic tail carcinoma with 
positive peritoneal washing cytology with recurrence-free survival after surgery 
and chemotherapy.
