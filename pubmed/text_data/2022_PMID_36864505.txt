Previously, we confirmed that Mychonastes sp. 246 methanolic extract (ME) 
markedly reduced the viability of BxPC-3 human pancreatic cancer cells. However, 
the underlying mechanism ME remained unclear. Hence, we attempted to elucidate 
the anticancer effect of ME on BxPC-3 human pancreatic cancer cells. First, we 
investigated the components of ME and their cytotoxicity in normal cells. Then, 
we confirmed the G1 phase arrest mediated growth inhibitory effect of ME using a 
cell counting assay and cell cycle analysis. Moreover, we found that the 
migration-inhibitory effect of ME using a Transwell migration assay. Through RNA 
sequencing, Gene Ontology-based network analysis, and western blotting, we 
explored the intracellular mechanisms of ME in BxPC-3 cells. ME modulated the 
intracellular energy metabolism-related pathway by altering the mRNA levels of 
IGFBP3 and PPARGC1A in BxPC-3 cells and reduced PI3K and mTOR phosphorylation by 
upregulating IGFBP3 and 4E-BP1 expression. Finally, we verified that ME reduced 
the growth of three-dimensional (3D) pancreatic cancer spheroids. Our study 
demonstrates that ME suppresses pancreatic cancer proliferation through the 
IGFBP3-PI3K-mTOR signaling pathway. This is the first study on the anticancer 
effect of the ME against pancreatic cancer, suggesting therapeutic possibilities 
and the underlying mechanism of ME action.
