Serial pancreatic juice aspiration cytological examination(SPACE)has been 
reported as a reliable preoperative diagnostic method for early pancreatic 
cancer, when combined with imaging findings suspecting early pancreatic cancer. 
Among 259 patients with suspected pancreatic cancer who underwent pancreatic 
resection at our hospital, SPACE was preoperatively performed in 14 cases(5.4%). 
Of these 14 cases, final pathological diagnosis was pancreatic cancer in 12 
patients (86%), including 5 patients with Stage ⅠA pancreatic cancer(35.7%), all 
of whom had a mass on preoperative CT or EUS. On the other hand, in the other 2 
cases(14.3%), CT/EUS detected no mass but focal pancreatic parenchymal atrophy 
and main pancreatic duct stenosis which were the imaging findings suspecting 
very early pancreatic cancer such as cancer in situ. Although preoperative SPACE 
results of these 2 cases were class Ⅳ, final pathological results of resected 
specimen were low-grade PanIN in both cases. SPACE was considered useful for 
preoperative diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in our study, however further study 
is needed to examine its diagnostic accuracy for early pancreatic cancer which 
does not appear as a mass in any imaging modality.
