BACKGROUND: Because of the unique tumor microenvironment (TME), immunotherapy 
and targeted therapies have shown limited efficacy in treating pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma (PAAD). CD8 + T cells play crucial roles in regulating the TME in 
PAAD; therefore, exploring the function of CD8 + T-cell-related genes (CD8RGs) 
in PAAD has high potential clinical value and could provide a comprehensive 
understanding of the microenvironment of PAAD.
METHODS: We employed the weighted gene coexpression network analysis and 
CIBERSORT algorithms to assess PAAD transcriptome data from The Cancer Genome 
Atlas (TCGA) dataset and identify modules strongly associated with CD8 + T cell 
infiltration. Using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression 
analysis and Kaplan-Meier curves, we developed a prognostic risk score model for 
patients with PAAD. We validated this model using single-cell and transcriptome 
datasets obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). We also examined the 
correlations between the risk score and factors such as the TME, clinical 
characteristics, and tumor mutation burden (TMB). Gene Ontology and Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis were performed on 
differentially expressed genes between the high- and low-risk groups. In 
addition, the Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion website and "pRRophetic" R 
package were used to predict response to immunotherapy and chemotherapy in the 
high- and low-risk groups, respectively. Finally, we analyzed the expressions of 
hub genes at the cellular level with quantitative real-time PCR.
RESULTS: A risk model based on five CD8RGs was established and validated using 
TCGA and GEO datasets. The low-risk group exhibited significantly longer overall 
and progression-free survival. A positive correlation between the TMB and the 
risk score was observed. The TME analysis revealed a significant correlation 
between the risk score and immune function, as well as immune checkpoints. The 
expression of hub genes was significantly correlated with the infiltration level 
of CD8 + T cells. The high-risk group responded better to immunotherapy, 
paclitaxel, cisplatin, mitomycin C, afatinib (BIBW2992), and gefitinib. In 
contrast, the low-risk group showed higher sensitivity to sunitinib, MK.2206, 
palbociclib (PD.0332991), and axitinib. Compared with that in normal pancreatic 
epithelial cells, the expression levels of BCL11A, PHOSPHO1, and GNG7 were 
significantly decreased, while those of KLK11 and VCAM1 were significantly 
increased in pancreatic tumor cells.
CONCLUSIONS: CD8RGs play an important role in regulating the TME of PAAD. Five 
hub genes-BCL11A, KLK11, GNG7, PHOSPHO1, and VCAM1-are closely associated with 
the prognosis of PAAD patients, providing new references for the exploration of 
biomarkers. Furthermore, our findings offer novel insights for clinical 
decision-making.
