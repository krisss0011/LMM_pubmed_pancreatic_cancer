BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a major contributor to global 
cancer-related mortality. While the inhibitory effect of metformin (Met) on PC 
has been reported, the underlying mechanism remains elusive.
METHODS: We established BxPC-3 cell models with miR-378a-3p and VEGFA knockdown. 
The expression of miR-378a-3p, VEGFA, and RGC-32 in PC and normal tissues was 
analyzed using GEPIA, TCGA databases. Cell proliferation, invasion, migration, 
and apoptosis were assessed through CCK8, Transwell, wound healing, and flow 
cytometry.
RESULTS: Significantly lower expression of miR-378a-3p was observed in PC 
tissues and cells. Knockdown of miR-378a-3p reversed the impact of Met on cell 
viability in PANC-1 and BxPC3. VEGFA emerged as a potential regulator in PC and 
a downstream target of miR-378a-3p. The interaction between VEGFA and RGC-32 
played a crucial role in PC regulation. Knockdown of VEGFA substantially 
reversed the impact of miR-378a-3p inhibitor on tumor growth and the 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Moreover, knockdown of VEGFA 
effectively countered the influence of miR-378a-3p inhibitor on cell viability 
and the EMT process in BxPC3 cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Met exerted inhibitory effects on PC through the 
miR-378a-3p/VEGFA/RGC-32 pathway. Strategies targeting the 
miR-378a-3p/VEGFA/RGC-32 axis represent a novel avenue for the prevention and 
treatment of PC.
