Pancreatic cancer remains a disease with unmet clinical needs and inadequate 
diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers. In-depth characterization of 
the disease proteome is limited. This study thus aims to define and describe 
protein networks underlying pancreatic cancer and identify protein centric 
subtypes with clinical relevance. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics was used to 
identify and quantify the proteome in tumor tissue, tumor-adjacent tissue, and 
patient-derived xenografts (PDX)-derived cell lines from patients with 
pancreatic cancer, and tissues from patients with chronic pancreatitis. We 
identified, quantified, and characterized 11,634 proteins from 72 pancreatic 
tissue samples. Network focused analysis of the proteomics data led to 
identification of a tumor epithelium-specific module and an extracellular matrix 
(ECM)-associated module that discriminated pancreatic tumor tissue from both 
tumor adjacent tissue and pancreatitis tissue. On the basis of the ECM module, 
we defined an ECM-high and an ECM-low subgroup, where the ECM-high subgroup was 
associated with poor prognosis (median survival months: 15.3 vs. 22.9 months; 
log-rank test, P = 0.02). The ECM-high tumors were characterized by elevated 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition and glycolytic activities, and low oxidative 
phosphorylation, E2F, and DNA repair pathway activities. This study offers novel 
insights into the protein network underlying pancreatic cancer opening up for 
proteome precision medicine development.
SIGNIFICANCE: Pancreatic cancer lacks reliable biomarkers for prognostication 
and treatment of patients. We analyzed the proteome of pancreatic tumors, 
nonmalignant tissues of the pancreas and PDX-derived cell lines, and identified 
proteins that discriminate between patients with good and poor survival. The 
proteomics data also unraveled potential novel drug targets.
