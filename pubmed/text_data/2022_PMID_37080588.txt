BACKGROUND: Approximately 20%-40% of patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) 
disease, an autosomal dominant hereditary disease, exhibit large deletions 
(LDs). Few studies have focused on this population. Hence, we aimed to elucidate 
the genotype-phenotype correlations and clinical outcomes in VHL patients with 
LDs.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, we included 119 patients with VHL disease 
from 50 unrelated families in whom LDs were detected using traditional and 
next-generation sequencing methods. Other germline mutations were confirmed by 
Sanger sequencing. Genotype-phenotype correlations and survival were analysed in 
different groups using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression. We also evaluated 
therapeutic response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy.
RESULTS: The overall penetrance of patients aged <60 was 95.2%. Two VHL patients 
with LDs also carried CHEK2 and FLCN germline mutations. An earlier age of onset 
of retinal haemangioblastoma was observed in the next generation. Patients with 
exon 2 deletion of VHL had an earlier onset age of renal cell carcinoma and 
pancreatic lesions. The risk of renal cell carcinoma was lower in VHL patients 
with LDs and a BRK1 deletion. The group with earlier age of onset received 
poorer prognosis. Four of eight (50%) patients showed partial response to TKI 
therapy.
CONCLUSION: The number of generations and the status of exon 2 could affect age 
of onset of VHL-related manifestations. Onset age was an independent risk factor 
for overall survival. TKI therapy was effective in VHL patients with LDs. Our 
findings would further support clinical surveillance and decision-making 
processes.
