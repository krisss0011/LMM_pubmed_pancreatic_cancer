Despite technological advances in radiation therapy for cancer treatment, many 
patient populations still experience mediocre survival percentages, local 
control, and quality of life. Additionally, much of the world lacks access to 
expensive, modern treatment options. The need for innovative, cost-effective 
solutions that can improve patient treatment outcomes is essential. 
Phytomedicines have been shown to induce apoptotic tumor cell death, diminish 
tumor progression, reduce cancer incidence, alleviate harmful hypoxic 
conditions, and more. While an ample amount of research is available that 
characterizes many phytomedicines as having anti-cancer properties that increase 
tumor cell killing/control and mitigate the harmful side effects of radiation 
damage, little work has been done to investigate the synergistic effect of 
phytoradiotherapy: combining radiation treatment with phytomedicines. In this 
study, a protocol for testing the radiosensitizing effects of phytomedicines was 
validated and used to investigate the well-known plant based medicine 
cannabidiol (CBD) and the lesser-known medicinal fruit Bitter Melon. 
Additionally, based on its high concentration of plant hemoglobin which has been 
shown to abate hypoxia, the African-indigenous Justicia plant was tested in 
pancreatic adenocarcinoma mouse models. The studies reveal that these 
phytomedicines can effectively enhance tumor cell killing, minimize tumor 
growth, and prolong mice survival. There is certainly the need for additional 
research in this regard, however, phytoradiotherapy: the use of phytomedicines 
to enhance radiation therapy treatment outcomes, continues to show potential as 
a promising, innovative way to improve cancer care.
