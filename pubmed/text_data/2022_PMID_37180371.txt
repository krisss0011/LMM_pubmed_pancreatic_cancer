Irreversible electroporation (IRE) employs the use of an electric field to cause 
irreversible permeability of the cell membrane, inducing apoptosis. The use of 
IRE for locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) was first described in 2012. 
The crucial advantage of IRE compared with other devices employing thermal 
ablation is the safety around vital structures such as vessels and ducts. This 
makes it an attractive option for use in the pancreas due to the close proximity 
of multiple major vascular structures, biliary ducts, and adjacent 
gastrointestinal organs. Over the past decade, IRE has established itself as a 
useful treatment adjunct and may soon become the standard of care, particularly 
for LAPC. This article will explore the current evidence and provide a concise 
summary of pertinent issues, including patient selection, preoperative 
management, clinical outcomes, radiological response and future prospects of IRE 
in pancreatic cancer.
