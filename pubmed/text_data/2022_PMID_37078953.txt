OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of cytokine-induced killer (CIK) 
cell therapy in pancreatic cancer.
METHODS: An orthotopic murine model of pancreatic cancer and adjuvant 
therapy-mimicking xenograft murine model that underwent splenectomy was created. 
Eighty mice were randomized into four groups: the control, gemcitabine alone, 
CIK alone, and CIK with gemcitabine groups. The tumor growth was monitored using 
bioluminescence imaging once weekly.
RESULTS: In the orthotopic murine model, the treatment groups showed a 
significantly longer survival than the control group (median: not reached vs 
125.0 days; 95% confidence interval, 119.87-130.13; P = 0.04); however, the 
overall survival did not differ significantly among the treatment groups (P = 
0.779). The metastatic recurrence rate and overall survival were also not 
significantly different among the groups in the adjuvant therapy-mimicking 
xenograft murine model (P = 0.497). However, the CIK and gemcitabine combination 
suppressed the metastatic recurrence effectively, with recurrence-free survival 
being significantly longer in the CIK with gemcitabine group than in the control 
group (median, 54 days; 95% confidence interval, 25.00-102.00; P = 0.013).
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of CIK and gemcitabine suppressed systemic 
metastatic recurrence, with promising efficacy and good tolerability in an 
adjuvant setting of pancreatic cancer.
