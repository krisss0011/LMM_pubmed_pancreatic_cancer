BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a highly lethal cancer with 
a poor prognosis, is expected to become the second deadliest cancer in the 
United States by 2030. Despite advancements in treatment modalities, the 
survival rates of patients with PDAC have remained low. Immunotherapy has 
emerged as a promising treatment for various cancers; however, its utilization 
in PDAC has been limited due to various challenges, including resistance 
mechanisms and the advanced stage at which most patients are diagnosed.
METHODS: We analyzed data from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) from 2010 to 
2017, focusing on the impact of race, insurance status, and socioeconomic 
factors among patients with stage IV PDAC using logistic regression analyses.
RESULTS: Among 109,663 patients with stage IV PDAC, 421 (0.38%) received 
immunotherapy. The recipients were younger (median age 63 vs. 68 years, 
p < 0.001) and more likely to be white (87.4% vs. 82.1%). Patients with private 
insurance or Medicare (p < 0.001), and those earning more than $60 k annually 
(51.0% vs. 36.4%, p < 0.001) were more likely to receive immunotherapy. 
Treatment was more likely in academic/research programs than in community cancer 
programs (53.0% vs. 33.4%, p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, Black patients 
had lower odds of receiving immunotherapy than Caucasian patients (OR: 0.74 [95% 
CI: 0.601-0.882], p = 0.019). Higher income was also a significant predictor of 
immunotherapy utilization (highest vs. lowest income quartile: OR, 2.228 [95% 
CI: 1.422-3.491], p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed significant disparities in immunotherapy access 
for stage IV PDAC based on race, socioeconomic status, and geographic location 
in the United States, highlighting the need for intervention to promote 
equitable access to this promising treatment modality.
