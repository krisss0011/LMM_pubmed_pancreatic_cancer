Gastric carcinoma is the fifth most common and the third leading cause of cancer 
deaths worldwide. The incidence of diffuse-type gastric cancer, of which signet 
ring cell carcinoma is a subtype, is rising in the world. Due to non-specific 
gastritis-like symptoms, difficulty in assessing true tumor characteristics 
owing to its horizontal spread, and non-distinguishable endoscopic appearance 
from other gastric pathologies, the diagnosis of this subtype is challenging. We 
present a case of a 67-year-old woman with progressively worsening abdominal 
pain who came for an endoscopic ultrasound evaluation of an incidentally noted 
pancreatic cyst on a previous MRI. During endoscopy, a 1-cm gastric ulcer was 
noted along the lesser curvature of the gastric body. Biopsy confirmed a 
diagnosis of gastric signet ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) with CDX-2 and keratin 
positivity. The patient underwent total gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y 
reconstruction. Gross specimen revealed a diffuse SRCC invading the muscularis 
propria, along with lymphovascular and perineural invasion. In the context of 
our case, we discuss the morphological features of SRCC and the effectiveness of 
treatment options based on existing literature. Early accurate diagnosis and 
staging play an important role in determining treatment options as well as the 
clinical course of gastric SRCC.
