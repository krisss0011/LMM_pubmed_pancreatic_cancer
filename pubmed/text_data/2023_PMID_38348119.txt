BACKGROUND: Natural orifice specimen extraction surgery (NOSES) has been widely 
applied to the treatment of colorectal cancer. This study aim to investigate the 
short-term and survival outcomes of transrectal specimen extraction after 
laparoscopic right hemicolectomy.
METHODS: From January 2016 to December 2021, a total of 166 consecutive patients 
with right colon cancer who underwent laparoscopic right hemicolectomy in Cancer 
Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Beijing Hospital were 
identified. Baseline data, perioperative parameters, anal function, inflammatory 
indicators and survival outcomes were collected and compared.
RESULTS: Totally, 24 patients who underwent transrectal NOSE were matched with 
24 patients who received conventional laparoscopic surgery (LAP). Patients in 
NOSES group had a significantly lower incidence of incision infection (0 vs 
20.8%, P=0.048), faster recovery of gastrointestinal function (2.1 vs 3,1 days, 
P=0.032) compared with those in LAP group. In addition, patients in the NOSE 
group experienced significantly less postoperative pain on POD1 (2.3 vs 4.4, 
P<0.001), POD3 (2.1 vs 3.9, P<0.001), and POD5 (1.7 vs 2.8, P=0.011). Regarding 
to anal function 6 months after surgery, no significant difference was observed 
in Wexner incontinence scale (9.8 vs 9.5, P=0.559) between the two groups. In 
terms of indicators of the inflammatory response, there were no significant 
differences in body temperature, neutrophils, and PCT levels between the two 
groups. However, CRP levels in the NOSES group on POD 3 (6.9 vs 5.1 mg/L, 
P=0.016) and POD 5 (3.8 vs 2.6 mg/L, P=0.027) were significantly higher than in 
the LAP group. With regarded to survival outcomes, patients in the NOSES group 
were similar to those in the LAP group for 3-year OS (100% vs 91.2%, P=0.949), 
3-year DFS (86.2% vs 84.8%, P=0.949), and 3-year LRFS (94.2% vs 88.7%, P=0.549).
CONCLUSION: For total laparoscopic right hemicolectomy, transrectal NOSE is 
effective and safe, and associated with lower incidence of wound infection, less 
pain, faster recovery, and similar survival outcomes compared to conventional 
laparoscopic surgery.
