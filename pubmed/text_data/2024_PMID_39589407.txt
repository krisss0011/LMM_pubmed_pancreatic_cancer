BACKGROUND: This study aimed to report the long-term outcomes after surgical 
resection for invasive (I) intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) and to 
define prognostic factors for survival.
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated all consecutive pancreatic resections 
performed IPMN between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2022. Multivariate Cox 
analysis identified risk factors for survival.
RESULTS: Surgery for IPMN was performed in 125 patients including 78 I-IPMN 
(62%). Ninety-day mortality rates was 1.6% (n = 2) with an overall morbidity 
rate of 44.4%. I-IPMN showed higher serum CA 19 - 9 serum values (p < 0.0001), 
more frequently jaundice (p = 0.008), more high-risk stigmata (p = 0.002) and 
diffuse IPMN form (p = 0.005) compared with non-invasive IPMN. The median 
overall survival for I-IPMN was 178.36 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 
87.01-NR) with overall survival rates at one, three, five, and 10 years of 91%, 
75%, 72%, and 62%, respectively. Jaundice (hazard ratio [HR]: 4.23; 95% CI: 
1.48-12.07; p = 0.006), T3 lesions (HR: 3.24; 95% CI: 1.65-6.39; p = 0.006), 
absence of lymph node involvement (HR: 0.15; 95% CI: 0.04-0.60; p = 0.0007), R1 
margin status (HR: 2.96;95%CI:1.08-8:15;p = 0.03) and need for venous resection 
(HR: 4.30; 95% CI: 1.26-14.6; p = 0.006) were identified as independent risk 
factors for survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survival and cure can be observed after surgical 
resection of pancreatic adenocarcinomas originating from I-IPMN when resected at 
early stage (Tis, T1, T2). I-IPMN spreading beyond pancreatic ducts (jaundice, 
T3 lesions, lymph nodes, Veins) have limited long-term survival.
