Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal neoplasms worldwide; it is 
aggressive in nature and has a poor prognosis. The overall survival rate for 
pancreatic cancer is low. Most patients present non-specific symptoms in the 
advanced stages, which generally leads to late diagnosis, at which point there 
is no option for curative surgery. The treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer 
includes systemic therapy, in some cases radiotherapy, and more recently, 
molecular targeted therapies, which can positively impact cancer control and 
improve quality of life. This review provides an overview of the molecular 
landscape of pancreatic cancer based on the most recent literature, as well as 
current treatment options for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.
