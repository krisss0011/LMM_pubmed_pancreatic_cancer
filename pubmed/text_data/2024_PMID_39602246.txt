The genetic characteristics of pancreatic cancer (PC) are being revealed, but 
treatment strategies based on these profiles are developing slowly. About 
one-third of PC patients harbor SMAD4 mutations, with its homozygous deletions 
often accompanied by deletions of the malic enzyme 2 (ME2) gene, leading to 
upregulation of malic enzyme 3 (ME3) to eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS). 
We designed an aptamer-modified octahedral DNA nanostructure for targeted 
co-delivery of siRNA targeting ME3 (siME3) and doxorubicin (DOX). This 
nanostructure targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on the 
membrane of PC cells. Upon internalization, siME3 and DOX are released 
intracellularly. The siME3 effectively inhibited ME3 expression, diminishing the 
tumor cells' capacity to clear ROS. Moreover, DOX further increases the level of 
cellular ROS, and the sustained accumulation of ROS ultimately leads to 
apoptosis of ME2-deficient PC cells. This targeting nanostructure shows 
potential for enhancing collateral lethality in this PC subgroup.
