BACKGROUND & AIMS: The effectiveness of adjuvant immunotherapy to diminish 
recurrence and improve long-term prognosis following curative-intent surgical 
resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is of increased interest, 
especially among individuals at high risk of recurrence. The objective of the 
current study was to investigate the impact of adjuvant immunotherapy on 
long-term recurrence and survival after curative resection among patients with 
intermediate/advanced HCC.
METHODS: Using a prospectively-collected multicenter database, patients who 
underwent curative-intent resection for Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) 
stage B/C HCC were identified. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was used 
to compare recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) between 
patients treated with and without adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). 
Multivariate Cox-regression analysis further identified independent factors of 
RFS and OS.
RESULTS: Among the 627 enrolled patients, 109 patients (23.3%) received adjuvant 
immunotherapy. Most ICI-related adverse reactions were grading I-II. PSM 
analysis created 99 matched pairs of patients with comparable baseline 
characteristics between patients treated with and without adjuvant 
immunotherapy. In the PSM cohort, the median RFS (29.6 vs. 19.3 months, P=0.031) 
and OS (35.1 vs. 27.8 months, P=0.036) were better among patients who received 
adjuvant immunotherapy versus patients who did not. After adjustment for other 
confounding factors on multivariable analyzes, adjuvant immunotherapy remained 
independently associated with favorable RFS (HR: 0.630; 95% CI: 0.435-0.914; 
P=0.015) and OS (HR: 0.601; 95% CI: 0.401-0.898; P=0.013). Subgroup analyzes 
identified potentially prognostic benefits of adjuvant immunotherapy among 
patients with intermediate-stage and advanced-stage HCC.
CONCLUSION: This real-world observational study demonstrated that adjuvant 
immunotherapy was associated with improved RFS and OS following curative-intent 
resection of intermediate/advanced HCC. Future randomized controlled trials are 
warranted to establish definitive evidence for this specific population at high 
risks of recurrence.
