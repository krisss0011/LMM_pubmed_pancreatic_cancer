This case report describes the diagnosis, treatment, and progression of a 
50-year-old male patient diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic leiomyosarcoma with 
metastases to the liver, lungs, and brain, representing the only case involving 
both the pancreas and brain documented in the hospital registry with a 
histopathological diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma. The patient initially presented 
with chronic abdominal pain, constipation, and weight loss, and subsequent CT 
scans revealed a large pancreatic mass with metastases to the liver, lungs, and 
brain. A biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma, and the patient 
underwent eight cycles of palliative chemotherapy with cisplatin and docetaxel, 
along with palliative radiotherapy targeting the brain metastases. Despite these 
interventions, the disease progressed, resulting in the patient experiencing 
altered mental status, generalized weakness, and seizure-like activity, 
reflecting the impact of the brain metastases and overall disease progression. 
His management included treatment with dexamethasone, antiseizure medications, 
and supportive care, while discussions about palliative care options were 
conducted with the family. This rare case highlights the aggressive nature of 
pancreatic leiomyosarcoma, characterized by rapid progression and resistance to 
chemotherapy and radiotherapy, with the involvement of multiple organ systems 
demonstrating the challenges associated with managing advanced metastatic 
leiomyosarcoma.
