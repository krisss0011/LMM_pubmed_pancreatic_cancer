BACKGROUND: WASF2 regulates actin reorganization during cell migration. WASF2 
has been identified as a regulator of the development of gastric cancer, breast 
cancer, and pancreatic cancer. But its regulatory mechanisms remain unknown. 
Also, its function was absent in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). 
Consequently, we examined the effect of DNA methylation on aberrant WASF2 
expression in HNSCC.
METHODS: TNMplot, TIMER, GSEA pathway analysis, and the Kaplan-Meier Plotter 
database were used to analyze the expression, function, and prognostic value of 
WASF2, as well as the correlation between WASF2 and infiltrating immune cells in 
HNSCC or pan-cancer analysis. WASF2 promoter methylation levels and the 
correlation between WASF2 expression and WASF2 promoter methylation in HNSCC 
were evaluated using the DNMIVD database. The effect of DNA methylation 
inhibitor on WASF2 expression was demonstrated in the GEO database. Finally, the 
TISIDB database determined the relationships between WASF2 methylation, immune 
cell infiltration, and immune inhibitors.
RESULTS: WASF2 was significantly downregulated in HNSCC tissues where WASF2 
promoter methylation was elevated. According to the GEO database, treatment with 
a DNA methylation inhibitor notably restored the mRNA expression of WASF2. WASF2 
expression was also a favorable indicator of human papilloma virus 
(HPV)-positive HNSCC. Its level of promoter methylation had detrimental effects 
on patient survival. In addition, patients with elevated levels of WASF2 
demonstrated active G2/M regulation, TGF-Î² signaling, Kras signaling, fatty acid 
metabolism, and p53 pathways. WASF2 was positively associated with tumor-killing 
immune cells, while WASF2 methylation was positively related to 
immunosuppressive cells and immune-inhibitors.
CONCLUSIONS: Hypermethylated WASF2 acted as a tumor suppressor of HNSCC by 
regulating tumor formation and immune imbalance.
