This study focuses on the synthesis of Biguanide-PROTACs, formed by conjugating 
the biguanide motif with a spacer and a ligand for recognition subunits of two 
E3 ubiquitin ligases. Evaluation of their activity on pancreatic cancer cell 
(KP4) proliferation established a correlation between membrane permeability and 
median effective concentration. Mechanistic insights revealed that only two 
compounds exhibited biguanide-like AMPK activation, while only one hydrophobic 
compound uniquely altered mitochondrial protein levels. The prospect of 
developing and expanding the Biguanide-PROTAC library holds several promises, 
offering potential insights into biguanide mechanisms and the creation of more 
potent anticancer agents. This study contributes to understanding the intricate 
interplay between compound structure, permeability, and anticancer activity, 
paving the way for targeted drug development in pancreatic cancer treatment.
