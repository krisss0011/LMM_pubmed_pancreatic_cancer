BACKGROUND: The role of cellular senescence in the tumor microenvironment of 
pancreatic cancer (PC) remains unclear, particularly regarding its impact on 
prognosis and immunotherapy outcomes.
METHODS: We utilized single-cell sequencing datasets (GSE155698 and GSE154778) 
for pancreatic cancer from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and bulk 
RNA-seq data from the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) and 
International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) repositories, creating three 
patient cohorts: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort, PAAD-AU cohort, and 
PAAD-CA cohort. Dimensionality reduction cluster analysis processed the 
single-cell data, while weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and 
differential expression gene analysis were applied to bulk RNA-seq data. 
Prognostic models were developed using Cox proportional hazards (COX) and least 
absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, with validation 
through survival analysis, decision curve analysis, and principal component 
analysis (PCA). Tumor mutation data were analyzed using the "maftools" package, 
and the immune microenvironment was assessed with TIMER2 data.
RESULTS: We developed a senescence-related (SENR) six-gene prognostic signature 
for PC, which stratifies patients by risk, with high-risk groups showing poorer 
prognoses. This model also offers predictive insights into tumor mutations and 
immune microenvironment characteristics. Caveolin-1 (CAV1) emerged as a 
significant prognostic biomarker, with functional validation showing its role in 
promoting cancer cell proliferation and migration, highlighting its potential as 
a therapeutic target.
CONCLUSION: This study provides a novel senescence-related prognostic tool for 
PC, enhancing patient stratification for prognosis and immunotherapy, and 
identifies CAV1 as a key gene with clinical significance for targeted 
interventions.
