OBJECTIVES: Differential diagnosis between pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 
(PDAC) and benign mimickers can be very difficult on small histological samples, 
such as fine needle aspiration biopsies (FNAB). We aimed to investigate the 
diagnostic value of immunostaining for IMP3, Maspin, S100A4, S100P, TFF2, and 
TFF3 in FNAB pancreatic lesions.
METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 20 consecutive patients with suspected PDAC, 
collecting FNABs at our department between 2019 and 2021.
RESULTS: Three of the 20 enrolled patients resulted negative for all 
immunohistochemical markers, while all the others were positive for Maspin. All 
other immunohistochemistry (IHC) markers had sensitivity and accuracy of less 
than 100%. On the basis of the IHC, the preoperative diagnosis on FNAB was 
nonmalignant lesions in the IHC negative cases and PDAC in the others. All 
patients subsequently underwent surgery for the pancreatic solid mass 
demonstrated by imaging techniques. The concordance between the preoperative and 
postoperative diagnosis was 100%; all IHC negative samples were diagnosed on 
surgical specimens as chronic pancreatitis and Maspin-positive samples as PDAC.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that even in the presence of little 
histological material, such as FNAB, the use of Maspin alone is sufficient to 
discriminate between PDAC and nonmalignant pancreatic lesions, with 100% 
accuracy.
