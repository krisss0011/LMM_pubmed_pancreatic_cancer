Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN) is an extremely rare tumor with low 
malignant potential which is generally located in the tail of the pancreas. The 
prevalence of SPN has increased with the recent advancement in radiological 
imaging. CECT abdomen and Endoscopic ultrasound-FNA are excellent modalities in 
preoperative diagnosis. Surgery is the main treatment modality of choice and a 
successful R0 resection is curative. We present a case of solid pseudopapillary 
neoplasm and included a summary of the current literature to provide a reference 
for the management of this rare clinical entity.
