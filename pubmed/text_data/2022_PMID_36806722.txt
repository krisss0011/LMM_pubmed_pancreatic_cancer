BACKGROUND: Elevated tissue factor (TF) expression, although restricted in 
normal tissue, has been reported in multiple solid cancers, and expression has 
been associated with poor prognosis. This manuscript compares TF expression 
across various solid tumor types via immunohistochemistry in a single study, 
which has not been performed previously.
AIMS: To increase insight in the prevalence and cellular localization of TF 
expression across solid cancer types, we performed a detailed and systematic 
analysis of TF expression in tumor tissue obtained from patients with ovarian, 
esophageal, bladder, cervical, endometrial, pancreatic, prostate, colon, breast, 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma 
(HNSCC), and glioblastoma. The spatial and temporal variation of TF expression 
was analyzed over time and upon disease progression in patient-matched biopsies 
taken at different timepoints. In addition, TF expression in patient-matched 
primary tumor and metastatic lesions was also analyzed.
METHODS AND RESULTS: TF expression was detected via immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
using a validated TF-specific antibody. TF was expressed in all cancer types 
tested, with highest prevalence in pancreatic cancer, cervical cancer, colon 
cancer, glioblastoma, HNSCC, and NSCLC, and lowest in breast cancer. Staining 
was predominantly membranous in pancreatic, cervical, and HNSCC, and cytoplasmic 
in glioblastoma and bladder cancer. In general, expression was consistent 
between biopsies obtained from the same patient over time, although variability 
was observed for individual patients. NSCLC biopsies of primary tumor and 
matched lymph node metastases showed no clear difference in TF expression 
overall, although individual patient changes were observed.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that TF is expressed across a broad range of solid 
cancer types, and expression is present upon tumor dissemination and over the 
course of treatment.
