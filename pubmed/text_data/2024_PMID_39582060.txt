Advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a dismal prognosis. 
Immunotherapy alone offers limited efficacy, but it is still unknown whether its 
combination with chemotherapy could offer synergistic anti-tumor effects. This 
phase Ib/II study evaluated the safety and efficacy of combining toripalimab 
with the gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel (GnP) regimen as first-line treatment 
for locally advanced or metastatic PDAC and explored predictive biomarkers 
(ChiCTR2000032293). The primary endpoints were safety and overall survival (OS). 
The secondary outcomes were objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate 
(DCR), and progression-free survival (PFS). Immune-related biomarkers including 
programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, genetic status, cytokine levels, 
and spatial features of the tumor immune microenviroment (TIME) were 
investigated. Neither serious treatment-related adverse events nor grade 4 
immune-related adverse events were reported. Among the 72 patients, the median 
OS was 8.9 months, 12-month OS rate was 31.9%, with median PFS of 5.6 months, 
ORR of 33.3%, and DCR of 90.3%. Higher PD-L1 expression, without liver 
metastases were associated with higher ORR, however these factors could not 
effectively distinguish responders and non-responders. Importantly, dendritic 
cells - T helper cells - cytotoxic T lymphocytes (DC-Th-CTL) enriched immune 
niche and their spatial interactions were dominant predictors of response based 
on TIME analysis using a cyclic multiplex tissue staining assay, with an area 
under the curve value of 0.8. Overall, GnP plus toripalimab exhibited good 
safety and differentiated efficacy in selected population, and the spatial 
interactions of DC-Th-CTL represent promising predictors to efficacy of 
immunochemotherapy in locally advanced or metastatic PDAC.
