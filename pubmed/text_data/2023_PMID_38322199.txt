BACKGROUND: We aim to investigate the prevalence, patterns, risk factors, and 
outcomes of peritoneal metastases (PM) after curative laparoscopic hepatectomy 
(LH) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
METHODS: A multicenter cohort of 2,138 HCC patients who underwent curative LH 
from August 2010 to December 2016 from seven hospitals in China was 
retrospectively analyzed. The incidence of PM following LH was evaluated and 
compared with that in open hepatectomy (OH) after 1:1 propensity score matching 
(PSM).
RESULTS: PM prevalence was 5.1% (15/295) in the early period [2010-2013], 2.6% 
(47/1,843) in the later period [2014-2016], and 2.9% (62/2,138) in all LH 
patients, which was similar to 4.0% (59/1,490) in the OH patients. The 
recurrence patterns, timing, and treatment did not significantly vary between 
the LH and OH patients (P>0.05). Multivariate logistic regression revealed that 
tumor diameter >5 cm, non-anatomical resection, presence of microvascular 
invasion, and lesions <2 cm from major blood vessels were independent risk 
factors of PM after LH. Of the 62 cases with PM, 26 (41.9%) had PM only, 34 
(54.9%) had intrahepatic recurrence (IHR) and PM, and 2 (3.2%) had synchronous 
extraperitoneal metastases (EPM). Patients with resectable PM had a 5-year 
overall survival (OS) of 65.0% compared to 9.0% for unresectable PM (P=0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence, patterns and independent risk factors of PM were 
identified for HCC patients after LH. LH was not associated with increased 
incidence of PM in HCC patients for experienced surgeons. Surgical re-excision 
of PM was associated with prolonged survival.
