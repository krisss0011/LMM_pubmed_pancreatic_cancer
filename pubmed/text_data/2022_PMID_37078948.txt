OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to reinterpret the prognostic prediction of 
p53 expression categories in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with exploration 
of the relationship between TP53 mutation genotype and p53 expression pattern.
METHODS: Data were retrospectively collected from consecutive patients who 
underwent primary pancreatic resection. Complete loss of function of TP53 is 
defined as nonsense and frameshift mutations. A tissue microarray was used to 
evaluate p53 expression by immunohistochemistry and was categorized as 
regulated, high, or negative.
RESULTS: The κ coefficient for agreement between p53 expression and TP53 was 
0.761. Cox regression analyses revealed that p53 expression (high vs regulated: 
hazard ratio [HR], 2.225; P < 0.001; negative vs regulated: HR, 2.788; P < 
0.001), tumor-node-metastasis stage (II vs I: HR, 3.471; P < 0.001; III vs I: 
HR, 6.834; P < 0.001), and tumor grade (G3/4 vs G1/2: HR, 1.958; P < 0.001) were 
independent prognostic factors in developing cohort and validation cohort. In 
subgroups of stage I, II, and III, compared with regulated expression, the 
patients with negative expression had a worse prognosis in both cohorts (P < 
0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that 3-tier p53 expression in resectable 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma provided independent prognostic information 
complementary to the tumor-node-metastasis staging system and facilitated 
patient stratification for personalized therapy.
