AIM: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of uncooled TATO microwave ablation 
(MWA) for primary and metastatic liver cancer.
MATERIALS & METHODS: This was a retrospective study on percutaneous liver 
ablations performed with TATO MWA. Twenty-five ablations were performed; 11 
(44%) were performed for hepatocellular carcinoma, 14 (56%) for colorectal 
carcinoma, gastric and pancreatic metastases.
RESULTS: Adverse events were reported only in one (4%) ablation: an abscess that 
was observed in the ablated area and was resolved with a percutaneous drainage 
and antibiotic therapy. Local tumor control rate was 92% at the 3-month 
follow-up.
CONCLUSION: TATO MWA was safe and effective with high reproducibility in 
treating primary and secondary liver cancer with satisfactory technical and 
clinical outcomes.

Plain Language Summary: The removal of cancer from the liver or liver metastases 
from cancers in distant sites can be performed safely and effectively with a 
system that uses a microwave generator (TATO) that allows a good visibility of 
ablation procedure under intraprocedural real-time ultrasound imaging.
