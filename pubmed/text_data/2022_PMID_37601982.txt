INTRODUCTION: Lenvatinib plus an anti-PD-1 antibody has shown promising 
antitumor effects in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but 
with clinical benefit limited to a subset of patients. We developed and 
validated a radiomic-based model to predict objective response to this 
combination therapy in advanced HCC patients.
METHODS: Patients (N = 170) who received first-line combination therapy with 
lenvatinib plus an anti-PD-1 antibody were retrospectively enrolled from 9 
Chinese centers; 124 and 46 into the training and validation cohorts, 
respectively. Radiomic features were extracted from pretreatment 
contrast-enhanced MRI. After feature selection, clinicopathologic, radiomic, and 
clinicopathologic-radiomic models were built using a neural network. The 
performance of models, incremental predictive value of radiomic features 
compared with clinicopathologic features and relationship between radiomic 
features and survivals were assessed.
RESULTS: The clinicopathologic model modestly predicted objective response with 
an AUC of 0.748 (95% CI: 0.656-0.840) and 0.702 (95% CI: 0.547-0.884) in the 
training and validation cohorts, respectively. The radiomic model predicted 
response with an AUC of 0.886 (95% CI: 0.815-0.957) and 0.820 (95% CI: 
0.648-0.984), respectively, with good calibration and clinical utility. The 
incremental predictive value of radiomic features to clinicopathologic features 
was confirmed with a net reclassification index of 47.9% (p < 0.001) and 41.5% 
(p = 0.025) in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. Furthermore, 
radiomic features were associated with overall survival and progression-free 
survival both in the training and validation cohorts, but modified 
albumin-bilirubin grade and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio were not.
CONCLUSION: Radiomic features extracted from pretreatment MRI can predict 
individualized objective response to combination therapy with lenvatinib plus an 
anti-PD-1 antibody in patients with unresectable or advanced HCC, provide 
incremental predictive value over clinicopathologic features, and are associated 
with overall survival and progression-free survival after initiation of this 
combination regimen.
