BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest 
cancers, with a five-year survival rate of approximately 5%. The incidence and 
mortality rates of PDAC are increasing, and the results of medical treatments 
remain unsatisfactory. Some conflicting evidence suggests that aspirin intake 
may reduce the risk of PDAC. This study aimed to evaluate the association 
between regular low-dose aspirin use (80-mg aspirin tablets, 5-7 tablets/week) 
and the risk of PDAC.
METHODS: This prospective, hospital-based, case-control study was performed on 
470 PDAC patients (case group) and 526 sex and age-matched controls, in Tehran, 
Iran from 2011 to 2018. The participants were interviewed regarding the patterns 
of aspirin use. Data are expressed as mean±SD or frequency and percentage as 
appropriate. Differences in frequency between the case and control groups were 
evaluated based on the analysis of the contingency table (χ2 test and Fisher's 
exact test). Propensity score models were designed to calculate odds ratios (OR) 
and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for PDAC with respect to aspirin use, 
adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, opium use, diabetes mellitus, place of 
residence, and family history of cancer in first-degree relatives.
RESULTS: About 60% of PDAC patients were male in this study. Also, 25.2% of PDAC 
patients had a family history of cancer in one of their first-degree relatives, 
21.99% were smokers, 13.9% were opium users, and 11.7% had a history of 
diabetes. Aspirin was used by 22.77% of PDAC patients and 18.25% of the 
controls. Ever aspirin use (OR: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.89 - 1.14) was not associated 
with PDAC.
CONCLUSION: Overall, aspirin use was not associated with a reduced risk of PDAC.
