Annexin A2 (ANXA2) is a protein that is involved in many physiological and 
pathological cellular processes. There is compelling evidence that its 
dysregulated expression, be it up- or downregulation, contributes to the 
oncogenesis of various neoplasms, including those of the digestive system. The 
present review summarizes the current knowledge on the role of ANXA2 in the main 
tumors of the digestive system. The clinical significance of ANXA2 is 
primordial, due to its potential use as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker, 
and as a part of therapeutic protocols. Certain preclinical studies have shown 
that inhibiting ANXA2 or disrupting its interactions with key molecules can 
suppress tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis, as well as increase the cancer 
cells' sensitivity to treatment in various cancers. Further research is needed 
to fully elucidate the complex role of ANXA2 in the carcinogenesis of tumors of 
the digestive system, and to translate these findings into clinical applications 
for improved diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.
