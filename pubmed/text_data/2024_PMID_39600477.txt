IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis (IgG4-SC) is an inflammatory disease that 
leads to bile duct stricture, characterized by the infiltration of IgG4-positive 
plasma cells into the bile duct wall, thickening of the bile duct wall, and 
narrowing of the lumen. The differential diagnosis of IgG4-SC mainly includes 
primary sclerosing cholangitis, cholangiocarcinoma, and pancreatic cancer. 
IgG4-SC is often associated with autoimmune pancreatitis and can be accurately 
diagnosed based on clinical diagnostic criteria. However, isolated IgG4-SC is 
difficult to distinguish from biliary tumors. Given the significant differences 
in biological behavior, treatment, and prognosis between these diseases, 
accurately identifying isolated IgG4-SC has very important clinical 
significance.
