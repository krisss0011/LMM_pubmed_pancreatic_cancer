A 52-year-old woman underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy after an abnormal 
medical examination, which revealed a mass lesion over half the circumference of 
the superior duodenal angulus. Immunostaining was diffusely positive for 
somatostatin, synaptophysin, and chromogranin A. A 3 cm-sized mass in the 
pancreaticoduodenal region and multiple nodular lesions of a few mm in both 
lobes of the liver were revealed by CT. The diagnosis is primary 
somatostatin-producing tumor of the duodenum with multiple liver metastases. She 
underwent gastric jejunal bypass for impaired transit. Afterwards hepatic 
infusion and systemic chemotherapy were continued, and 5 years passed without 
progression. When she stopped chemotherapy for 6 months, she started 
somatostatin analogue therapy because of the increase of the tumors. The tumors 
did not increase, and 20 years have passed since the start of treatment. We 
report a case of primary somatostatin-producing tumor of the duodenum with liver 
metastases that is still alive for a long period of time, with a review of the 
literature.
