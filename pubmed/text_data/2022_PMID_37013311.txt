Pancreatic gastrointestinal tumour is an unusual primary tumour of the pancreas. 
A 31-year-old male came to the clinic with jaundice and weight loss. 
Cross-sectional imaging showed a mass in the pancreatic uncinate process. 
Image-guided biopsy revealed gastrointestinal stromal tumour, so 
pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed, followed by adjuvant Imatinib. The 
patient had oligo-metastasis in the liver five years post-surgery and underwent 
liver resection. This is an unusual case where a pancreatic GIST presented with 
metastasis while on adjuvant treatment. Hepatectomy and multimodal therapy 
increases the survival if the disease is confined to the liver.
