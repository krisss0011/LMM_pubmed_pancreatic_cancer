Pancreatic and bile duct metastases from esophageal cancer are extremely rare. 
We report a case of advanced esophageal cancer successfully treated with 
chemotherapy, selected on the basis of an accurate pathologic diagnosis. A 
69-year-old man with chronic renal dysfunction presented with persistent 
abdominal pain and anorexia. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed an 
irregular-shaped tumor in the lower esophagus. Computed tomography and 
ultrasonography revealed swollen para-aortic lymph nodes, a pancreatic mass, and 
distal bile duct stenosis. Histopathological examination showed that all of the 
lesions were squamous cell carcinoma with unique immunohistochemical 
characteristics of p40+ and cytokeratin 7+. The final diagnosis was esophageal 
squamous cell carcinoma accompanied by lymph node, pancreas, and bile duct 
metastases. Taking his renal dysfunction into consideration, modified FOLFOX was 
administered as the first-line chemotherapy. The patient survived for 15 months 
since his first presentation. The favorable outcome was attributed to the 
accurate diagnosis based on comprehensive tissue sampling.
