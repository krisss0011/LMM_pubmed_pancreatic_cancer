OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic potential of 
combining clinical features and radiomics with multiple machine learning (ML) 
algorithms in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).
METHODS: A total of 116 patients with PDAC who met the eligibility criteria were 
randomly assigned to a training or validation cohort. Seven ML algorithms, 
including Supervised Principal Components, stepwise Cox, Random Survival Forest, 
CoxBoost, Least absolute shrinkage and selection operation (Lasso), Ridge, and 
Elastic network, were integrated into 43 algorithm combinations. Forty-three 
radiomics models were constructed separately using radiomics features extracted 
from arterial phase (AP), venous phase (VP), and combined arterial and venous 
phase (AP+VP) images. The concordance index (C-index) of each model was 
calculated. The model with the highest mean C-index was identified as the best 
model for calculating the radiomics score (Radscore). Univariate and 
multivariate Cox analyses were used to identify independent prognostic 
indicators and create a clinical model for prognosis prediction. The 
multivariable Cox regression was used to combine Radscore with clinical features 
to create a combined model. The efficacy of the model was evaluated using the 
C-index, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULTS: The model based on the Lasso+StepCox[both] algorithm constructed using 
AP+VP radiomics features showed the best predictive ability among the 114 
radiomics models. The C-indices of the model in the training and validation 
cohorts were 0.742 and 0.722, respectively. Based on the results of the 
univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, sex, Tumor-Node-Metastasis 
(TNM) stage, and systemic inflammation response index were included to build the 
clinical model. The combined model, incorporating three clinical factors and 
AP+VP-Radscore, achieved the highest C-indices of 0.764 and 0.746 in the 
training and validation cohorts, respectively. In terms of preoperative 
prognosis prediction for PDAC, the calibration curve and DCA showed that the 
combined model had a good consistency and greatest net benefit.
CONCLUSION: A combined model of clinical features and AP+VP-Radscore screened 
using multiple ML algorithms has an excellent ability to predict the prognosis 
of PDAC and may provide a noninvasive and effective method for clinical 
decision-making.
