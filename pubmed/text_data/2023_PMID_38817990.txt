There is no consensus on the utility of para-aortic lymph node dissection 
(PALND) in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) for periampullary 
cancer. The objective of this study was to assess survival in patients who 
underwent PD with PALND for pancreatic (PAC) and non-pancreatic (non-PAC) 
adenocarcinoma. All patients who underwent PD and PALND between 2011 and 2019 
were reviewed (n = 114). We looked at the impact of tumor type (PAC versus 
non-PAC) and pathologically confirmed PALN metastasis (PALNM) on overall 
survival (OS). Out of 114 patients, PALNM were pathologically confirmed in 
17(14.9%) patients. Without PALND, pathological staging would be pN0 in1(0.8%), 
pN1 in 3(2.5%), and pN2 in 13(11.2%) patients. The 30-day mortality was 3(2.6%) 
and 65(57%) patients received adjuvant treatment. The 4-year OS for PAC and 
non-PAC was 9% and 39% (P = 0.001). Advanced nodal involvement (pN2) was seen in 
14/17(82.4%) and 21/97(21.6%) patients with and without PALNM, respectively 
(P < 0.001). For PAC, 4-year OS for patients with pN0-N1, pN2, and PALNM was 
12%, 8%, and not reached (P = 0.067). For non-PAC, 4-year OS was 45%, 19%, and 
12% (P = 0.006). In patients with non-PAC, despite metastatic involvement of 
PALN, acceptable long-term survival can be achieved with curative resection. For 
PAC, survival benefit with curative resection remains questionable.
