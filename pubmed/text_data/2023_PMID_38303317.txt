BACKGROUND: In laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy(LPG)with esophago-gastro 
anastomosis, the key of obtaining good surgical view is how to exclude the 
stomach from the supra-pancreatic area.
METHODS: We could get good surgical view at the supra-pancreatic area with 
gastro-ptosis by firstly dissecting lesser curvature. Followed by the 
supra-pancreatic dissection we could efficiently dissect the gastro-splenic 
ligament from cranial side. We performed this procedure in 20 cases with upper 
gastric cancer. We evaluate the surgical outcomes of this procedure(S 
group)comparing to that of the previous procedure in 14 cases(G group).
RESULTS: The median operative time in S group was significantly shorter than 
that in G group (226 min vs 249 min, p=0.02). Other data were similar in 2 
groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The short-term clinical outcomes of LPG with supra-pancreatic 
dissection first approach revealed that this technique is safe and feasible.
