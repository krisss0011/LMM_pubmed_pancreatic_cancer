BACKGROUND: Cancer growth is significantly influenced by processes such as 
pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis that underlie PANoptosis, a 
proinflammatory programmed cell death. Several studies have examined the long 
non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) associated with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD). 
However, the predictive value of lncRNAs related to PANoptosis for PAAD has not 
been established.
METHODS: The Clinical Genome Atlas database was used to obtain the transcriptome 
、clinical data and the corresponding mutation data of the patients with PAAD in 
this study. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression 
analysis was employed to obtain prognosis-related lncRNAs for constructing a 
risk signature. According to the median risk score of the signature, patients 
with PAAD were grouped into low- and high-risk groups to further compare the 
survival prognosis of different risk groups. Time-dependent receiver operating 
characteristic curves, c-index analysis, nomograms, principal component analysis 
and univariate Cox and multivariate Cox regression were performed for the 
internal validation of the signature. In addition, enrichment analysis of 
different genes was performed using gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of 
Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. Lastly, differences in tumor mutation burden 
(TMB), immune function, tumor immune dysfunction and rejection (TIDE), and drug 
response were determined for the two risk groups.
RESULTS: The signature was constructed with six PANoptosis-related lncRNAs 
(AC067817.2、LINC02004、AC243829.1、AC092171.5、AP005233.2、AC004687.1) that 
predicted the prognosis of the patients with PAAD. Survival curves showed that 
patients in the two risk groups had statistically significant differences in 
prognosis (P < 0.05), and multi-cox regression analysis identified risk score as 
an independent risk factor for PAAD prognosis, and internal validation of 
nomograms showed high confidence in the signature. GO and KEGG enrichment 
analysis showed functional and pathway differences between the high- and 
low-risk groups. TMB evaluation demonstrated that patients in the high-risk 
group had a higher frequency of mutations. The TIDE score indicated that the 
high-risk group had a lower risk of immunotherapy escape and better 
immunotherapy outcomes. Additionally, the two risk groups revealed significantly 
different responses to 11 anticancer drugs.
CONCLUSION: We identified a novel risk signature for PANoptosis-related lncRNAs, 
which is a standalone prognostic indicator for PAAD. The PANoptosis-related 
lncRNA risk signature may be relevant for immunotherapy and a therapeutic target 
for PAAD.
