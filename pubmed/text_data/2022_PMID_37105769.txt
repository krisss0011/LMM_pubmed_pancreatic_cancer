A tumor's heterogeneity has important implications in terms of its clonal 
origin, progression, stemness, and drug resistance. Therefore, because of its 
significance in treatment, it is important to understand the gene expression 
pattern of a single cell, track gene expression or mutation in heterogeneous 
cells, evaluate the clonal origin of cancer cells, and determine the selective 
evolution of different subpopulations of cancer cells. Researchers are able to 
trace a cell's mutation and identify different types of tumor cells by measuring 
the whole transcriptome with single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq). This technology 
provides a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving tumor growth 
than that offered by traditional RNA sequencing methods. In addition, it has 
revealed changes in the mutations and functions of somatic cells as a tumor 
evolves; it has also clarified immune cell infiltration and activation. Research 
on scRNA-seq technology has recently advanced significantly, suggesting new 
strategies for the treatment of cancer. In short, cancer researchers have become 
increasingly dependent on scRNA-seq. This paper reviews the development, 
detection principles, and processes of scRNA-seq technology and their 
application in tumor research. It also considers potential clinical 
applications.

Plain Language Summary: Heterogeneity helps us determine the clonal origin, 
progression, and drug resistance of cancer cells.The gene expression pattern of 
a single cell has important biological significance.scRNA-seq enables a better 
understanding of cancer cellsâ€™ molecular mechanisms.scRNA-seq provides 
information about the entirety of a tumor from what we can learn about a single 
cell.
