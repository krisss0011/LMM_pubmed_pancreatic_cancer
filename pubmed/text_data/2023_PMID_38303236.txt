A 58-year-old woman presented with a complaint of weight loss. Abdominal 
computed tomography showed dilatation of the biliary and pancreatic ducts and a 
mural nodule in the pancreatic duct. The diagnosis was intraductal papillary 
mucinous neoplasm(IPMN). Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography(ERCP)and 
cholangioscopy revealed a fistula between the common bile duct and the IPMN. A 
sudden increase in hepatobiliary enzymes was noted preoperatively. ERCP showed 
that the common bile duct was obstructed by mucus. A nasobiliary drainage tube 
was inserted into the bile duct endoscopically and kept open by daily tube 
washing, and the liver dysfunction improved. Total pancreatectomy, splenectomy, 
and regional lymph node dissection were performed. Histological examination 
confirmed that the primary tumor was mixed invasive intraductal papillary 
mucinous adenocarcinoma. The patient remains alive and well with no evidence of 
recurrence 18 months after resection.
