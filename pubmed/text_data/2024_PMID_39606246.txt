The initial stages of acute pancreatitis (AP) are characterized by a significant 
event - acinar ductal metaplasia (ADM). This process is a crucial feature of 
both acute and chronic pancreatitis, serving as the first step in the 
development of pancreatic cancer. Ion channels are integral transmembrane 
proteins that play a pivotal role in numerous biological processes by modulating 
ion flux. In many diseases, the expression and activity of ion channels are 
often dysregulated. Metal ions, including calcium ions (Ca2+), ferrous ions 
(Fe2+), and Copper ions (Cu2+), assume a distinctive role in cellular 
metabolism. These ions possess specific biological properties relevant to 
cellular function. However, the interactions among these ions exacerbate the 
imbalance within the intracellular environment, resulting in cellular damage and 
influencing the progression of AP. A more in-depth investigation into the 
mechanisms by which these ions interact with acinar cells is essential for 
elucidating AP's pathogenesis and identifying novel therapeutic strategies. 
Currently, treatment for AP primarily focuses on pain relief, complications 
prevention, and prognosis improvement. There are limited specific treatments 
targeting acinous cell dedifferentiation or ion imbalance. This study aims to 
investigate potential therapeutic strategies by examining ion crosstalk within 
acinar cells in the context of acute pancreatitis.
