BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is a highly malignant tumor with a rapid 
progression rate and a high susceptibility to infiltration and metastasis. 
Astragalus polysaccharide (APS), a pure Chinese medicine preparation primarily 
made from the traditional Chinese herb Astragalus, plays a positive role in the 
treatment of many malignant tumors.
AIM: To explore the recent efficacy of APS combined with gemcitabine plus 
tegafur gimeracil oteracil potassium capsule (S-1) (GS) regimen in the treatment 
of pancreatic cancer and assess its effect on the immune function and long-term 
survival of patients.
METHODS: A total of 97 patients who were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and 
received GS chemotherapy at The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese 
Medical University (Zhejiang Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine) from March 
2021 to December 2021 were included in the retrospective analysis. Among them, 
41 patients received APS combined with GS chemotherapy, and 56 patients received 
GS chemotherapy only. The recent efficacy, immune function, adverse reactions, 
and long-term survival were compared among these patients.
RESULTS: After 4 cycles of treatment, the objective response rate of patients 
receiving the combined therapy of APS and GS was 51.22%, and the disease control 
rate (DCR) was 56.10%, higher than those of patients receiving the monotherapy 
with GS alone (30.36% and 35.71%, respectively). Besides, the percentages of 
CD3+ T cells (50.18% ± 9.57%) and CD4+ T cells (31.52% ± 5.33%) in the 
peripheral blood of patients receiving the combined therapy of APS and GS were 
higher compared with those treated with GS regimen alone [(44.06% ± 8.55%) and 
(26.01% ± 7.83%), respectively]. Additionally, the incidences of leukopenia, 
thrombocytopenia, and fatigue in patients receiving the combined therapy of APS 
and GS were significantly lower than those in patients receiving the monotherapy 
of GS alone (17.07%, 9.76%, 31.71% vs 37.50%, 28.57%, 60.71%). Moreover, the 
median survival time of patients receiving the combined therapy of APS and GS 
was 394 days, significantly longer than that of patients receiving the 
monotherapy of GS alone (339 days) (hazard ratio: 0.66; 95%CI: 0.45-0.99; P = 
0.036). All these differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The combined therapy of APS and GS improved the recent efficacy and 
long-term survival of patients with pancreatic cancer and alleviated 
chemotherapy-induced immune suppression and adverse reactions.
