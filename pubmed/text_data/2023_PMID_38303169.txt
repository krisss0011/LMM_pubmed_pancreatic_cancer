A case is a female of 61-year-old. She visited her local doctor with a chief 
complaint of frequent burping. She was hospitalized for gastric cancer with 
pyloric stenosis. Although open gastrectomy was planned the gastric cancer was 
unresectable due to pancreatic invasion and peritoneal dissemination. Cytology 
with abdominal lavage was CY0. She underwent gastrojejunostomy. She was treated 
by 19 courses of chemotherapy with SOX therapy for 2 years. The tumor reduced, 
and she underwent distal gastrectomy as conversion surgery. Pathological 
findings were por2>muc>tub2>tub1, ypT2(ypMP), INF c, int, Ly1a, V0, pPM0, pDM0, 
pN0(0/43), ypStage ⅠB, R0, Grade 2b. Adjuvant chemotherapy(S-1 and docetaxel)was 
administered after conversion surgery. She is alive without recurrence for 1 
year and 6 months after gastrectomy. We report a case of Stage Ⅳ gastric cancer 
treated with conversion surgery after chemotherapy.
