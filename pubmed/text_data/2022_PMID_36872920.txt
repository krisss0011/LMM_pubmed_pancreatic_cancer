INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to compare the prognostic impact of laparoscopic 
left hepatectomy (LLH) with that of open left hepatectomy (OLH) on patient 
survival after resection of left hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
METHODS: Among the 953 patients who received initial treatment for primary HCC 
that was resectable by either LLH or OLH from 2013 to 2017 in Japan and Korea, 
146 patients underwent LLH and 807 underwent OLH. The inverse probability of 
treatment weighting approach based on propensity scoring was used to address the 
potential selection bias inherent in the recurrence and survival outcomes 
between the LLH and OLH groups.
RESULTS: The occurrence rate of postoperative complications and hepatic 
decompensation was significantly lower in the LLH group than in the OLH group. 
Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was better in the LLH group than in the OLH group 
(hazard ratio, 1.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.71; p = 0.029), whereas 
overall survival (OS) was not significantly different. Subgroup analyses of RFS 
and OS revealed an almost consistent trend in favor of LLH over OLH. In patients 
with tumor sizes of ≥4.0 cm or those with single tumors, both RFS and OS were 
significantly better in the LLH group than in the OLH group.
CONCLUSIONS: LLH decreases the risk of tumor recurrence and improves OS in 
patients with primary HCC located in the left liver.
