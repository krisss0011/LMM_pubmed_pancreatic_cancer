Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks as the fourth most common cause of 
mortality globally among all cancer types. Programmed cell death (PCD) is a 
crucial biological mechanism governing cancer progression, tumor expansion, and 
metastatic dissemination. Furthermore, the tumor microenvironment (TME) is 
critical in influencing overall survival (OS) and immune responses to 
immunotherapeutic interventions. From a multi-omics perspective, the combination 
of PCD and TME could help to predict the survival of HCC patient survival and 
immunotherapy response. Our study analyzed variations in the PCD- and 
TME-classifier used in the classification of HCC patients into two subgroups: 
PCD high-TME low and PCD low-TME high. In the following step, we compared the 
tumor somatic mutation (TMB), immunotherapy response, and functional annotation 
of both groups of patients. Lastly, Western Blot (WB) were conducted. The 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on the Human Protein Atlas (HPA). In 
the PCD-TME classifier, 23 PCD-related genes and three immune cell types were 
identified. Patients' prognoses and responses to therapy could be accurately 
predicted using this model. The findings of this study provide a new instrument 
for the clinical management of HCC patients, and they contribute to the 
development of accurate treatment strategies for these patients.
