Gemcitabine is a cytotoxic drug commonly used in the treatment of several types 
of cancer. While gemcitabine is generally considered safe and effective, it can 
cause some side effects, including pulmonary toxicity. Interstitial lung disease 
is a rare but potentially serious event. We report a case of a 63-year-old 
patient with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. She received Gemcitabine 
1000 mg/m2 on day 1, and day 8, and presented on day 15 of the first cycle with 
respiratory distress rapidly aggravating. Clinical and radiological findings 
were concordant with interstitial lung disease. Management consisted of high 
doses of corticosteroids and oxygen therapy. There was no clinical improvement 
and the patient passed away after a few days. Despite its low incidence, 
gemcitabine-induced interstitial lung disease may be responsible for a fatal 
clinical picture. Clinicians must be aware of this possibility and address 
respiratory symptoms as soon as possible.
