A 69-year-old man with dysphagia was diagnosed with advanced esophageal cancer 
by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. He had undergone pancreatic tail and 
partial transverse colon resection for pancreatic cancer, and right hilar lymph 
node biopsy and partial lower lobe resection for the diagnosis of pulmonary 
sarcoidosis. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography(CT)scan showed no change over 
time in lymph node enlargement in the mediastinum, so metastasis of esophageal 
cancer was considered to be negative. Therefore, the diagnosis of advanced 
esophageal cancer, Mt, type 2, T2N0M0, cStage â…¡, was made, and surgery was 
performed after 2 courses of DCF therapy. Because of the adhesions in the 
thoracic cavity and possible problems with elevation of the gastric tube and 
blood flow due to resection of the pancreatic tail, it was decided to perform 
two-stage operation. Although imaging studies over time, as in the present case, 
can help in the diagnosis, it is difficult to distinguish whether enlarged lymph 
nodes are reactive changes or metastases. In this study, we experienced a case 
of thoracic esophageal cancer complicated by sarcoidosis with enlarged 
mediastinal lymph nodes.
