Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a devastating disease with poor 
survival rates. Here, we evaluated iron-doped hydroxyapatite (FeHA) as a 
potential nanomedicine-based approach to combat PDAC. FeHA, in combination with 
a sublethal dose of the glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) inhibitor RSL3, was 
found to trigger ferroptosis in KRAS mutant PANC-1 cells, but not in BxPC3 
cells, while sparing normal human cells (fibroblasts and peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells). These findings were recapitulated in 3D spheroids generated 
using PDAC cells harboring wild-type versus mutant KRAS. Moreover, ferroptosis 
induction by FeHA plus RSL3 was reversed by the knockdown of STEAP3, a 
metalloreductase responsible for converting Fe3+ to Fe2+. Taken together, our 
data show that FeHA is capable of triggering cancer cell death in a 
KRAS-selective, STEAP3-dependent manner in PDAC cells.
