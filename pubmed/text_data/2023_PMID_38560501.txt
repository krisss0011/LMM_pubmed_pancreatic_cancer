CYP3A5 is a cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme that metabolizes drugs and contributes 
to drug resistance in cancer. However, it remains unclear whether CYP3A5 
directly influences cancer progression. In this report, we demonstrate that 
CYP3A5 regulates glucose metabolism in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. 
Multi-omics analysis showed that CYP3A5 knockdown results in a decrease in 
various glucose-related metabolites through its effect on glucose transport. A 
mechanistic study revealed that CYP3A5 enriches the glucose transporter GLUT1 at 
the plasma membrane by restricting the translation of TXNIP, a negative 
regulator of GLUT1. Notably, CYP3A5-generated reactive oxygen species were 
proved to be responsible for attenuating the AKT-4EBP1-TXNIP signaling pathway. 
CYP3A5 contributes to cell migration by maintaining high glucose uptake in 
pancreatic cancer. Taken together, our results, for the first time, reveal a 
role of CYP3A5 in glucose metabolism in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and 
identify a novel mechanism that is a potential therapeutic target.
