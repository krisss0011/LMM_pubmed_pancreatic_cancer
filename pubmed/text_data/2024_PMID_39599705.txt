BACKGROUND: High-fat diets (HFDs) have been associated with an increased risk of 
pancreatic cancer. In contrast, ketogenic diets (KDs) have been shown to display 
anti-tumor characteristics. The objective of this work was to evaluate the 
efficacy of a KD on late-stage pancreatic carcinogenesis in a genetically 
modified mouse model of pancreatic cancer [LSL-KrasG12D/+; Ptf1-Cre (KC) mice], 
as well as its liver safety, and to compare it to that of an HFD.
METHODS: Six-month-old female and male KC mice were randomly allocated to either 
a control diet (CD) (%kcal: 20% fat, 15% protein, 65% carbohydrates), an HFD 
(%kcal: 40% fat, 15% protein, 45% carbohydrate) or a KD (%kcal: 84% fat, 15% 
protein, 1% carbohydrate) and fed these diets for 6 months.
RESULTS: HFD-fed, but not KD-fed, mice showed a 15% increase in body weight, 
plus elevated serum insulin (2.4-fold increase) and leptin (2.9-fold increase) 
levels, compared to CD-fed mice. At the pancreas level, no differences in 
pancreatic cancer incidence rates were observed among the diet groups. Regarding 
the liver safety profile, the HFD-fed mice had higher serum levels of alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline 
phosphatase (ALP), when compared to the CD and KD groups. In addition, upon 
histologic examination, an HFD, but not a KD, showed a ~2-fold increase in both 
macro- and microsteatosis, as well as 35% and 32% higher levels of TLR4 and 
NF-ÎºB activation, respectively, compared to CD-fed mice.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, although a KD intervention alone did not prevent 
pancreatic carcinogenesis, our data suggests that a KD modulates insulin 
signaling and hepatic lipid metabolism, highlighting its beneficial effects on 
healthspan and liver function when compared to an HFD.
