Pancreatic cancer, one of the most aggressive malignancies, has no effective 
treatment due to the lack of targets and drugs related to tumour metastasis. 
SIRT6 can promote the migration of pancreatic cancer and could be a potential 
target for antimetastasis of pancreatic cancer. However, highly selective and 
potency SIRT6 inhibitor that can be used in vivo is yet to be discovered. Here, 
we developed a novel SIRT6 allosteric inhibitor, compound 11e, with maximal 
inhibitory potency and an IC50 value of 0.98 ± 0.13 μmol/L. Moreover, compound 
11e exhibited significant selectivity against other histone deacetylases 
(HADC1‒11 and SIRT1‒3) at concentrations up to 100 μmol/L. The allosteric site 
and the molecular mechanism of inhibition were extensively elucidated by 
cocrystal complex structure and dynamic structural analyses. Importantly, we 
confirmed the antimetastatic function of such inhibitors in four pancreatic 
cancer cell lines as well as in two mouse models of pancreatic cancer liver 
metastasis. To our knowledge, this is the first study to reveal the in vivo 
effects of SIRT6 inhibitors on liver metastatic pancreatic cancer. It not only 
provides a promising lead compound for subsequent inhibitor development 
targeting SIRT6 but also provides a potential approach to address the challenge 
of metastasis in pancreatic cancer.
