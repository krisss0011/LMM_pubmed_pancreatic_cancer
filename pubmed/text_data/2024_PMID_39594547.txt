Glutathione peroxidases (GPxs) are a family of enzymes that play a critical role 
in cellular redox homeostasis through the reduction of lipid hydroperoxides to 
alcohols, using glutathione as a substrate. Among them, GPx4 is particularly of 
interest in the regulation of ferroptosis, a form of iron-dependent programmed 
cell death driven by the accumulation of lipid peroxides in the endoplasmic 
reticulum, mitochondria, and plasma membrane. Ferroptosis has emerged as a 
crucial pathway in the context of cancer, particularly pancreatic cancer, which 
is notoriously resistant to conventional therapies. GPx4 acts as a key inhibitor 
of ferroptosis by detoxifying lipid peroxides, thereby preventing cell death. 
However, this protective mechanism also enables cancer cells to survive under 
oxidative stress, which makes GPx4 a potential druggable target in cancer 
therapy. The inhibition of GPx4 can trigger ferroptosis selectively in cancer 
cells, especially in those that rely heavily on this pathway for survival, such 
as pancreatic cancer cells. Consequently, targeting GPx4 and other GPX family 
members offers a promising therapeutic strategy to sensitize pancreatic cancer 
cells to ferroptosis, potentially overcoming resistance to current treatments 
and improving patient outcomes. Current research is focusing on the development 
of small-molecule inhibitors of GPx4 as potential candidates for pancreatic 
cancer treatment.
