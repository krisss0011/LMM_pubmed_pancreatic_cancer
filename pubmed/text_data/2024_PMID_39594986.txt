BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN) are heterogeneous 
entities. Despite considerable advancement in the field, almost 50% of patients 
have metastatic disease, when liver transplantation (LT) is one of the possible 
treatments offering a cure in well-selected patients.
METHODS: The present study aims to systematically review all the literature from 
2000 onwards on using LT for patients with NEN-LM, with particular attention to 
the risk factors of death and recurrence.
RESULTS: LT offers 5-year OS ranging from 52 to 74% and 5-year TFS rates ranging 
from 39 to 62%, with even better results published from 2009 onwards. The main 
risk factors for patient deaths are related to unfavorable primary tumor 
pathology, higher liver involvement, and simultaneous LT and primary resection. 
Similarly, recurrence is higher related to poor tumor grade and differentiation, 
and in the case of an older recipient age.
CONCLUSIONS: Applying uniform criteria and a more in-depth understanding of the 
relevant prognostic factors contribute to a better selection of candidates for 
curative LT due to NEN metastases. LT for unresectable or liver-restricted NENs 
has a relevant place in the treatment algorithm and has achieved excellent 
results in recent decades, but more international efforts are needed to further 
improve outcomes.
