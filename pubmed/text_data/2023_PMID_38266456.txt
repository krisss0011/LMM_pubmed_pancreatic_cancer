BACKGROUND: The DIAPHs (DIAPH1, DIAPH2, and DIAPH3) are members of the 
diaphanous subfamily of the formin family. KIF20B and MET, hub genes of DIAPHs, 
play crucial roles in cytoskeletal remodeling, cell migration, and adhesion. 
However, their combined prognostic and treatment value in pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma (PC) warrants further investigation.
METHODS: Multiomics analysis tools were used to comprehensively assess the 
genomic expression and prognostic value of KIF20B and MET in PC. Immune cell 
infiltration, functional enrichment, single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA) analysis, 
potential therapeutic drugs, and nomograms were established and analyzed. CCK-8 
levels, transwell assay, Co-IP assay, mass spectrometry, and western blotting 
were performed to assess the role of KIF20B and MET as modulators of β-catenin 
and Lactate Dehydrogenase A (LDHA) in vitro. Xenograft tumor models were used to 
evaluate the anti-tumor effects in vivo.
RESULTS: DIAPHs, KIF20B, and MET were overexpressed and functioned as poor 
prognostic markers of PC. Immunoinfiltration analysis revealed that pDC and NK 
cells were enriched with low expression levels of KIF20B and MET, whereas Th2 
cells were enriched with high expression levels of these two genes. The copy 
number variations (CNVs) in KIF20B and MET were positively correlated with B 
cell and CD4 + T cell infiltration. Immunological checkpoints NT5E and CD44 were 
positively correlated with KIF20B and MET expression. Moreover, the nomogram 
constructed based on KIF20B and MET demonstrated predictive value for overall 
survival. scRNA-Seq analysis indicated that KIF20B and MET were enriched in 
endothelial, malignant, B, T, and CD8 + T cells, which correlated with 
glycolysis and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The interactions of 
KIF20B and MET with β-catenin and LDHA were verified by Co-IP assay and mass 
spectrometry. Knockdown of KIF20B and MET downregulates β-catenin and LDHA in 
vitro. Furthermore, dual knockdown of KIF20B and MET exhibited a synergistic 
suppressive effect on PC progression in vitro and in vivo.
CONCLUSION: DIAPHs, KIF20B, and MET are promising candidates for the prognosis 
and treatment of PC. More importantly, downregulation of KIF20B and MET 
inhibited pancreatic cancer progression by regulating LDHA and EMT.
