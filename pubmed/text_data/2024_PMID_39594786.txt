Carcinoid syndrome (CS) is a rare condition associated with neuroendocrine 
tumors (NETs), particularly those originating in the gastrointestinal tract, 
which secrete bioactive substances like serotonin. The management of CS requires 
a multidisciplinary approach due to its complex clinical manifestations, 
including flushing, diarrhea, bronchospasm, and carcinoid heart disease. Optimal 
care involves collaboration between several professional figures like 
oncologists, endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, surgeons, and dietitians. 
Currently, a wide range of treatments are available, focused on both symptom 
control and tumor burden reduction. Somatostatin analogs (SSAs) are the 
first-line therapy for symptom relief. Still, in patients with progressive 
disease or refractory CS, other options include targeted therapies, peptide 
receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), liver-directed therapies, and surgical 
resection, when feasible. Furthermore, management of complications related to 
prolonged serotonin release and malnutrition as a result of exocrine pancreatic 
insufficiency, post-surgical conditions, vitamin deficit, and chronic diarrhea 
often requires early detection to mitigate symptoms and improve the quality of 
life in these patients. The complexity of CS necessitates individualized care 
and continuous coordination among specialists to optimize outcomes and enhance 
patient well-being.
