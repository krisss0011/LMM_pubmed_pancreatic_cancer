OBJECTIVES: The aims of this review were to determine whether positive 
peritoneal lavage cytology (CY+) precludes radical resection in pancreatic 
cancer and to propose prospections for future studies.
METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central were searched for related 
articles. Dichotomous variables and survival outcomes were analyzed with the 
estimation of odds ratio and hazards ratio (HR), respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 4905 patients were included, of which 7.8% were CY+. 
Positive peritoneal lavage cytology was correlated with poor overall survival 
(univariate survival analysis [HR, 2.35; P < 0.00001]; multivariate analysis 
[HR, 1.62; P < 0.00001]), poor recurrence-free survival (univariate survival 
analysis [HR, 2.50; P < 0.00001]; multivariate analysis [HR, 1.84; P < 
0.00001]), and higher initial peritoneal recurrence rate (odds ratio, 5.49; P < 
0.00001).
CONCLUSIONS: Although CY+ predicts poor prognosis and a higher risk of 
peritoneal metastasis after curative resection, it is not sufficient to preclude 
curative resection based on the current evidence, and high-quality trials should 
be conducted to assess the prognostic impact of operation among resectable CY+ 
patients. In addition, more sensitive and accurate methods to detect peritoneal 
exfoliated tumor cells and more effective comprehensive treatment for resectable 
CY+ pancreatic cancer patients are clearly warranted.
