OBJECTIVES: The management of incidentally discovered pancreatic cystic lesions 
(PCLs) with surveillance or resection often requires shared decision-making. 
Patients with cirrhosis are more likely to have PCLs discovered due to increased 
imaging, and those undergoing liver transplantations (LTs) may be at increased 
risk of carcinogenesis due to immunosuppressive medications. Our study aimed to 
characterize the outcomes and risk of malignant progression of PCLs in post-LT 
patients.
METHODS: Multiple databases were searched for studies looking at PCLs in post-LT 
patients from inception until February 2022. Primary outcomes were the incidence 
of PCLs in LT recipients and progression to malignancy. Secondary outcomes 
included development of worrisome features, outcomes of surgical resection for 
progression, and change in size.
RESULTS: A total of 12 studies with 17,862 patients with 1411 PCLs were 
included. The pooled proportion of new PCL development in post-LT patients was 
68% (95% confidence interval [CI], 42-86; I2 = 94%) over the follow-up of 3.7 
(standard deviation, 1.5) years. The pooled progression of malignancy and 
worrisome features was 1% (95% CI, 0-2; I2 = 0%) and 4% (95% CI, 1-11; I2 = 
89%), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with nontransplant patients, incidental PCLs do not carry 
a higher risk of malignancy.
