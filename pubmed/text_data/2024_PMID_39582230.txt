BACKGROUND: Knowledge of determinants of aggressive end-of-life care is crucial 
to organizing effective palliative care for patients with gastrointestinal (GI) 
cancer.
PURPOSE: This study aims to investigate the determinants of aggressive 
end-of-life care in patients with GI cancer.
METHODS: A national register-based cohort study using data from the Danish 
Register on Causes of Death, the Danish National Patient Register, and the 
Danish Palliative Database was the method of study employed.
PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: All Danish patients who died from GI cancers from 2010 to 
2020 comprised the study setting.
RESULTS: There were 43,969 patients with GI cancers in the cohort, of whom 62% 
were hospitalized in the last 30 days of life, 41% of patients died in the 
hospital, 10% had surgery, 39% were subjected to a radiological examination 
during the last 30 days of life and 3% had antineoplastic treatment during the 
last 14 days of life. Among all types of GI cancers, pancreatic cancer was 
significantly associated with all outcomes of aggressive end-of-life care except 
surgery. Patients in specialized palliative care (SPC) had lower odds of 
receiving aggressive end-of-life care and dying in the hospital. We found that 
patients with comorbidity and those who were divorced had higher odds of being 
hospitalized at the end of life and dying in the hospital.
INTERPRETATION: Aggressive end-of-life care is associated with disease factors 
and socio-demographics. The potential to reduce aggressive end-of-life care is 
considerable in patients with GI cancer, as demonstrated by the impact of SPC. 
However, we need to address the needs of patients with GI cancer who do not 
receive SPC.
