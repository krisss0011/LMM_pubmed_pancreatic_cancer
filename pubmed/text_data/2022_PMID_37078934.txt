OBJECTIVES: To analyze whether use of proton pump inhibitors increase the risk 
for pancreatic cancer in a mouse model and human clinical cohorts.
METHODS: p48-Cre/LSL-KrasG12D mice that develop precancerous pancreatic 
intraepithelial neoplasia (PanINs) were treated with low- or high-dose proton 
pump inhibitors (PPIs) orally for 1 and 4 months. The mechanism for the 
cholecystokinin receptor 2 (CCK-2R) activation was investigated in vitro. Two 
resources were employed to analyze the risk of pancreatic cancer in human 
subjects with PPI use.
RESULTS: Serum gastrin levels were increased 8-fold (P < 0.0001) in mice treated 
with chronic high-dose PPIs, and this change correlated with an increase (P = 
0.02) in PanIN grade and the development of microinvasive cancer. The CCK-2R 
expression was regulated by microRNA-148a in the p48-Cre/LSL-KrasG12D mice 
pancreas and in human pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. Proton pump inhibitor 
consumption in human subjects was correlated with pancreatic cancer risk (odds 
ratio, 1.54). A validation analysis conducted using the large-scale United 
Kingdom Biobank database confirmed the correlation (odds ratio, 1.9; P = 
0.00761) of pancreatic cancer risk with PPI exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: This investigation revealed in both murine models and human 
subjects, PPI use is correlated with a risk for development of pancreatic 
cancer.
