Background: Sarcopenia is a muscle disease that occur across a lifetime. It is 
commonly described in the aging population but can occur earlier in life in 
patients with cancer. Previous studies demonstrated sarcopenia is highly 
prevalent in patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours 
(GEP-NETs). In solid organ cancers, such as colorectal or pancreatic cancer, the 
presence of sarcopenia is associated with surgical complications. It is unknown 
if sarcopenia in patients with GEP-NETs is a risk factor for surgical 
complications. Methods: A multicentre retrospective study was performed in 
patients with a recently diagnosed GEP-NET and surgery to the primary tumour. CT 
scans were analysed for body composition analyses to assess for the presence of 
sarcopenia. Data regarding surgical procedures and complications were collected. 
Any major surgical complication was considered as Clavien-Dindo score â‰¥ 3. 
Results: This study included 180 patients, with 83 being male (46%) with a 
median age of 62 years (IQR 54-69). Most patients (n = 138, 77%) had a small 
intestinal NET, while 36 patients (20%) had pancreatic NETs. Sarcopenia was 
present in 109 patients (61%). In 43 patients (24%), surgical complications were 
recorded, and 21 complications (49%) were considered as major. Any type of 
surgical complication was not statistically different between patients without 
sarcopenia (n = 17, 24%) and with sarcopenia (n = 26, 24%)-a p-value of 0.36. 
This was the same for major complications; between patients without sarcopenia 
(n = 5, 24%) and with sarcopenia (n = 16, 76%)-a p-value of 0.18. Conclusions: 
Sarcopenia is highly prevalent in patients with a recently diagnosed GEP-NET, 
but this is not associated with major surgical complications. Future studies 
should include pathophysiological mechanisms that could be used to identify the 
causes of sarcopenia, its effect on quality of life and other oncological 
outcomes.
