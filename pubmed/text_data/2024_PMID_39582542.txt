PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to compare mean platelet volume/platelet count 
ratio (PVPR) and other indicators' predictive abilities. Simultaneously, a new 
nomogram for predicting recurrence-free survival (RFS) after gastrointestinal 
stromal tumors (GISTs) R0 resection was developed.
METHODS: From January 2010 to July 2019, 295 patients with GIST who were 
operated on at Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital were retrospectively 
reviewed. With a 4-year RFS as the end point, using the Kaplan-Meier methods and 
log rank test, and then conducting Cox regression analysis, we compared and 
identified meaningful indicators for predicting prognosis. Finally, a nomogram 
was developed and validated using calibration curves.
RESULTS: The receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that a cutoff 
point of 0.044 was the ideal threshold for PVPR, and patients were divided into 
a high-PVPR group (≤0.044) and a low-PVPR group (>0.044). Kaplan-Meier curves 
suggested that PVPR>0.044 had obvious associations with better RFS (p < 0.001). 
In accordance with multivariate analysis, PVPR (>0.044 vs. ≤0.044) (p = 0.005), 
National Institutes of Health (NIH) risk category (p < 0.001), and Ki-67 (p = 
0.005) were the independent prognostic indicators of RFS. Tumor size, 
gastrointestinal bleeding, mitotic index, NIH risk category, CD34, and Ki-67 all 
exhibited an obvious correlation with PVPR (all p < 0.05). The nomogram's 
probability of concordance was 0.823, indicating that the nomogram predictions 
were well calibrated.
CONCLUSION: In GISTs, RFS can be independently predicted by PVPR. Patients with 
higher PVPR have better RFS. The nomogram including PVPR could be used to assist 
clinical treatment decision-making.
