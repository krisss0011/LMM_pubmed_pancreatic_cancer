Lipid-formulated RNA vaccines have been widely used for disease prevention and 
treatment, yet their mechanism of action and individual components contributing 
to such actions remain to be delineated. Here, we show that a therapeutic cancer 
vaccine composed of a protamine/mRNA core and a lipid shell is highly potent in 
promoting cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses and mediating anti-tumor immunity. 
Mechanistically, both the mRNA core and lipid shell are needed to fully 
stimulate the expression of type I interferons and inflammatory cytokines in 
dendritic cells. Stimulation of interferon-β expression is exclusively dependent 
on STING, and antitumor activity from the mRNA vaccine is significantly 
compromised in mice with a defective Sting gene. Thus, the mRNA vaccine elicits 
STING-dependent antitumor immunity.
