The immune system is an interacting network of plentiful molecules that could 
better characterize the relationship between immunity and cancer. This study 
aims to investigate the behavioral patterns of immune-related interaction 
perturbation networks in glioblastoma. An immune-related 
interaction-perturbation framework was introduced to characterize four 
heterogeneous subtypes using RNA-seq data of TCGA/CGGA glioblastoma tissues and 
GTEx normal brain tissues. The stability and robustness of the four subtypes 
were validated in public datasets and our in-house cohort. In the four subtypes, 
C1 was an inflammatory subtype with high immune infiltration, low tumor purity, 
and potential response to immunotherapy; C2, an invasive subtype, was featured 
with dismal prognosis, telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter mutations, 
moderate levels of immunity, and stromal constituents, as well as sensitivity to 
receptor tyrosine kinase signaling inhibitors; C3 was a proliferative subtype 
with high tumor purity, immune-desert microenvironment, sensitivity to 
phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase signaling inhibitor and DNA replication 
inhibitors, and potential resistance to immunotherapy; C4, a synaptogenesis 
subtype with the best prognosis, exhibited high synaptogenesis-related gene 
expression, prevalent isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations, and potential 
sensitivity to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Overall, this study provided an 
attractive platform from the perspective of immune-related interaction 
perturbation networks, which might advance the tailored management of 
glioblastoma.
