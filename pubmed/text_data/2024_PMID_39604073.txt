BACKGROUND: Cancer cachexia can impact prognosis, cause resistance to anticancer 
treatments and affect the tolerability of treatments. This study aims to 
identify hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with cachexia by characterizing 
longitudinal body composition (BC) trajectories.
METHODS: This longitudinal, multicentre cohort study included unresectable HCC 
patients treated with first-line programmed death-(ligand)1 inhibitors plus 
anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibody/tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
between 01/2018-12/2022. BC measurements including skeletal muscle mass (SMM) 
and total adipose tissue area (TATA) were evaluated by computed tomography at 
the third lumbar vertebra at baseline and follow-up imaging. Unsupervised latent 
class growth mixed models were applied to distinguish potential longitudinal SMM 
and TATA trajectories for identifying cachexia. The primary study endpoint was 
overall survival (OS), with secondary endpoints including progression-free 
survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR) and safety. Multiple Cox 
proportional hazards models were used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) 
for survival.
RESULTS: A total of 411 patients with 2138 time-point measurements were 
included. The median age was 56 years, and 50 (12.2%) patients were female. Two 
distinct trajectories were identified for SMM and TATA: sharp-falling and 
stable. SMM sharply declined in 58 patients (14.1%) and TATA in 71 of 406 
patients (17.5%) with significant worse OS (for SMM, 17.0 vs. 24.9 months; 
p < 0.001; HR = 0.59; for TATA, 15.3 vs. 25.1 months; p < 0.001; HR = 0.44). 
Patients were categorized into three phases based on trajectories: pre-cachexia 
(SMM and TATA stable, n = 299, 73.6%), cachexia (SMM or TATA sharp-falling, 
n = 86, 21.2%) and refractory cachexia (SMM and TATA sharp-falling, n = 21, 
5.2%). Patients with refractory cachexia exhibited the worst OS, PFS and ORR, 
followed by those with cachexia. The median OS was 11.5 months for refractory 
cachexia, 17.7 for cachexia and 26.0 for pre-cachexia; median PFS was 6.0, 7.9 
and 10.9 months, respectively, with ORR of 4.8%, 39.5% and 54.2%, respectively 
(all ps < 0.001). Multivariable Cox analysis identified refractory cachexia as 
an independent risk factor for both OS (HR = 3.31; p < 0.001) and PFS 
(HR = 2.94; p < 0.001), with cachexia also showing significant impacts. Grade 
3-4 adverse events were higher in patients with refractory cachexia (23.8%) and 
cachexia (8.1%) compared with pre-cachexia (6.0%; p = 0.010).
CONCLUSIONS: HCC patients with cachexia and refractory cachexia were identified 
by longitudinal BC trajectories. Falling trajectories of BC identified 
refractory cachexia patients with worst response, survival and poor tolerability 
from systemic therapy combinations.
