Immunotoxin has become a highly promising therapy for treating cancer and has 
achieved good results in preclinical trials targeting various cancers. However, 
there are still some issues that limit the development and application of 
immunotoxins, such as short half-life and toxic side effects on healthy tissues. 
In this study, we designed a tumor-conditional immunotoxin called 
NbHSA-uPA-A1-PE24. Anti-HSA nanobody (NbHSA) was fused to the N-terminus of 
A1-PE24 (immunotoxin targeting mesothelin) via a linker cleavable by 
tumor-associated proteases, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). NbHSA 
binds to HSA (human serum albumin) in the blood circulation, which not only 
prolongs the half-life of immunotoxins, but also creates a certain spatial 
barrier between A1 and mesothelin, thereby reducing the toxicity of 
NbHSA-uPA-A1-PE24 to healthy tissues expressing mesothelin. Moreover, uPA 
cleavable element rendered the immunotoxin conditional activation specifically 
in tumor microenvironment. In animal experiments, the half-life of the newly 
designed immunotoxins was increased dramatically. Noted, NbHSA-uPA-A1-PE24 has 
better enrichment at tumor, and shows robust anti-tumor effects in multiple 
preclinical models, such as pancreatic cancer and gastric cancer models. The 
results indicate that this strategy has greater potential and higher safety for 
application in tumor treatment, providing new ideas and strategies for the 
development of immunotoxins for cancer patients.
