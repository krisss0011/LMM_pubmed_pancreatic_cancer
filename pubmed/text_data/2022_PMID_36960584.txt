The following is a technical report of the successful cryoablation of pancreatic 
metastasis originating from follicular thyroid carcinoma. The patient was a 
72-year-old female who underwent total thyroidectomy and radioiodine ablation 
for follicular carcinoma. One year after surgery, a positron emission 
tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) examination, performed to demonstrate 
the source of the increased thyroglobulin, showed a fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) 
avid mass located in the body of the pancreas. A percutaneous tru-cut biopsy was 
performed that revealed follicular thyroid carcinoma metastasis to the pancreas. 
Because of the patient's comorbidities, the patient underwent percutaneous 
cryoablation and made a successful recovery over the following 13 months. At the 
most recent follow-up, the thyroglobulin level was undetectable, and a PET-CT 
scan showed no FDG avid mass in the pancreas. To our knowledge, follicular 
carcinoma metastasis of the pancreas is extremely rare, and this is the first 
report of successful cryoablation of a metastatic tumor in the pancreas.
