Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is one of the most aggressive forms of 
breast cancer, lacking common treatment targets such as estrogen (ER), 
progesterone (PR), and HER2 receptors. This subtype is associated with 
significant heterogeneity, chemoresistance, early recurrence, metastasis, and 
poor patient survival. FOXM1 is a cancer-promoting transcription factor that 
plays a critical role in TNBC and other highly aggressive cancers by driving 
cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance. In TNBC, 
mutations in the TP53 gene-detected in approximately 80% of patients-lead to the 
overexpression of FOXM1, making it a promising therapeutic target. Beyond TNBC, 
FOXM1 is implicated in other solid cancers, such as brain (glioblastoma), lung, 
and pancreatic cancers, and is considered an Achilles' heel of aggressive 
cancers. Despite its potential as a therapeutic target, there are currently no 
FDA-approved FOXM1 inhibitors, and none have advanced to clinical trials. This 
review explores the role of FOXM1 in cancer progression and highlights the 
current status of efforts to develop effective FOXM1 inhibitors.
