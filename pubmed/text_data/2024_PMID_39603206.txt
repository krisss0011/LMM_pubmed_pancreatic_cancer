While poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) have 
achieved specific clinical benefits in a subset of pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients, the potential role of the PARPi niraparib in 
PDAC necessitates further exploration. In this study, we demonstrated that 
Niraparib exhibited a pronounced inhibitory effect on autophagy in PDAC both in 
vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, this inhibition was primarily attributed to 
niraparib's ability to disrupt the fusion process between autophagosomes and 
lysosomes, while potentially exerting a relatively minor impact on the initial 
stage of autophagy. The blockade effect observed may be mediated via modulation 
of the ERK signaling pathway, and this effect can be mitigated by the 
application of an ERK inhibitor (FR180204). Notably, the combined treatment 
regimen of niraparib and gemcitabine failed to elicit the anticipated 
synergistic effects in wild-type PANC-1 cells, instead exhibiting pronounced 
antagonistic interactions. However, in gemcitabine-resistant PANC-1 cells, the 
combination of niraparib and gemcitabine exhibited modest additive effects. 
Furthermore, niraparib demonstrated a heightened cytotoxic potency against 
gemcitabine-resistant PANC-1 cells compared to wild-type PANC-1 cells, both in 
vitro and in vivo. Our research established that niraparib inhibits late-stage 
autophagy in PDAC, potentially representing a valuable salvage therapy for 
gemcitabine-resistant PDAC. Further clinical studies are justified.
