A 72-year-old woman presented with obstructive jaundice. Computed tomography 
revealed a 12-mm low-density mass in the head of the pancreas. She was diagnosed 
as having pancreatic cancer by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle 
aspiration. She received gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel as preoperative 
chemotherapy. After 2 courses, hepatoduodenal lymph node metastasis appeared and 
was accompanied by increased tumor marker levels. The regimen was changed to 
modified FOLFIRINOX. After 5 courses, the lymph node metastasis was reduced in 
size and the tumor marker levels were decreased, so subtotal stomach-preserving 
pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed. Adjuvant chemotherapy was administered 
postoperatively. The patient was alive and well without recurrence 2 years and 9 
months after the surgery, but died of sepsis. Nevertheless, this case highlights 
that when preoperative chemotherapy for resectable pancreatic cancer appears to 
be ineffective, a change in regimen may be useful.
