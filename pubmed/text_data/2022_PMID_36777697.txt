INTRODUCTION: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is one of the most aggressive 
malignancies in humans. The main reason for its unfavourable prognosis is the 
combination of rapid tumour growth, early-onset metastasis and currently still 
inadequate diagnostic and therapeutic options. Thus, only very few patients are 
eligible for radical resection of the primary tumour as the only curative 
treatment option available so far. In the perioperative period, tumour 
progression and metastasis are facilitated by the activation of key signalling 
pathways and the altered regulation of transcription factors. Various tumour 
entities have shown increased expression of the integrin-3 receptor subunit, 
which correlates with more rapid tumour progression and metastasis through 
advanced migration, invasion and proliferation. The influence of perioperative 
medication and postoperative pain management remains unclear. To investigate the 
effects of ketamine, s-ketamine and MK 801 on integrin beta-3-mediated cell 
migration in pancreatic cancer cells in vitro.
METHODS: The effects of ketamine, s-ketamine and MK 801 on integrin beta-3 
expression were investigated with immunoblot. Cell migratory potentials were 
analysed using a Cell Migration Assay Kit with a Boyden chamber, in which cells 
migrate through a semipermeable membrane under different stimuli.
RESULTS: Stimulation with ketamine and MK 801 significantly promoted migration 
in pancreatic cancer cells, increasing the expression of integrin beta-3.
CONCLUSION: Novel therapeutic approaches target the effective modulation of 
specific signalling and transcription pathways. The prerequisite for such 
'target therapies' is comprehensive knowledge about the respective 
carcinogenesis. Further studies are required to identify the underlying disease 
mechanisms of pancreatic carcinoma.
