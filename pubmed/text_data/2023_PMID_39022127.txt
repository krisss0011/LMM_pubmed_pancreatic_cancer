Aging is a contributor to liver disease. Hence, the concept of liver aging has 
become prominent and has attracted considerable interest, but its underlying 
mechanism remains poorly understood. In our study, the internal mechanism of 
liver aging was explored via multi-omics analysis and molecular experiments to 
support future targeted therapy. An aged rat liver model was established with 
d-galactose, and two other senescent hepatocyte models were established by 
treating HepG2 cells with d-galactose and H2O2. We then performed transcriptomic 
and metabolomic assays of the aged liver model and transcriptome analyses of the 
senescent hepatocyte models. In livers, genes related to peroxisomes, fatty acid 
elongation, and fatty acid degradation exhibited down-regulated expression with 
aging, and the hepatokine Fgf21 expression was positively correlated with the 
down-regulation of these genes. In senescent hepatocytes, similar to the results 
found in aged livers, FGF21 expression was also decreased. Moreover, the 
expressions of cell cycle-related genes were significantly down-regulated, and 
the down-regulated gene E2F8 was the key cell cycle-regulating transcription 
factor. We then validated that FGF21 overexpression can protect against liver 
aging and that FGF21 can attenuate the declines in the antioxidant and 
regenerative capacities in the aging liver. We successfully validated the 
results from cellular and animal experiments using human liver and blood 
samples. Our study indicated that FGF21 is an important target for inhibiting 
liver aging and suggested that pharmacological prevention of the reduction in 
FGF21 expression due to aging may be used to treat liver aging-related diseases.
