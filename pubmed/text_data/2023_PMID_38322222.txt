BACKGROUND: Hepatectomy is the preferred treatment for solitary hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) without macrovascular invasion and distant metastasis, but 
long-term survival remains unsatisfactory in certain patients. We sought to 
identify whether the grading severity of microscopic vascular invasion (MVI) was 
associated with recurrence and survival among patients with solitary HCC.
METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent hepatectomy for solitary HCC were 
identified from a multicenter prospectively-collected database. Patients were 
categorized into three groups according to the MVI grading system proposed by 
the Liver Cancer Pathology Group of China: M0 (no MVI), M1 (1-5 sites of MVI 
occurring ≤1.0 cm away from the tumor), and M2 (>5 sites occurring ≤1.0 cm or 
any site occurring >1 cm away from the tumor). Recurrence-free survival (RFS) 
and overall survival (OS) were compared among the groups.
RESULTS: Among 227 patients, 97 (42.7%), 83 (36.6%), and 47 (20.7%) patients had 
M0, M1, and M2, respectively. Median RFS rates among patients with M0, M1, and 
M2 were 38.3, 35.1, 11.6 months, respectively, while OS rates were 66.8, 62.3, 
30.6 months, respectively (both P<0.001). Multivariate Cox-regression analyses 
demonstrated that both M1 and M2 were independent risk factors for RFS (hazard 
ratio 1.20, 95% CI: 1.03-1.89, P=0.040; and hazard ratio 1.67, 95% CI: 
1.06-2.64, P=0.027) and OS (hazard ratio 1.28, 95% CI: 1.05-2.07, P=0.035; and 
hazard ratio 1.97, 95% CI: 1.15-3.38, P=0.013).
CONCLUSIONS: Grading severity of MVI was independently associated with RFS and 
OS after hepatectomy for solitary HCC. Enhanced surveillance for recurrence and 
potentially adjuvant therapy may be considered for patients with MVI, especially 
individuals with more severe MVI grading (M2).
