BACKGROUND: The feasibility and safety of laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy 
(LPD) in overweight patients is still controversial. This study was designed to 
analyze the impact of overweight on surgical outcomes in patients undergoing 
LPD.
METHODS: Data from patients who underwent LPD between January 2018 and July 2022 
were analyzed retrospectively. A 1:1 propensity score-matching (PSM) analysis 
was performed to minimize bias between groups.
RESULTS: A total of 432 patients were enrolled, with a normal weight group 
(n = 241) and an overweight group (n = 191). After matching, 144 patients were 
enrolled in each group. The results showed that the incidence of clinically 
relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (CR-POPF) and delayed gastric emptying 
(DGE) was significantly higher in the overweight group compared to the normal 
weight group (P = 0.036). However, there were no significant differences in 
perioperative mortality (1.4% vs. 2.1%, P = 0.652) and long-term survival 
outcomes between malignancy patients with different body mass index (BMI) before 
and after PSM (all P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: It is safe and feasible for overweight patients to undergo LPD with 
mortality and long-term survival outcomes comparable to the normal weight group. 
High-quality prospective randomized controlled trials are still needed.
