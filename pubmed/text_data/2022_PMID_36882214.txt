OBJECTIVE: Intercellular communication within pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 
(PDAC) dramatically contributes to metastatic processes. The underlying 
mechanisms are poorly understood, resulting in a lack of targeted therapy to 
counteract stromal-induced cancer cell aggressiveness. Here, we investigated 
whether ion channels, which remain understudied in cancer biology, contribute to 
intercellular communication in PDAC.
DESIGN: We evaluated the effects of conditioned media from patient-derived 
cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) on electrical features of pancreatic cancer 
cells (PCC). The molecular mechanisms were deciphered using a combination of 
electrophysiology, bioinformatics, molecular and biochemistry techniques in cell 
lines and human samples. An orthotropic mouse model where CAF and PCC were 
co-injected was used to evaluate tumour growth and metastasis dissemination. 
Pharmacological studies were carried out in the Pdx1-Cre, Ink4afl/fl 
LSL-KrasG12D (KICpdx1) mouse model.
RESULTS: We report that the K+ channel SK2 expressed in PCC is stimulated by 
CAF-secreted cues (8.84 vs 2.49 pA/pF) promoting the phosphorylation of the 
channel through an integrin-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-AKT (Protein 
kinase B) axis. SK2 stimulation sets a positive feedback on the signalling 
pathway, increasing invasiveness in vitro (threefold) and metastasis formation 
in vivo. The CAF-dependent formation of the signalling hub associating SK2 and 
AKT requires the sigma-1 receptor chaperone. The pharmacological targeting of 
Sig-1R abolished CAF-induced activation of SK2, reduced tumour progression and 
extended the overall survival in mice (11.7 weeks vs 9.5 weeks).
CONCLUSION: We establish a new paradigm in which an ion channel shifts the 
activation level of a signalling pathway in response to stromal cues, opening a 
new therapeutic window targeting the formation of ion channel-dependent 
signalling hubs.
