A 73-year-old, male patient presented with the chief complaint of epigastric 
pain and received the diagnosis of extensive cholangiocarcinoma after a close 
examination. Extensive extension of the malignancy into the right and left 
hepatic ducts precluded a curative resection, and the patient received GC 
therapy. After 11 courses of GC over about 1 year, no new lesions or tumor 
progression was observed, and a bile duct mapping biopsy was performed to 
investigate the possibility of resection conversion. The results showed a marked 
decrease in atypia, and reactive atypia was diagnosed. A pancreaticoduodenectomy 
was performed, and histopathologically negative margins were obtained. The 
response to treatment was Grade â…¡a according to the Evans classification. At 23 
months after the start of treatment and 12 months after surgery, the patient is 
recurrence-free without adjuvant chemotherapy. Although the evidence for 
conversion surgery for biliary tract cancer has not been established, the 
long-term outcomes may be favorable.
