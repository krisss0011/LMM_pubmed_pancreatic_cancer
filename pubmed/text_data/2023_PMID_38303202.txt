A 73-year-old woman underwent left nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma(RCC). 
The computed tomography(CT)and magnetic resonance imaging(MRI)revealed a 20-mm 
tumor in the pancreatic tale showing early enhancement in the arterial phase 16 
years after surgery. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission 
tomography(FDG-PET)showed slightly uptake (maximum standard uptake value: SUVmax 
2.3)and EUS-FNA showed a hyper-vascularized tumor in the pancreatic tail. A 
single pancreatic metastasis from RCC was diagnosed, and we performed distal 
pancreatectomy. The histopathological diagnosis was a metastatic pancreatic 
tumor from RCC. The postoperative course was uneventful and 1 month after 
surgery, she is alive with no recurrence.
