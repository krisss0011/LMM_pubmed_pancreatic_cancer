BACKGROUND: Early screening of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is strongly 
recommended for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected patients. We aimed to develop 
and validate a predictive nomogram based on HCC occurrence trajectory for 
screening precancerous patients with HCC.
METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) samples from 22 patients with 
HCC with their precancerous stage (n = 55) and 18 healthy controls were measured 
using HumanMethylation EPIC BeadChip assay. HCC trajectory was assessed by 
pseudotime based on TimeAx algorithm and chronological time. The 43 candidate 
CpG sites were selected from the methylation signature and measured using 
multiplex bisulfite sequencing in a retrospective cohort of HBV-infected 
patients (n = 604). A 5-CpG-classifier was built using the LASSO Cox regression 
model, based on the association between the methylation level of every CpG and 
the duration from enrollment to HCC occurrence of individual patient. We 
validated the risk stratification and predictive accuracy of this classifier in 
both the primary cohort (n = 300) and independent validation cohort (n = 304).
RESULTS: Pseudotime and chronological time of HCC trajectory analysis revealed 
that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway underwent changes in the precancerous stage. Based 
on the trajectory of methylation signature, we built a 5-CpG-classifier which 
remained powerful and independent predictive efficiency after stratified 
analysis by clinicopathological risk factors in both primary cohort and 
independent validation cohort. A predicting nomogram including the 
5-CpG-classifier was constructed after multivariate analysis. One-year 
cumulative hazard of HCC in low- and high-risk groups of HBV-infected patients 
was 3.0% (0.1%-5.8%) and 17.90% (11.00%-24.3%) (P < .0001) in primary cohort, 
4.5% (1.20%-7.80%) and 27.3 (18.90-34.90) (P < .0001) in the independent 
validation cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: One-year before HCC was a critical period of transitional time when 
parts of the methylation profile underwent shifting toward HCC like. The 
nomogram could identify precancerous stage patients with HCC who should be 
screened for early diagnosis and intervention.
