SUBJECTS: We first reviewed surgical outcomes and pathological findings of 32 
patients(laparoscopic group: LDP n=11, open group: ODP n=21)who underwent distal 
pancreatectomy for pancreatic cancer from January 2018 to October 2022. Then we 
reviewed long-term outcomes, and recurrence type for 20 patients(LDP: n=5, ODP: 
n=15)from January 2018 to February 2021.
RESULTS: LDP group had significantly longer operation time and less blood loss. 
There was no difference in length of hospital stay, postoperative complications, 
number of dissected lymph nodes, positive lymph node metastasis rate, and 
adjuvant chemotherapy rate. Because of high rate of pancreatic stump closure by 
hand sewing in ODP, postoperative pancreatic fistula rate was higher in ODP than 
in LDP. The 2-year relapse-free survival rate was 60% in LDP, 33% in ODP, and 
the 2-year overall survival rate was 60% in LDP, 71% in ODP, and there were no 
significant differences. As for the type of recurrence, in LDP group, 2 cases of 
distant metastases and no local recurrence was observed, and in ODP group, 6 
cases each of local recurrences and distant metastases were observed.
CONCLUSION: LDP was not inferior to ODP in short and long- term outcomes, 
safety, curability, and local control ability.
