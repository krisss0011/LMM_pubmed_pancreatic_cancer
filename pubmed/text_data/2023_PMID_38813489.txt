Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are noncoding RNA molecules with a heterogeneous 
structure consisting of 200 or more nucleotides. Because these noncoding RNAs 
are transcribed by RNA polymerase II, they have properties similar to messenger 
RNA (mRNA). Contrary to popular belief, the term "ncRNA" originated before the 
discovery of microRNAs. LncRNA genes are more numerous than protein-coding 
genes. They are the focus of current molecular research because of their pivotal 
roles in cancer-related processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, 
and migration. The incidence of pancreatic cancer (PC) is increasing around the 
world and research on the molecular aspects of PC are growing. In this review, 
it is aimed to provide critical information about lncRNAs in PC, including the 
biological and oncological behaviors of lncRNAs in PC and their potential 
application in therapeutic strategies and as diagnostic tumor markers.
