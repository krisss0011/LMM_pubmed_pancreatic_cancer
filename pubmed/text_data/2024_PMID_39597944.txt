BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the 
deadliest cancers. Surgical resection is the most reliable chance for cure, but 
high rates of positive margins and local failure persist. Neoadjuvant therapies 
(NAT), including chemotherapy and radiation therapy (RT), are being explored to 
improve surgical outcomes, particularly in borderline resectable (BRPC) and 
locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). This review aims to summarize the 
current landscape and future directions for neoadjuvant RT (NART) in PDAC.
METHODS: The review includes a detailed analysis of past and ongoing clinical 
trials investigating various NART approaches in PDAC, with an emphasis on 
different RT techniques, fractionation schemes, and their integration into 
multimodal treatment strategies.
RESULTS: Early evidence suggests that NART can improve resection margins and 
local control. However, recent trials, including the Alliance A021501 and LAP-07 
trials, have failed to demonstrate significant survival benefits with the 
addition of RT to NAT. Nevertheless, nuances in trial design and execution 
continue to keep the question of NART open. Newer approaches, such as 
stereotactic magnetic resonance-guided adaptive radiation therapy (SMART), show 
promise in improving local control and survival, but further phase 3 trials are 
needed.
CONCLUSIONS: While NART has shown potential in improving local control in PDAC, 
its impact on overall survival remains unclear. Ongoing trials, particularly 
those utilizing advanced techniques like SMART, are critical in defining the 
role of RT in the neoadjuvant setting for PDAC. Collaboration across 
multidisciplinary teams is essential to optimize treatment strategies and trial 
outcomes.
