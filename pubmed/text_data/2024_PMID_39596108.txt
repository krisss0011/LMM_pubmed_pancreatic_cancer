Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal cancers, primarily due to its 
late diagnosis and limited treatment options. This review examines the 
challenges and potential of using immunotherapy to treat pancreatic cancer, 
highlighting the role of artificial intelligence (AI) as a promising tool to 
enhance early detection and monitor the effectiveness of these therapies. By 
synthesizing recent advancements and identifying gaps in the current research, 
this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of how AI and immunotherapy 
can be integrated to develop more personalized and effective treatment 
strategies. The insights from this review may guide future research efforts and 
contribute to improving patient outcomes in pancreatic cancer management.
