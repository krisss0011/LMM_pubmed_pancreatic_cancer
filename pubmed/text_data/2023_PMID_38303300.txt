Bulky N+ gastric cancer has a poor prognosis. The results of JCOG0405 showed the 
efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 plus cisplatin combination therapy 
for Bulky N+ gastric cancer. JLSSG0901 demonstrated the safety and efficacy of 
laparoscopic surgery for advanced gastric cancer. But the safety of laparoscopic 
surgery for locally advanced and extensive nodal metastasis cancer(T4b, 
para-aortic lymph node metastasis)is not apparent. After DOS therapy, we 
performed total laparoscopic gastrectomy, DP(distal pancreatectomy), D2+ 
#16a2/b1 lat, and Roux-en-Y reconstruction, and histopathological results showed 
that the aortic lymph node metastasis disappeared. We controlled extensive lymph 
node metastasis using preoperative triplet chemotherapy. Laparoscopic surgery 
after preoperative chemotherapy for Bulky N+ gastric cancer can be a treatment 
option because we performed laparoscopic resection and para-aortic lymph node 
dissection with no complications, including pancreatic complications.
