Cell cytoskeleton proteins are involved in tumor pathogenesis, progression and 
pharmacological resistance. Filamin A (FLNA) is a large actin-binding protein 
with both structural and scaffold functions implicated in a variety of cellular 
processes, including migration, cell adhesion, differentiation, proliferation 
and transcription. The role of FLNA in cancers has been studied in multiple 
types of tumors. FLNA plays a dual role in tumors, depending on its subcellular 
localization, post-translational modification (as phosphorylation at Ser2125) 
and interaction with binding partners. This review summarizes the experimental 
evidence showing the critical involvement of FLNA in the complex biology of 
endocrine tumors. Particularly, the role of FLNA in regulating expression and 
signaling of the main pharmacological targets in pituitary neuroendocrine 
tumors, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors and 
adrenocortical carcinomas, with implications on responsiveness to currently used 
drugs in the treatment of these tumors, will be discussed.
