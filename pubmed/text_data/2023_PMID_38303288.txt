The patient described herein was diagnosed with left breast, endometrial, and 
early gastric cancers at 49, 53, and 57 years of age, respectively. Magnetic 
resonance cholangiopancreatography performed when she was undergoing treatment 
for cholecystitis at 50 years of age showed local pancreatic duct dilatation in 
the pancreatic head. She was followed in the Department of Gastroenterology at 
our hospital for an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm(IPMN). An abdominal 
computed tomography scan obtained at 59 years of age revealed dilation of the 
main pancreatic duct in the pancreas body and tail, therefore an endoscopic 
ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration was performed. She was diagnosed with 
pancreatic cancer and underwent a laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy. The 
postoperative course was uneventful; however, the pancreatic cancer recurred and 
she died approximately 14 months postoperatively. Reports of multiple cancers 
associated with IPMNs are rare, yet we managed a patient with a pancreatic head 
IPMN complicated by metachronous quadruple carcinomas( breast, endometrial, 
gastric, and pancreatic cancers).
