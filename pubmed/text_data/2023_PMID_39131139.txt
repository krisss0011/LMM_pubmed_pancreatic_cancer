BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy causes numerous 
immune-related adverse events, including autoimmune pancreatic injury (AIPI), 
which results in rapid organ atrophy. We profiled the clinico-radiological 
features, short-term natural history, and response to steroids of AIPI.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 229/11,165 (2.1%) adult 
patients with AIPI. One hundred and ten out of 229 (48%) had abdominal 
computerized tomography (CT) scan at lipase elevation; data of 110 without 
pancreatic metastases were analyzed. We analyzed serial CT-based pancreas 
volumetry data in 48 patients with AIPI (32 with normal CT and 16 with 
pancreatitis on CT at lipase elevation). We examined impact of steroids on pain 
and disease course.
RESULTS: In AIPI (n = 229), median lipase elevation was 4x upper limit of normal 
(range: 3-40x). The injury was more often asymptomatic than painful (143/229 
(62%) vs 86/229 (38%), P < .000). Majority (83/110 (75%) had normal CT, often in 
painless vs painful disease: 51/57 (90%) vs 32/53 (60%), P < .001) 25% had 
interstitial pancreatitis. On serial pancreas volumetry, marked volume (cc) loss 
occurred 1 year after vs 3 months before lipase elevation in both normal CT 
(median 81.6 vs 61.3, P = .00) and pancreatitis on CT groups (91.8 vs 60.5, P = 
.00), ≥20% volume loss occurred in 47% vs 73%, respectively (P = .08). Steroids, 
when used did not mitigate pain, biochemical relapse, pancreas volume loss or 
1-year diabetes incidence (7.2%).
CONCLUSION: Autoimmune pancreatic injury (AIPI) is uniquely characterized by 
painless lipase elevation, normal pancreas on CT and rapid pancreatic volume 
loss on follow-up. Steroids do not appear to have a role in management.
