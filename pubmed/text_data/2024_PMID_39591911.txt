BACKGROUND: Lactylation plays an essential role in pancreatic cancer, but the 
precise role of lactylated histone in the diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatic 
cancer remains to be further clarified.
METHODS: Twenty-one patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer were enrolled in 
this study, and the clinicopathologic characteristics were collected. 
Lactylation levels of total proteins and histone H3 Lysine-18 (H3K18) of tissues 
were determined by western blotting and laboratory indicators including serum 
levels of lactate, Cancer Antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), and Carcinoembryogenic Antigen 
(CEA) were obtained.
RESULTS: Total protein lactylation was found in both pancreatic cancer tissues 
and para-carcinoma normal tissues, and was more potent in tumor tissues. H3K18la 
was also highly expressed tumor tissues. Furthermore, H3K18la protein expression 
correlated positively with serum lactate (r = 0.774, p < 0.001), CA19-9 (r = 
0.744, p < 0.001), and CEA (r = 0.589, p < 0.01). The Area Under the Curve (AUC) 
of H3K18la for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer was 0.848 in serum (p < 
0.001).
CONCLUSION: The present findings suggested that H3K18 may be used as a novel 
potential biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatic cancer 
patients.
