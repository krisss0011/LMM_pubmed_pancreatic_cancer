A new prenylated indole diketopiperazine alkaloid, rubrumline P (1), was 
isolated along with six more analogues and characterized from the fermentation 
culture of a marine sediment-derived fungus, Aspergillus chevalieri, collected 
at a depth of 15 m near the lighthouse in Dahab, Red Sea, Egypt. In the current 
study, a bioassay-guided fractionation allowed for the identification of an 
active fraction displaying significant cytotoxic activity against the human 
pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line PANC-1 from the EtOAc extract of the 
investigated fungus compared to the standard paclitaxel. The structures of the 
isolated compounds from the active fraction were established using 1D/2D NMR 
spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, together with comparisons with the 
literature. The absolute configuration of the obtained indole diketopiperazines 
was established based on single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses of rubrumline 
I (2) and comparisons of optical rotations and NMR data, as well as on 
biogenetic considerations. Genome sequencing indicated the formation of 
prenyltransferases, which was subsequently confirmed by the isolation of mono-, 
di-, tri-, and tetraprenylated compounds. Compounds rubrumline P (1) and 
neoechinulin D (4) confirmed preferential cytotoxic activity against PANC-1 
cancer cells with IC50 values of 25.8 and 23.4 µM, respectively. Although the 
underlying mechanism-of-action remains elusive in this study, cell cycle 
analysis indicated a slight increase in the sub-G1 peak after treatment with 
compounds 1 and 4.
