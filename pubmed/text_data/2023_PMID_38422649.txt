BACKGROUND: Safer and more effective drugs are needed for the treatment of acute 
pancreatitis (AP). Qingjie Huagong decoction (QJHGD) has been applied to treat 
AP for many years and has shown good clinical effects. However, the potential 
mechanism has not yet been determined.
PURPOSE: To investigate the role and underlying mechanism of the effects of 
QJHGD on AP both in vitro and in vivo.
METHODS: QJHGD was characterized by UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS. The protective effect 
of QJHDG and the underlying mechanism were investigated in MPC-83 cells in 
vitro. A caerulein-induced AP model was established to evaluate the protective 
effect of QJHGD in mice. CCK-8 assays were used to detect cell viability. The 
contents of inflammatory mediators were determined by ELISA. Expression levels 
of circRNA, miRNA and mRNA were determined by qRT-PCR. Protein expression was 
determined using Western blot. Pancreatic tissues were assessed by hematoxylin 
and eosin staining as well as immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence 
analyses. Pull-down and luciferase activity assays were performed to determine 
the regulatory relationships of circHipk3, miR-193a-5p and NLRP3.
RESULTS: Our results confirmed that mmu-miR-193a-5p was sponged by 
mmu-circHipk3, and NLRP3 was a target of miR-193a-5p. In vitro experiments 
showed that QJHGD enhanced MPC-83 cell viability by regulating circHipk3 
sponging mir-193a-5 targeting NLRP3 and inhibiting pyroptosis-related factors. 
Finally, we showed that QJHGD ameliorated pancreatic tissue injury in AP mice 
via this pathway.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrate that QJHDG exerted its anti-AP effects via 
the circHipk3/miR-193a-5p/NLRP3 pathway, revealing a novel mechanism for the 
therapeutic effect of QJHDG on AP.
