The outcome of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) patients is poor, given 
resistance to gemcitabine. Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) has been implicated in 
the carcinogenesis of pancreatic cancer; however, its function and mechanism in 
PAAD resistance to gemcitabine (GEM) are yet unknown. Herein, we demonstrate 
that lncRNA DSCR9 is significantly reduced in PAAD in vitro and in vivo. CCK-8, 
BrdU and flow cytometry assays show that overexpression of DSCR9 markedly 
suppresses pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and invasion, and promotes 
apoptosis under gemcitabine treatment. BTG2 acts as a tumor suppressor by 
reducing the proliferation and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells and 
increasing gemcitabine-induced apoptosis. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining 
combined with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of pancreatic cancer 
tissues shows that DSCR9 and BTG2 are both increased in pancreatic cancer 
tissues. Luciferase assay shows that miR-21-5p simultaneously binds to DSCR9 and 
3'UTR of BTG2; DSCR9 relieves miR-21-5p-induced inhibition of BTG2 by competing 
with BTG2 for miR-21-5p binding. Overexpression of miR-21-5p enhances the 
invasiveness of pancreatic cancer cells by promoting cancer cell proliferation 
and invasion and attenuating gemcitabine-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of 
miR-21-5p attenuates the effect of DSCR9 overexpression on BTG2 expression and 
invasiveness of pancreatic cancer cells. Finally, miR-21-5p expression is 
increased, while BTG2 expression is decreased in pancreatic cancer tissues. 
miR-21-5p is negatively correlated with DSCR9 and BTG2. In conclusion, the 
DSCR9/miR-21-5p/BTG2 axis modulates pancreatic cancer proliferation, invasion, 
and gemcitabine resistance.
