Herein, we report a case of pancreatic cancer with acute cholangitis secondary 
to biliary obstruction. Empirical antibiotic therapy did not change the clinical 
presentation. Blood cultures were sterile; however, bile culture was positive 
for yeasts. Our laboratory analysis revealed a biliary coinfection by 
multidrug-resistant C. glabrata and C. albicans. The patient was successfully 
treated with endoscopic biliary drainage.
