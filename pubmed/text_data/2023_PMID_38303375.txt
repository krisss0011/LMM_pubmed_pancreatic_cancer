As medical insurance coverage for robotic surgery has been expanded in the field 
of gastrointestinal surgery in Japan, the number of cases undergoing robotic 
surgery for hepato-biliary-pancreatic disease has been increasing. Therefore, 
cases with malignant tumors and metastatic lesions tend to undergo robotic 
operation for both primary tumors and metastases. Herein, we report a case of 
neuroendocrine tumor(NET)in the pancreatic tail with simultaneous single liver 
metastasis, which was treated with two-stage robotic-assisted surgery. A 
67-year-old female underwent a computed tomography scan and a hypovascularized 
tumor in the pancreatic tail region and liver was found. A biopsy of the 
pancreatic tumor by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration 
demonstrated a NET G1-2. The liver lesion was diagnosed as a metastatic tumor, 
considering the other examinations. The patient underwent a robotic distal 
pancreatectomy(RDP)and was histopathologically diagnosed as NET G2. Sixty-three 
days after the RDP, a two-stage partial liver resection for the metastatic tumor 
was performed under robotic assistance. Curative resection was achieved through 
two-stage robot-assisted surgery, there were no postoperative complications.
