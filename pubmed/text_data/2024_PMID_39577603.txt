Chromosomal Instability (CIN) encompasses approximately 65 %-70 % of colorectal 
cancer (CRC) patients, playing a pivotal role in tumor progression. However, 
controversies persist regarding the molecular characteristics and treatment 
strategies associated with these patients. Integrative colorectal cancer 
proteogenomic analysis identified DDX18 in colorectal cancer. We investigated 
the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of colorectal cancer by the 
R-loop binding protein DDX18 using colon cancer tissues, cell lines and 
patient-derived organoids. Our findings revealed that DDX18 expression 
positively correlates with the expression of genomic instability marker R-loops. 
Moreover, heightened DDX18 expression delays the completion of DNA damage 
repair, leading to an increase in double-strand DNA breaks, thereby promoting 
genomic instability. Notably, the upregulation of DDX18 enhances sensitivity to 
DNA-damaging. This study elucidated DDX18 beyond participating in fundamental 
physiological functions, may play a crucial role in the regulation of genomic 
stability, and also provides a powerful resource for further functional 
exploration of DDX18 in cancer progression and therapeutic application.
