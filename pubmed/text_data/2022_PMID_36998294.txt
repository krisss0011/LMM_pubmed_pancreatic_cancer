AIM: This study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of a multidisciplinary 
approach incorporating neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with S1 (S1-NACRT) for 
resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
METHODS: The medical records of 132 patients who received S1-NACRT for 
resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma from 2010 to 2019 were reviewed. The 
S1-NACRT regimen consisted of S1 at a dose of 80-120 mg/body/day together with 
1.8 Gy of radiation in 28 fractions. The patients were re-evaluated 4 weeks 
after S1-NACRT completion, and a pancreatectomy was then considered.
RESULTS: Adverse events of S1-NACRT ≥grade 3 occurred in 22.7% of the patients, 
and 1.5% discontinued therapy. Of the 112 patients who underwent a 
pancreatectomy, 109 underwent R0 resection. Adjuvant chemotherapy with relative 
dose intensity ≥50% was administered to 74.1% of the patients who underwent 
resection. The median overall survival of all patients was 47 months, and the 
median overall survival and recurrence-free survival of patients who underwent 
resection was 71 and 32 months, respectively. According to the multivariate 
analyses of prognostic factors for overall survival in patients who underwent 
resection, negative margin status (hazard ratio: 0.182; P = 0.006) and relative 
dose intensity of adjuvant chemotherapy ≥50% (hazard ratio 0.294; P < 0.001) 
were independent prognostic factors of overall survival.
CONCLUSIONS: A multidisciplinary approach incorporating S1-NACRT for resectable 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma demonstrated acceptable tolerability and good 
local control and resulted in comparable survival benefits.
