BACKGROUND: The appropriate extent of resection for esophagogastric junction 
cancer and the method of surgical approach remain controversial. This study 
aimed to assess the safety and outcomes of the parachute technique, which is an 
open transhiatal reconstruction method that facilitates stable reconstruction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The surgical outcomes of 20 consecutive patients who 
underwent open lower- esophagogastrectomy for EGJ cancer at Kitasato University 
Hospital from June 2019 to July 2023 were retrospectively reviewed.
SURGICAL PROCEDURE (PARACHUTE TECHNIQUE): The esophagus was transected, and a 
purse-string suture was placed at the stump. Then, a fixing string was placed. 
Hence, the mucosa, muscular layer, and adventitia, including the string of the 
purse-string suture, were not displaced. By placing approximately 10 stay 
sutures around the whole esophageal stump, the esophageal stump can be opened to 
the maximum diameter. Then, insert the anvil head into the esophagus lumen while 
laying it sideways, and it can be put on smoothly without stress.
RESULTS: In total, there were 17 and 3, male and female patients, respectively. 
The median esophageal invasion length was 12.5 (0-30) mm. One patient presented 
with cStage I EGJ cancer, four with cStage II, 14 with cStage III, and one with 
cStage IV. In terms of postoperative complications, three (15%) patients 
developed grade II intra-abdominal fluid correction according to the 
Clavien-Dindo classification. However, none of the patients presented with 
anastomotic leakage.
CONCLUSIONS: The parachute technique can be a safe and effective reconstruction 
technique as it does not cause anastomotic leakage.
