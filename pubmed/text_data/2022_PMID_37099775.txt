OBJECTIVES: Given the complex surgical management and infrequency of pancreatic 
neuroendocrine tumor, we hypothesized that treatment at a center of excellence 
improves survival.
METHODS: Retrospective review identified 354 patients with pancreatic 
neuroendocrine tumor treated between 2010 and 2018. Four hepatopancreatobiliary 
centers of excellence were created from 21 hospitals throughout Northern 
California. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. The χ2 test of 
clinicopathologic factors determined which were predictive for overall survival 
(OS).
RESULTS: Localized disease was seen in 51% of patients, and metastatic disease 
was seen in 32% of patients with mean OS of 93 and 37 months, respectively (P < 
0.001). On multivariate survival analysis, stage, tumor location, and surgical 
resection were significant for OS (P < 0.001). All stage OS for patients treated 
at designated centers was 80 and 60 months for noncenters (P < 0.001). Surgery 
was more common across stages at the centers of excellence versus noncenters at 
70% and 40%, respectively (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are indolent but have malignant 
potential at any size with management often requiring complex surgeries. We 
showed survival was improved for patients treated at a center of excellence, 
where surgery was more frequently utilized.
