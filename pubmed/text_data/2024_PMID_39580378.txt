BACKGROUND: Colorectal liver metastasis (CLM) is classified into technical and 
oncologic categories, with recommended treatments for each resectability 
category. However, the classification of recurrent CLM has not been established 
to date.
METHODS: This study evaluated patients with CLM who underwent initial liver 
resection between 2006 and 2020 and subsequently experienced liver recurrence. 
Long-term outcomes and prognostic factors associated with recurrent CLM were 
investigated.
RESULTS: From 949 patients who underwent an initial liver resection, the 
analysis included 392 patients with liver recurrence. Repeat liver resection was 
associated with a significantly longer prognosis than non-resection (5-year 
overall survival [OS] from initial liver resection: 66.3 % vs 27.2 %, p < 
0.0001). Multivariable analysis indicated the following independent prognostic 
factors: four or more recurrent tumors (p = 0.015), tumor 5 cm or larger in size 
(p = 0.004), and presence of extrahepatic diseases (p = 0.003). The patients 
were stratified into resectable, borderline resectable, and unresectable 
recurrent CLM groups based on these criteria. The prognosis varied significantly 
across the groups, with 5-year OS rates of 67.3 % for resectable recurrent CLM, 
30.8 % for borderline resectable recurrent CLM, and 2.6 % for unresectable 
recurrent CLM (p < 0.0001). Patients with borderline resectable recurrent CLM 
who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy after initial liver resection had a 
positive prognostic impact of preoperative chemotherapy (p = 0.049).
CONCLUSION: The significant independent predictors of recurrent CLM prognosis 
were four or more tumors, tumor size of 5 cm or larger, and the presence of 
extrahepatic diseases at recurrence. It is critical to onsider the current 
condition and tumor resectability at the time of recurrence, and tailored 
treatments could further improve recurrent CLM outcomes.
