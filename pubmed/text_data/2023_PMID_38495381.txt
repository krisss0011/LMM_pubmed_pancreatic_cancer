BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a poor prognosis and is 
highly metastatic. Our prior studies have demonstrated the critical role of axon 
guidance pathway genes in PDAC and the connection between neuronal development 
and the tumor microenvironment. A recent study newly identified 20 neuronal 
development genes [disks large homolog 2 (DLG2), neuron-glial-related cell 
adhesion molecule (NRCAM), neurexin3 (NRXN3), mitogen-activated protein kinase 
10 (MAPK10), platelet-derived growth factor D (PDGFD), protein kinase C epsilon 
(PRKCE), potassium calcium-activated channel subfamily M alpha 1 (KCNMA1), 
polycystic kidney and hepatic disease 1 (PKHD1), neural cell adhesion molecule 1 
(NCAM1), neuregulin-1 (NRG1), zinc finger protein 667 (ZNF667), cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), acyl-CoA medium-chain synthetase-3 
(ACSM3), complement 6 (C6), protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type M 
(PTPRM), hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1A), adenylyl cyclase 5 (ADCY5), 
adherens junctions-associated protein 1 (AJAP1), neurobeachin (NBEA), sodium 
voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 9 (SCN9A)] that are associated with 
perineural invasion and poor prognosis of PDAC. The relationship between genetic 
alterations in these 20 genes and tumor immune microenvironment (TME) has not 
previously been investigated.
METHODS: We hence applied the sequential multiplex immunohistochemistry results 
of biopsy specimens from 63 PDAC patients to investigate this relationship.
RESULTS: We found that, except for PTPRM and NBEA, genetic alterations involving 
these 20 genes are associated with significant changes in the densities of major 
immune cell subtypes. Except for AJAP1, the copy number loss involving this 
panel of neuronal development genes is significantly associated with changes in 
immune cell infiltrates. In contrast, the copy number gain in fewer genes, 
including NRXN3, ZNF667, ACSM3, C6, ADCY5, SCN9A, and PRKCE, is significantly 
associated with changes in immune cell infiltrates.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that neuronal development genes play a role in 
modulating TME in a pancreatic cancer setting.
