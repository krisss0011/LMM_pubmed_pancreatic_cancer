Gemcitabine is frequently utilized to treat pancreatic cancer. The purpose of 
our study was to create a gemcitabine-resistant MIA-PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer 
cell line (MIA-GR100) and to evaluate the anti-pancreatic cancer efficacy of 
HMJ-38, a new quinazolinone analogue. Compared to their parental counterparts, 
MIA-PaCa-2, established MIA-GR100 cells were less sensitive to gemcitabine. 
MIA-GR100 cell viability was not affected by 10, 50 and 100 nM gemcitabine 
concentrations. HMJ-38 reduced MIA-GR100 cell growth and induced autophagy and 
apoptosis. When stained with monodansylcadaverine (MDC), acridine orange (AO), 
and terminal deoxynucleotide transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), 
MIA-GR100 cells shrunk, punctured their membranes, and produced autophagy 
vacuoles and apoptotic bodies. Combining chloroquine (CQ) and 3-methyladenine 
(3-MA) with HMJ-38 dramatically reduced cell viability, indicating that 
autophagy function as a cytoprotective mechanism. MIA-GR100 cells treated with 
both z-VAD-FMK and HMJ-38 were much more viable than those treated with HMJ-38 
alone. HMJ-38 promotes apoptosis in MIA-GR100 cells by activating caspases. 
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is one of HMJ-38's principal targets, as 
determined via in silico target screening with network prediction. HMJ-38 also 
inhibited EGFR kinase activity and EGFR-associated signaling in MIA-GR100 cells. 
HMJ-38 may be an effective chemotherapeutic adjuvant for gemcitabine-resistant 
pancreatic cancer cells, in which it induces an antitumor response.
