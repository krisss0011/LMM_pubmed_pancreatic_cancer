OBJECTIVES: Poor oral intake (POI) without an identifiable cause is frequently 
observed after distal pancreatectomy (DP). This study was designed to 
investigate the incidence and risk factors of POI after DP, and its impact on 
the length of hospital stay.
METHODS: The prospectively collected data of patients who received DP were 
retrospectively reviewed. A diet protocol after DP was followed, and POI after 
DP was defined as the oral intake being less than 50% of the daily requirement 
and parenteral calorie supply being required on postoperative day 7.
RESULTS: Of the 157 patients, 21.7% (34) experienced POI after DP. The 
multivariate analysis revealed that the remnant pancreatic margin (head; hazard 
ratio, 7.837; 95% confidence interval, 2.111-29.087; P = 0.002) and 
postoperative hyperglycemia >200 mg/dL (hazard ratio, 5.643; 95% confidence 
interval, 1.482-21.494; P = 0.011) were independent risk factors for POI after 
DP. The length of hospital stay (median [range]) of the POI group was 
significantly longer than that of the normal diet group (17 [9-44] vs 10 [5-44] 
days; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing pancreatic resection at pancreatic head portion 
should follow a postoperative diet, and postoperative glucose levels should be 
strictly regulated.
