A 68-year-old man was referred to our hospital for detailed examination of the 
pancreatic tail tumor. The tumor was diagnosed as the pancreatic invasive ductal 
adenocarcinoma and the distal pancreatectomy was scheduled. During surgery, a 2 
mm white nodule was observed on the posterior wall of the stomach. 
Intraoperative frozen section showed no obvious malignant findings, suggesting 
leiomyoma or gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Distal pancreatectomy with D2 
lymphadenectomy was completed as planned. However, this nodule was later 
confirmed by permanent pathological specimen to be peritoneal dissemination of 
pancreatic cancer and final diagnosis was invasive ductal carcinoma of 
pancreatic tail, pT3, pN1a, M1 (PER), pStage â…£. He received chemotherapy for 17 
months. Although liver metastasis was appeared 26 months after surgery, the 
disease is still being controlled with chemotherapy at 33 months.
