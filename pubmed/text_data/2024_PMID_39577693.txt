BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced-stage pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) 
are regularly treated with FOLFIRINOX, a chemotherapy regimen based on 
5-fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin, which is associated with high 
toxicity. Dosing of FOLFIRINOX is based on body surface area, risking under- or 
overdosing caused by altered pharmacokinetics due to interindividual differences 
in body composition. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between 
body composition and treatment toxicity in advanced stage PDAC patients treated 
with FOLFIRINOX.
METHODS: Data from patients treated at the Maastricht University Medical Centre+ 
between 2012-2020 were collected retrospectively (n=65). Skeletal muscle-, 
visceral adipose tissue, subcutaneous adipose tissue-, (SM-Index, VAT-Index, 
SAT-Index resp.) and Skeletal Muscle Radiation Attenuation (SM-RA) were 
calculated after segmentation of computed tomography (CT) images at the third 
lumbar level using a validated deep learning method. Lean body mass (LBM) was 
estimated using SM-Index. Toxicities were scored and grade 3-4 adverse events 
were considered dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs).
RESULTS: Sixty-seven DLTs were reported during the median follow-up of 51.4 
(95%CI 39.2 - 63.7) weeks. Patients who experienced at least one DLT had 
significantly higher dose intensity per LBM for all separate cytotoxics of 
FOLFIRINOX. Independent prognostic factors for the number of DLTs per cycle 
were: sarcopenia (β=0.292; 95%CI 0.013 - 0.065; p=0.013), SM-Index change (% per 
30 days, β=-0.045; 95%CI -0.079 - -0.011; p=0.011), VAT-Index change (% per 30 
days, β=-0.006; 95%CI -0.012 - 0.000; p=0.040) between diagnosis and the first 
follow-up CT scan, and cumulative relative dose intensity >80% (β=-0.315; 95% CI 
-0.543 - -0.087; p=0.008).
CONCLUSION: Sarcopenia and early muscle and fat wasting during FOLFIRINOX 
treatment were associated with treatment-related toxicity, warranting 
exploration of body composition guided personalized dosing of chemotherapeutics 
to limit DLTs.
