Pancreatic and bile duct metastases from esophageal cancer are extremely rare. 
We report a case of advanced esophageal cancer successfully treated with 
chemotherapy, selected on the basis of an accurate pathologic diagnosis. A 
69-year-old man with chronic renal dysfunction presented with persistent 
abdominal pain and anorexia. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed an 
irregular-shaped tumor in the lower esophagus. Computed tomography and 
ultrasonography revealed swollen para-aortic lymph nodes, a pancreatic mass, and 
distal bile duct stenosis. Histopathological examination showed that all of the 
lesions were squamous cell carcinoma with unique immunohistochemical 
characteristics of p40+ and cytokeratin 7+. The final diagnosis was esophageal 
squamous cell carcinoma accompanied by lymph node, pancreas, and bile duct 
metastases. Taking his renal dysfunction into consideration, modified FOLFOX was 
administered as the first-line chemotherapy. The patient survived for 15 months 
since his first presentation. The favorable outcome was attributed to the 
accurate diagnosis based on comprehensive tissue sampling.

STING agonist has recently gained much attention for cancer treatment, but the 
therapeutic potential of STING agonist is hampered by STING-associated tumor 
immune resistance. In this work, guided by both bioinformatics and computer 
modeling, we rationally designed a "one stone hits two birds" nanoparticle-based 
strategy to simultaneously activate STING innate immune response while 
eliminating STING-associated immune resistance for the treatment of pancreatic 
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We discovered that the ultra-small sized micellar 
system based on gemcitabine-conjugated polymer (PGEM), which showed superior 
capacity of penetration in pancreatic tumor spheroid model and orthotopic tumor 
model, could serve as a novel "STING agonist". The activation of STING signaling 
in dendritic cells (DCs) by PGEM increased both innate nature killer (NK) and 
adaptive anti-tumor T cell response. However, activation of STING signaling by 
PGEM in tumor cells also drove the induction of chemokines CCL2 and CCL7, 
resulting in immune resistance by recruiting tumor associated macrophage (TAM) 
and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Through the combination of 
computer modeling and experimental screening, we developed a dual delivery 
modality by incorporating a CCR2 (the receptor shared by both CCL2 and CCL7) 
antagonist PF-6309 (PF) into PGEM micellar system. Our studies demonstrated that 
PGEM/PF formulation significantly reduced pancreatic tumor burden and induced 
potent anti-tumor immunity through reversing the CCL2/CCL7-mediated 
immunosuppression. Moreover, PGEM/PF sensitized PDAC tumors to anti-PD-1 
therapy, leading to complete suppression/eradication of the tumors. Our work has 
shed light to the multi-faceted role of STING activation and provided a novel 
immunotherapy regimen to maximize the benefit of STING activation for PDAC 
treatment. In addition, this work paved a new way for bioinformatics and 
computer modeling-guided rational design of nanomedicine.

Liver venous deprivation (LVD) is an emerging, minimally invasive strategy to 
induce rapid liver hypertrophy of the future liver remnant (FLR) before a major 
hepatectomy. LVD (aka "double vein embolization") entails same-session 
percutaneous embolization of the portal and hepatic veins of the planned liver 
resection. This report discusses LVD's utilization and technical challenges in 
managing a 49-year-old male with recurrent multifocal colorectal liver 
metastases (CRLM). The patient initially underwent neoadjuvant FOLFOX 
chemotherapy followed by a simultaneous laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy and liver 
surgery (microwave ablation of segment V and wedge resections of segment one and 
IVb), followed by completion of chemotherapy. The patient had an R0 resection 
with clear colon and liver surgical margins. Nine months after the initial 
surgery, the patient had a rise in tumor markers, and surveillance imaging 
demonstrated recurrence of liver metastases in segments I and V. LVD was 
performed by interventional radiology, which led to a 28% increase in FLR 
(segments II, III, and IV); initially measuring 464 cm3 before LVD and measuring 
594 cm3 on post-procedure day 21. The patient underwent right hemi-hepatectomy 
and caudate resection on post-procedure day 29. The patient did not have any 
complications and was discharged on postoperative day 6. The patient remains 
disease-free with no evidence of recurrence at 12 months follow-up.

Insulinomas are rare insulin-secreting tumors of pancreatic origin that cause 
hypoglycemia and can be associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 
(MEN1). While rare, they are the most common cause of hypoglycemia related to 
endogenous hyperinsulinism. A 28-year-old woman with known MEN1 presented with 
postprandial hypoglycemia in the second trimester of pregnancy. Prior to her 
presentation she was known to have several pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors that 
had been stable on serial imaging, but no history of hypoglycemia. She was 
managed with dietary intervention during pregnancy and gave birth to a healthy 
baby at 37 weeks' gestation. After pregnancy, hypoglycemia initially resolved, 
but then recurred at 8 months post partum. Magnetic resonance imaging showed 
several pancreatic neoplasms with the largest lesion measuring 29 mm in the 
pancreatic tail, unchanged from previous imaging. After localization with a 
selective arterial calcium stimulation test, the patient underwent successful 
distal pancreatectomy with resolution of symptoms. This case is unusual in that 
her initial presentation was during pregnancy, she had predominantly 
postprandial rather than fasting hypoglycemia, and her symptoms remitted for 
several months after delivery. Key learning points are to have a low index of 
suspicion for an insulinoma when there is a history of MEN1 and the need for a 
pragmatic approach to diagnosis and treatment during pregnancy.

We describe a patient with acromegaly presenting in diabetic ketoacidosis who 
was able to achieve euglycemia despite discontinuation of all antihyperglycemic 
therapy prior to surgical or medical treatment for his acromegaly. No previous 
cases of acromegaly presenting in diabetic ketoacidosis have reported glycemic 
normalization without antihyperglycemic therapy prior to acromegaly treatment. 
Our case highlights this unique outcome and postulates that pancreatic β-cell 
resiliency may be influential on insulin resistance since our patient achieved 
euglycemia despite a persistent state of excess growth hormone and insulin-like 
growth factor-1. Our case further emphasizes that consideration for acromegaly 
should be given in patients presenting with severe insulin resistance and 
pertinent medical history and physical examination features, and it emphasizes 
the dramatic range of insulin requirements in patients with acromegaly.

OBJECTIVE: To discuss the clinical diagnosis and treatment of extragonadal germ 
cell tumor.
METHODS: We analyzed the clinical data on a case of extragonadal germ cell tumor 
diagnosed and treated in the General Hospital of Eastern Theater Command and 
reviewed the relevant literature.
RESULTS: The patient was initially diagnosed with retroperitoneal tumor and 
treated by resection of the tumor together with the left kidney due to the large 
volume of the tumor, which was complicated by pancreatic injury. Postoperative 
pathology showed it to be extragonadal germ cell malignancy. Postoperative 
examination revealed space-occupying lesion in the left testis, with serum alpha 
fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionicgonadotropin (hCG) and lactate dehydrogenase 
(LDH) negative, followed by stage-two resection of the left testis, which was 
pathologically shown with testicular seminoma. The patient received 7 courses of 
cisplatin, etoposide bleomycin (PEB) regimen and was followed up for 8 years, 
which found no recurrence or metastasis, and the patient fathered no child 
during the postoperative follow-up.
CONCLUSION: For patients with a history of cryptorchidism and tumors located in 
the central axis, special attention should be paid to physical examination of 
the testes, testicular ultrasonography, and determination of AFP and other 
indicators to identify gonadal tumor metastasis. And if so, radiotherapy and 
chemotherapy can be considered first to reduce surgical complications and 
achieve accurate management.

Background: Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest forms of cancer. The 
cancer grades define how aggressively the cancer will spread and give indication 
for doctors to make proper prognosis and treatment. The current method of 
pancreatic cancer grading, by means of manual examination of the cancerous 
tissue following a biopsy, is time consuming and often results in misdiagnosis 
and thus incorrect treatment. This paper presents an automated grading system 
for pancreatic cancer from pathology images developed by comparing deep learning 
models on two different pathological stains. Methods: A transfer-learning 
technique was adopted by testing the method on 14 different ImageNet pre-trained 
models. The models were fine-tuned to be trained with our dataset. Results: From 
the experiment, DenseNet models appeared to be the best at classifying the 
validation set with up to 95.61% accuracy in grading pancreatic cancer despite 
the small sample set. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the 
first work in grading pancreatic cancer based on pathology images. Previous 
works have either focused only on detection (benign or malignant), or on 
radiology images (computerized tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] 
etc.). The proposed system can be very useful to pathologists in facilitating an 
automated or semi-automated cancer grading system, which can address the 
problems found in manual grading.

INTRODUCTION: The phase III IMbrave150 study established atezolizumab + 
bevacizumab as standard of care in patients with unresectable hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC). This exploratory analysis reports efficacy and safety results 
in patients with baseline Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B disease.
METHODS: Patients with systemic treatment-naive unresectable HCC and Child-Pugh 
class A liver function were randomized 2:1 to receive 1,200 mg of atezolizumab 
plus 15 mg/kg of bevacizumab or 400 mg of sorafenib. Co-primary endpoints were 
overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) per independent review 
facility (IRF)-assessed Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) 
version 1.1 in the BCLC stage B subgroup. Patients in this analysis had BCLC 
stage B disease at baseline per electronic case report form. Secondary efficacy 
endpoints included the objective response rate (ORR) and change in the sum of 
longest diameters (SLD) of target lesions from baseline per IRF RECIST 1.1 and 
modified RECIST (mRECIST) for HCC.
RESULTS: Of 501 enrolled patients, 74 (15%) had BCLC stage B disease at baseline 
(atezolizumab + bevacizumab, n = 49; sorafenib, n = 24). For this group, median 
follow-up was 19.7 months. A trend toward improved OS and PFS per IRF RECIST 1.1 
was observed with atezolizumab + bevacizumab versus sorafenib (OS: hazard ratio 
[HR]: 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.29, 1.34; PFS: HR: 0.64; 95% CI: 
0.36, 1.12). ORRs per IRF RECIST 1.1 and HCC mRECIST were 43% and 50% with 
atezolizumab + bevacizumab and 26% and 30% with sorafenib, respectively. 
Percentage change in SLD of target lesions from baseline per IRF RECIST 1.1 and 
HCC mRECIST showed durable responses with atezolizumab + bevacizumab treatment. 
Safety data were consistent with known profiles of atezolizumab and bevacizumab, 
as seen in the overall study population.
DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Efficacy benefits were observed with atezolizumab + 
bevacizumab in patients with baseline BCLC stage B disease, consistent with the 
intention-to-treat population.

INTRODUCTION: The actual rate of conversion surgery and its prognostic 
advantages remain unclear. This study aimed to assess the outcomes of salvage 
surgery after conversion therapy with triple therapy (transcatheter arterial 
chemoembolization [TACE] combined with lenvatinib plus anti-PD-1 antibodies) in 
patients with initially unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC).
METHODS: Patients with initially uHCC who received at least one cycle of 
first-line triple therapy and salvage surgery at five major cancer centers in 
China were included. The primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and 
recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates after salvage surgery. The secondary 
endpoints were perioperative complications, 90-day mortality, and pathological 
tumor response.
RESULTS: Between June 2018 and December 2021, 70 patients diagnosed with uHCC 
who underwent triple therapy and salvage surgery were analyzed: 39 with 
Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage C, 22 with BCLC stage B, and 9 with 
BCLC stage A disease. The median interval between the start of triple therapy 
and salvage surgery was 4.3 months (range, 1.7-14.2 months). Pathological 
complete response and major pathological response were observed in 29 (41.4%) 
and 59 (84.3%) patients, respectively. There were 2 cases of perioperative 
mortality (4.3%) and 5 cases of severe perioperative complications (7.1%). With 
a median follow-up of 12.9 months after surgery (range, 0.3-36.8 months), the 
median OS and RFS were not reached. The 1- and 2-year OS rates were 97.1% and 
94.4%, respectively, and the corresponding RFS rates were 68.9% and 54.4%, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: First-line combination of TACE, lenvatinib, and anti-PD-1 antibodies 
provides a better chance of conversion therapy in patients with initially uHCC. 
Furthermore, salvage surgery after conversion therapy is effective and safe and 
has the potential to provide excellent long-term survival benefits.

INTRODUCTION: Lenvatinib plus an anti-PD-1 antibody has shown promising 
antitumor effects in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but 
with clinical benefit limited to a subset of patients. We developed and 
validated a radiomic-based model to predict objective response to this 
combination therapy in advanced HCC patients.
METHODS: Patients (N = 170) who received first-line combination therapy with 
lenvatinib plus an anti-PD-1 antibody were retrospectively enrolled from 9 
Chinese centers; 124 and 46 into the training and validation cohorts, 
respectively. Radiomic features were extracted from pretreatment 
contrast-enhanced MRI. After feature selection, clinicopathologic, radiomic, and 
clinicopathologic-radiomic models were built using a neural network. The 
performance of models, incremental predictive value of radiomic features 
compared with clinicopathologic features and relationship between radiomic 
features and survivals were assessed.
RESULTS: The clinicopathologic model modestly predicted objective response with 
an AUC of 0.748 (95% CI: 0.656-0.840) and 0.702 (95% CI: 0.547-0.884) in the 
training and validation cohorts, respectively. The radiomic model predicted 
response with an AUC of 0.886 (95% CI: 0.815-0.957) and 0.820 (95% CI: 
0.648-0.984), respectively, with good calibration and clinical utility. The 
incremental predictive value of radiomic features to clinicopathologic features 
was confirmed with a net reclassification index of 47.9% (p < 0.001) and 41.5% 
(p = 0.025) in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. Furthermore, 
radiomic features were associated with overall survival and progression-free 
survival both in the training and validation cohorts, but modified 
albumin-bilirubin grade and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio were not.
CONCLUSION: Radiomic features extracted from pretreatment MRI can predict 
individualized objective response to combination therapy with lenvatinib plus an 
anti-PD-1 antibody in patients with unresectable or advanced HCC, provide 
incremental predictive value over clinicopathologic features, and are associated 
with overall survival and progression-free survival after initiation of this 
combination regimen.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to determine the factors influencing 
pancreatic surgery patients' perceptions of the shared decision-making process 
(SDM).
BACKGROUND: Decision-making in pancreatic surgery is complicated by the risk of 
morbidity and mortality and risk of early recurrence of disease. Improvement in 
SDM has the potential to improve the receipt of goal- and value-concordant care.
METHODS: This cross-sectional survey included patients who underwent pancreatic 
surgery. The following components were studied in relation to SDM: modified 
satisfaction with decision scale (SWD), modified decisional regret scale (DRS), 
quality of physician and patient interaction, and the impact of quality of life 
(FACT-Hep). Correlations were computed using Pearson's correlation score and a 
regression model.
RESULTS: The survey completion rate was 72.2% (of 40/55) and the majority 
(72.5%) of patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. There were significant 
positive relationships between the SDM measure and (DRS, SWD; r = 0.70, P < 
0.001) and responses to questions regarding how well the patient's actual 
recovery matched their expectations before treatment (r = 0.62, P < 0.001). The 
quality of the physician-patient relationship correlated with how well recovery 
matched expectations (r = 0.53, P = 0.002). SDM measure scores were significant 
predictors of the decision evaluation measure (R2(adj) = 0.48, P < 0.001), 
FACT-Hep (R2(adj) = 0.15, P < 0.001), and recovery expectations measure (R2(adj) 
= 0.37, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Improved SDM in pancreatic surgery is associated with more 
realistic recovery expectations, decreased decisional regret, and improved 
quality of life.

We present a 48-year-old male patient with a mass in the tail of the pancreas on 
abdominal ultrasonography. The lesion was suspicious for a well-differentiated 
pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor and spleen preserved distal pancreatectomy 
surgery was performed. It was diagnosed as intrapancreatic accessory spleen 
(IPAS) after pathological examination. Accessory spleen is not an infrequent 
congenital entity caused by the localization of normal splenic tissue in ectopic 
regions. As it is known, an accessory spleen is a benign entity and does not 
require surgical treatment or follow-up when detected. However, it is important 
to recognize IPAS tissue as it may mimic a pancreatic neoplasia when it is 
located in the pancreas. In this article, we discuss the differential diagnostic 
possibilities of the IPAS entity.

Gemcitabine is a broad-spectrum antimetabolite and a deoxycytidine analog 
recognized as a standard therapy alone or in combination with other 
antineoplastic agents in the therapy of pancreas cancer. Drug resistance 
following gemcitabine treatment is a common phenomenon; therefore, combinational 
therapy models are usually preferred. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, or 
pancreas cancer, is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. 
With the increasing incidence of pancreatic cancer every year, the mortality 
rate is also rising significantly because of late diagnosis, and limited 
chemotherapy options. Adjuvant chemotherapy after surgical resection is the 
typical option for the treatment of early pancreatic cancer. Mostly, 
5-fluorouracil/leucovorin with irinotecan and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) and 
gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel is used for the prognosis of advanced pancreatic 
cancer; however, chemoresistance usually occurs limiting the effectiveness of 
the chemotherapy. Therefore, most of the studies are focused on gemcitabine 
combination with other drugs to overcome the situation. As an apoptotic agent 
and a member of brassinosteroids, epibrassinolide (EBR) induces endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER) stress-dependent cell death in different cancer cells, as shown 
by our group. In this study, we aimed to enhance the gemcitabine apoptotic 
effect by EBR combined treatment in pancreatic cancer cells. EBR treatment 
reduced cell viability and inhibited cell proliferation in PANC-1, MIA PaCa-2, 
and AsPC-1 cells. Each pancreatic cancer cell gave different responses to the 
EBR treatment because of different aggressiveness. However, EBR induced 
apoptosis through increasing ROS generation, which was associated with ER stress 
in PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells. Gemcitabine alone reduced the cell viability of 
each pancreatic cancer cell line; however, combination with EBR led to further 
induction of apoptotic cell death in each pancreatic cancer cell line. In 
addition, combined treatment of gemcitabine and EBR further decreased N-cadherin 
and vimentin expressions, suggesting that epithelial-mesenchymal transition of 
pancreatic cells is reduced. In conclusion, EBR had therapeutic potential to 
avoid the gemcitabine-induced side effects during the treatment of pancreatic 
cancer.

The prognostic characteristics of pancreatic cancer (PC) are determined by the 
contributing factors from the tumor microenvironment. Leptin is a critical 
oncogenic factor released by adipocytes as an adipokine into the tumor 
microenvironment, where it promotes tumor development by activating cancer stem 
cell (CSC) molecular regulators Notch, Hedgehog, and Wnt/β-catenin signaling. 
One of the downstream targets of these pathways is CDK4/6 and cyclin D which is 
controlled by P16 INK4A that is highly mutated in PC. Therefore, the purpose of 
this study was to determine the effect of a CDK4/6 inhibitor, palbociclib, on 
Leptin-induced PC cells and to target the Notch, Hedgehog, and Wnt/β-catenin 
signaling pathways via miR-150, miR-506, and miR-208 modulation. Leptin 
treatment increased the ability of Panc-1, MiaPaCa-2, and Capan-2 cells to 
proliferate and decreased the effect of palbociclib. Additionally, tumorspheres 
were generated from Leptin-treated (Leptin+) and Leptin-untreated (Leptin-) 
Panc-1 and MiaPaCa-2 cells and transfected with miR-506, miR-150 
(tumorsuppressor miRNAs), or anti-miR-208 (oncomiR), followed by palbociclib 
treatment. Forced expression of miR-506 or miR-150 significantly increased the 
susceptibility of Leptin+ cells to palbociclib treatment by inhibiting colony 
and tumor spheroid formation, and CD44 expression in Panc-1 and MiaPaCa-2 cells. 
Additionally, the increased miR-150 expression is more effective at inhibiting 
N-cadherin, β-catenin, p-GSK3β, Notch, and Wnt5a/b expression in Leptin-/+ 
Panc-1 and MiaPaCa-2 cells. As a result, palbociclib suppressed the CSC profile 
induced by leptin treatment, inhibiting both tumorsphere forms and 
leptin-targeted signaling pathways, thereby disabling the Panc-1 and MiaPaCa-2 
cells' resistance mechanism. Increased expression of miR-506 or miR-150 and 
inhibition of miR-208 enhanced sensitivity of Panc-1 and MiaPaCa-2 Leptin-/+ 
cells to palbociclib treatment. As a result, this study proved that combining 
inhibitors of CSC molecular regulators with palbociclib improves the success 
rate of inhibition of PC cell proliferation.

Cell cytoskeleton proteins are involved in tumor pathogenesis, progression and 
pharmacological resistance. Filamin A (FLNA) is a large actin-binding protein 
with both structural and scaffold functions implicated in a variety of cellular 
processes, including migration, cell adhesion, differentiation, proliferation 
and transcription. The role of FLNA in cancers has been studied in multiple 
types of tumors. FLNA plays a dual role in tumors, depending on its subcellular 
localization, post-translational modification (as phosphorylation at Ser2125) 
and interaction with binding partners. This review summarizes the experimental 
evidence showing the critical involvement of FLNA in the complex biology of 
endocrine tumors. Particularly, the role of FLNA in regulating expression and 
signaling of the main pharmacological targets in pituitary neuroendocrine 
tumors, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors and 
adrenocortical carcinomas, with implications on responsiveness to currently used 
drugs in the treatment of these tumors, will be discussed.

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is an aggressive malignant tumor with low rate of 
surgical resection and poor prognosis. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a 
cytokine that has both protumor and antitumor activities, depending on tumor 
microenvironment. The interaction between TGF-β signaling and the tumor 
microenvironment in PC is complex. Here, we reviewed the role of TGF-β in the 
tumor microenvironment of PC, highlighting producers of TGF-β and TGF-β 
responders in the tumor microenvironment of PC.

Ginsenoside Rg1 Epigenetically Modulates Smad7 Expression in Liver Fibrosis via 
MicroRNA-152.

University, Wenzhou, China.

BACKGROUND: Ginsenoside Rg1, a bioactive component of Ginseng, has demonstrated 
anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and hepatoprotective effects. It is known that 
the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a key role in the activation 
of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Recently, Rg1 has been shown to reverse liver 
fibrosis by suppressing EMT, although the mechanism of Rg1-mediated 
anti-fibrosis effects is still largely unclear. Interestingly, Smad7, a negative 
regulator of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) pathway, is often 
methylated during liver fibrosis. Whether Smad7 methylation plays a vital role 
in the effects of Rg1 on liver fibrosis remains unclear.
METHODS: Anti-fibrosis effects were examined after Rg1 processing in vivo and 
in vitro. Smad7 expression, Smad7 methylation, and microRNA-152 (miR-152) levels 
were also analyzed.
RESULTS: Rg1 significantly reduced the liver fibrosis caused by carbon 
tetrachloride, and reduced collagen deposition was also observed. Rg1 also 
contributed to the suppression of collagenation and HSC reproduction in vitro. 
Rg1 caused EMT inactivation, reducing Desmin and increasing E-cadherin levels. 
Notably, the effect of Rg1 on HSC activation was mediated by the TGF-β pathway. 
Rg1 induced Smad7 expression and demethylation. The over-expression of DNA 
methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) blocked the Rg1-mediated inhibition of Smad7 
methylation, and miR-152 targeted DNMT1. Further experiments suggested that Rg1 
repressed Smad7 methylation via miR-152-mediated DNMT1 inhibition. MiR-152 
inhibition reversed the Rg1-induced promotion of Smad7 expression and 
demethylation. In addition, miR-152 silencing led to the inhibition of the 
Rg1-induced EMT inactivation.
CONCLUSION: Rg1 inhibits HSC activation by epigenetically modulating Smad7 
expression and at least by partly inhibiting EMT.

BACKGROUND: A solitary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) without macrovascular 
invasion and distant metastasis, regardless of tumor size, is currently 
classified as early-stage disease by the latest Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer 
(BCLC) staging system. While the preferred treatment is surgical resection, the 
association of tumor morphology with long-term survival outcomes after liver 
resection for a solitary huge HCC of ≥10 cm has not been defined.
METHODS: Patients who underwent curative liver resection for a solitary huge HCC 
were identified from a multicenter database. Preoperative imaging findings were 
used to define spherical- or ellipsoidal-shaped lesions with smooth edges as 
balloon-shaped HCCs (BS-HCCs); out-of-shape lesions or lesions of any shape with 
matt edges were defined as non-balloon-shaped HCCs (NBS-HCCs). The two groups of 
patients with BS-HCCs and NBS-HCCs were matched in a 1:1 ratio using propensity 
score matching (PSM). Clinicopathologic characteristics, long-term overall 
survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were assessed.
RESULTS: Among patients with a solitary huge HCC, 74 pairs of patients with 
BS-HCC and NBS-HCC were matched. Tumor pathological features including 
proportions of microvascular invasion, satellite nodules, and incomplete tumor 
encapsulation in the BS-HCC group were lower than the NBS-HCC group. At a median 
follow-up of 50.7 months, median OS and RFS of all patients with a solitary huge 
HCC after PSM were 27.8 and 10.1 months, respectively. The BS-HCC group had 
better median OS and RFS than the NBS-HCC group (31.9 vs. 21.0 months, P=0.01; 
and 19.7 vs. 6.4 months, P=0.015). Multivariate analyses identified BS-HCC as 
independently associated with better OS (HR =0.592, P=0.009) and RFS (HR =0.633, 
P=0.013).
CONCLUSIONS: For a solitary huge HCC, preoperative imaging on tumor morphology 
was associated with prognosis following resection. In particular, patients with 
BS-HCCs had better long-term survival following liver resection versus patients 
with large NBS-HCCs.

INTRODUCTION: Current treatments for patients with previously treated advanced 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) provide modest survival benefits. We evaluated 
the safety and antitumor activity of serplulimab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, plus 
the bevacizumab biosimilar HLX04 in this patient population.
METHODS: In this open-label, multicenter, phase 2 study in China, patients with 
advanced HCC who failed prior systemic therapy received serplulimab 3 mg/kg plus 
HLX04 5 mg/kg (group A) or 10 mg/kg (group B) intravenously every 2 weeks. The 
primary endpoint was safety.
RESULTS: As of April 8, 2021, 20 and 21 patients were enrolled into groups A and 
B, and they had received a median of 7 and 11 treatment cycles, respectively. 
Grade ≥3 treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 14 (70.0%) patients 
in group A and 12 (57.1%) in group B. Most immune-related adverse events were 
grade ≤3. The objective response rate was 30.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 
11.9-54.3) in group A and 14.3% (95% CI, 3.0-36.3) in group B. Median duration 
of response was not reached (95% CI, 3.3-not evaluable [NE]) in group A and was 
9.0 months (95% CI, 7.9-NE) in group B. Median progression-free survival was 2.2 
months (95% CI, 1.4-5.5) and 4.1 months (95% CI, 1.5-NE), and median overall 
survival was 11.6 months (95% CI, 6.4-NE) and 14.3 months (95% CI, 8.2-NE) in 
groups A and B, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Serplulimab plus HLX04 showed a manageable safety profile and 
promising antitumor activity in patients with previously treated advanced HCC.

Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications (e.g., 
acetylation and deacetylation), are strongly implicated in the carcinogenesis of 
various malignancies. During transcription, the expression and functionality of 
coding gene products are altered following the histone acetylation and 
deacetylation. These processes are regulated by histone acetyltransferases 
(HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), respectively. HDAC inhibitors (HDACis) 
have been developed as promising therapeutic agents, to limit exposure to 
traditional and toxic chemotherapies and offer more alternatives for some 
specific malignant diseases with limited options. Mechanistically, these agents 
affect many intracellular pathways, including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and 
differentiation, and their mechanism of action mainly depends on the type of 
cancer. Currently, five HDACis have been approved for the treatment of several 
hematological malignancies (e.g., T-cell lymphoma subtypes and multiple 
myeloma); while, many of them are tested for further therapeutic indications in 
solid tumors (e.g., colorectal, thyroid, breast, lung and pancreatic cancer). 
Herein, we review the literature and gather all available evidence, from in 
vitro and in vivo data to clinical trial results, that recognizes the antitumor 
activity of HDACis on pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas; and supports their 
clinical implementation in the treatment of these rare neuroendocrine tumors at 
metastatic setting.

5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent for various 
cancers. However, the drug resistance developed by tumor cells hinders the 
therapeutic effect. Konjac glucomannan (KGM) is indicated to sensitize 
5-FU-resistant hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells to 5-FU. In our study, we 
found that KGM or 5-FU treatment alone did not affect the malignant cell 
behaviors and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress of 5-FU-resistant HCC cells or 
HepG2/5-FU and Bel-7402/5-FU cells, while cotreatment with KGM and 5-FU 
significantly facilitated HCC cell apoptosis and ER stress and suppressed cell 
proliferation potential and migration abilities. Moreover, we explored the 
underlying mechanism by which KGM induces 5-FU cytotoxicity in HCC cells. We 
found that Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) was downregulated in KGM- and 
5-FU-treated HCC cells. TLR4 overexpression reversed the KGM and 5-FU 
cotreatment-induced inhibition of the malignant behaviors of 5-FU-resistant HCC 
cells. Furthermore, KGM enhanced 5-FU-induced ER stress by inhibiting TLR4 to 
activate PERK/ATF4/CHOP signaling. Xenograft mouse models were established using 
HepG2/5-FU cells, and KGM was demonstrated to reverse 5-FU resistance in HCC 
tumors in vivo by suppressing TLR4 to enhance ER stress and activate 
PERK/ATF4/CHOP signaling. In conclusion, KGM combined with 5-FU treatment 
significantly promoted apoptosis and reduced cell proliferation, migration and 
ER stress in 5-FU-resistant HCC cells compared with KGM or 5-FU treatment alone 
by downregulating TLR4 to activate PERK/ATF4/CHOP signaling.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study aimed to clarify the efficacy and safety of 
pancreatic duct lavage cytology combined with a cell-block method (PLC-CB) for 
possible pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs).
METHODS: This study included 41 patients with suspected PDACs who underwent 
PLC-CB mainly because they were unfit for undergoing endoscopic 
ultrasonography-guided fine needle aspiration. A 6-Fr double lumen catheter was 
mainly used to perform PLC-CB. Final diagnoses were obtained from the findings 
of resected specimens or clinical outcomes during surveillance after PLC-CB.
RESULTS: Histocytological evaluations using PLC-CB were performed in 87.8% 
(36/41) of the patients. For 31 of the 36 patients, final diagnoses (invasive 
PDAC, 12; pancreatic carcinoma in situ, 5; benignancy, 14) were made, and the 
remaining five patients were excluded due to lack of surveillance periods after 
PLC-CB. For 31 patients, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of PLC-CB 
for detecting malignancy were 94.1%, 100%, and 96.8%, respectively. In addition, 
they were 87.5%, 100%, and 94.1%, respectively, in 17 patients without 
pancreatic masses detectable using endoscopic ultrasonography. Four patients 
developed postprocedural pancreatitis, which improved with conservative therapy.
CONCLUSION: PLC-CB has an excellent ability to detect malignancies in patients 
with possible PDACs, including pancreatic carcinoma in situ.

OBJECTIVE: To review the impact of age on perioperative and postoperative 
outcomes in patients following pancreaticoduodenectomy.
METHODS: The retrospective study was conducted at the Shaukat Khanum Memorial 
Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Lahore, Pakistan, and comprised data from 
January 2014 to December 2018 of all patients who underwent 
pancreatoduodenectomy. Postoperative morbidity and oncological outcomes were 
compared between patients aged ≤60 years in group A and those aged >60 years in 
group B. Data was analysed using SPSS 20.
RESULTS: Of the 161 patients, 103(64%) were males and 58(36%) were females. 
There were 117(73%) patients in group A; 72(61.5%) males and 45(38.5%) females 
with an overall mean age of 46±11 years. The remaining 44(27%) were in group B; 
31(70.5%) males and 13(29.5%) females with an overall mean age of 67±05 years. 
The most common pathology was adenocarcinoma 130(81%), commonest site was 
periampullary 85(53%) and the most common pancreatic reconstruction technique 
employed was pancreaticogastrostomy 110(68%). Patients in group B had 
significantly higher comorbidities compared to those in group A (p<0.05). 
Estimated blood loss during surgery was significantly higher in group B 
(p=0.004). There was no significant difference in overall morbidity (p=0.856), 
reoperation (p=1.000), 30-day readmission rate (p=0.097), 90-day mortality rate 
(p=0.324)) and overall survival (p=0.551) between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatoduodenectomy could be performed in the elderly with 
comparable morbidity and oncological outcomes as younger patients. Comorbid 
conditions remained higher in elderly patients and preoperative optimisation may 
help improve postoperative outcomes.

Irreversible electroporation of the pancreas - A decade on.

Ong DY(1), How GY(1), Pua U(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore.

Irreversible electroporation (IRE) employs the use of an electric field to cause 
irreversible permeability of the cell membrane, inducing apoptosis. The use of 
IRE for locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) was first described in 2012. 
The crucial advantage of IRE compared with other devices employing thermal 
ablation is the safety around vital structures such as vessels and ducts. This 
makes it an attractive option for use in the pancreas due to the close proximity 
of multiple major vascular structures, biliary ducts, and adjacent 
gastrointestinal organs. Over the past decade, IRE has established itself as a 
useful treatment adjunct and may soon become the standard of care, particularly 
for LAPC. This article will explore the current evidence and provide a concise 
summary of pertinent issues, including patient selection, preoperative 
management, clinical outcomes, radiological response and future prospects of IRE 
in pancreatic cancer.

BACKGROUND: Liver resection and local ablation are the only curative treatment 
for non-cirrhotic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Few data exist concerning the 
prognosis of patients resected for non-cirrhotic HCC. The objectives of this 
study were to determine the prognostic factors of recurrence-free survival (RFS) 
and overall survival (OS) and to develop a prognostication algorithm for 
non-cirrhotic HCC.
METHODS: French multicenter retrospective study including HCC patients with 
non-cirrhotic liver without underlying viral hepatitis: F0, F1 or F2 fibrosis.
RESULTS: A total of 467 patients were included in 11 centers from 2010 to 2018. 
Non-cirrhotic liver had a fibrosis score of F0 (n=237, 50.7%), F1 (n=127, 27.2%) 
or F2 (n=103, 22.1%). OS and RFS at 5 years were 59.2% and 34.5%, respectively. 
In multivariate analysis, microvascular invasion and HCC differentiation were 
prognostic factors of OS and RFS and the number and size were prognostic factors 
of RFS (P<0.005). Stratification based on RFS provided an algorithm based on 
size (P=0.013) and number (P<0.001): 2 HCC with the largest nodule ≤10 cm 
(n=271, Group 1); 2 HCC with a nodule >10 cm (n=176, Group 2); >2 HCC regardless 
of size (n=20, Group 3). The 5-year RFS rates were 52.7% (Group 1), 30.1% (Group 
2) and 5% (Group 3).
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a prognostication algorithm based on the number (≤ or 
>2) and size (≤ or >10 cm), which could be used as a treatment decision support 
concerning the need for perioperative therapy. In case of bifocal HCC, surgery 
should not be a contraindication.

A tumor's heterogeneity has important implications in terms of its clonal 
origin, progression, stemness, and drug resistance. Therefore, because of its 
significance in treatment, it is important to understand the gene expression 
pattern of a single cell, track gene expression or mutation in heterogeneous 
cells, evaluate the clonal origin of cancer cells, and determine the selective 
evolution of different subpopulations of cancer cells. Researchers are able to 
trace a cell's mutation and identify different types of tumor cells by measuring 
the whole transcriptome with single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq). This technology 
provides a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving tumor growth 
than that offered by traditional RNA sequencing methods. In addition, it has 
revealed changes in the mutations and functions of somatic cells as a tumor 
evolves; it has also clarified immune cell infiltration and activation. Research 
on scRNA-seq technology has recently advanced significantly, suggesting new 
strategies for the treatment of cancer. In short, cancer researchers have become 
increasingly dependent on scRNA-seq. This paper reviews the development, 
detection principles, and processes of scRNA-seq technology and their 
application in tumor research. It also considers potential clinical 
applications.

progression, and drug resistance of cancer cells.The gene expression pattern of 
a single cell has important biological significance.scRNA-seq enables a better 
understanding of cancer cells’ molecular mechanisms.scRNA-seq provides 
information about the entirety of a tumor from what we can learn about a single 
cell.

We describe a small molecule ligand ACA-14 (2-hydroxy-5-{[(2-phenylcyclopropyl) 
carbonyl] amino} benzoic acid) as an initial lead for the development of direct 
inhibitors of KRAS, a notoriously difficult anticancer drug target. We show that 
the compound binds to KRAS near the switch regions with affinities in the low 
micromolar range and exerts different effects on KRAS interactions with binding 
partners. Specifically, ACA-14 impedes the interaction of KRAS with its effector 
Raf and reduces both intrinsic and SOS-mediated nucleotide exchange rates. 
Likely as a result of these effects, ACA-14 inhibits signal transduction through 
the MAPK pathway in cells expressing mutant KRAS and inhibits the growth of 
pancreatic and colon cancer cells harboring mutant KRAS. We thus propose 
compound ACA-14 as a useful initial lead for the development of broad-acting 
inhibitors that target multiple KRAS mutants and simultaneously deplete the 
fraction of GTP-loaded KRAS while abrogating the effector-binding ability of the 
already GTP-loaded fraction.

OBJECTIVES: There have been conflicting reports concerning an increased risk of 
pancreatic cancer (PC) in new users of glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists 
(GLP-1As). We aimed to explore whether the use of GLP-1A is associated with an 
increased risk of PC.
METHODS: A multicenter, retrospective cohort study was conducted using TriNetX. 
Adult patients with diabetes and/or overweight and obesity who were newly 
treated with GLP-1A or metformin for the first time between 2006 and 2021 were 
matched 1:1 using propensity score matching. The risk of PC was estimated using 
a Cox proportional hazards model.
RESULTS: A total of 492,760 patients were identified in the GLP-1A and 918,711 
patients in the metformin group. After propensity score matching, both cohorts 
(370,490 each) were well matched. During follow-up, 351 patients in the GLP-1A 
and 956 on metformin developed PC after an exposure lag of 1 year. Glucagon-like 
peptide-1 agonists was associated with a significantly lower risk of PC (hazard 
ratio, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.42-0.52).
CONCLUSIONS: The use of GLP-1A in patients with obesity/diabetes is associated 
with a lower risk of PC compared with a similar cohort of patients using 
metformin. Our study findings reassure clinicians and patients with 
apprehensions about any possible association between GLP-1A and PC.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to evaluate the influence of cachexia at the 
time of diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) on prognosis in 
patients undergoing surgical resection.
METHODS: Patients with data on preoperative body weight (BW) change followed by 
surgical resection during 2008-2017 were selected. Large BW loss was defined as 
weight loss >5% or >2% in individuals with body mass index less than 20 kg/m2 
within 1 year preoperatively. Influence of large BW loss, ΔBW defined as 
preoperative BW change (%) per month, prognostic nutrition index, and indices of 
sarcopenia.
RESULTS: We evaluated 165 patients with PDAC. Preoperatively, 78 patients were 
categorized as having large BW loss. ΔBW was ≤ -1.34% per month (rapid) and > 
-1.34% per month (slow) in 95 and 70 patients, respectively. The median 
postoperative overall survival of rapid and slow ΔBW groups was 1.4 and 4.4 
years, respectively (P < 0.001). In multivariate analyses rapid ΔBW (hazard 
ratio [HR], 3.88); intraoperative blood loss ≥430 mL (HR, 1.89); tumor size ≥2.9 
cm (HR, 1.74); and R1/2 resection (HR, 1.77) were independent predictors of 
worse survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative rapid BW loss ≥1.34% per month was an independent 
predictor of worse survival of patients with PDAC.

of California Davis, Sacramento, CA.

OBJECTIVES: Comorbid psychiatric illness has been associated with worse outcomes 
after some major surgical procedures. We hypothesized that patients with 
preexisting mood disorders would have worse postoperative and oncologic outcomes 
after pancreatic cancer resection.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed Surveillance, Epidemiology, 
and End Results patients with resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma. A 
preexisting mood disorder was classified if a patient was diagnosed and/or 
treated with medication approved for depression/anxiety within 6 months before 
surgery.
RESULTS: Of 1305 patients, 16% had a preexisting mood disorder. Mood disorders 
had no impact on hospital length of stay (12.9 vs 13.2 days, P = 0.75), 30-day 
complications (26% vs 22%, P = 0.31), 30-day readmissions (26% vs 21%, P = 0.1), 
or mortality (30 days: 3% vs 4%, P = 0.35); only an increased 90-day 
readmissions rate (42% vs 31%, P = 0.001) was observed. No effect on adjuvant 
chemotherapy receipt (62.5% vs 69.2%, P = 0.06) or survival (24 months, 43% vs 
39%, P = 0.44) was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Preexisting mood disorders influenced 90-day readmissions after 
pancreatic resection, but not other postoperative or oncologic outcomes. These 
findings suggest that affected patients should be expected to have outcomes 
similar to patients without mood disorders.

Study," Bari, Italy.

OBJECTIVES: Differential diagnosis between pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 
(PDAC) and benign mimickers can be very difficult on small histological samples, 
such as fine needle aspiration biopsies (FNAB). We aimed to investigate the 
diagnostic value of immunostaining for IMP3, Maspin, S100A4, S100P, TFF2, and 
TFF3 in FNAB pancreatic lesions.
METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 20 consecutive patients with suspected PDAC, 
collecting FNABs at our department between 2019 and 2021.
RESULTS: Three of the 20 enrolled patients resulted negative for all 
immunohistochemical markers, while all the others were positive for Maspin. All 
other immunohistochemistry (IHC) markers had sensitivity and accuracy of less 
than 100%. On the basis of the IHC, the preoperative diagnosis on FNAB was 
nonmalignant lesions in the IHC negative cases and PDAC in the others. All 
patients subsequently underwent surgery for the pancreatic solid mass 
demonstrated by imaging techniques. The concordance between the preoperative and 
postoperative diagnosis was 100%; all IHC negative samples were diagnosed on 
surgical specimens as chronic pancreatitis and Maspin-positive samples as PDAC.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that even in the presence of little 
histological material, such as FNAB, the use of Maspin alone is sufficient to 
discriminate between PDAC and nonmalignant pancreatic lesions, with 100% 
accuracy.

OBJECTIVES: Racial-ethnic disparities in pain management are common but not 
known among pancreatic disease patients. We sought to evaluate racial-ethnic 
disparities in opioid prescriptions for pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer 
patients.
METHODS: Data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey were used to 
examine racial-ethnic and sex differences in opioid prescriptions for ambulatory 
visits by adult pancreatic disease patients.
RESULTS: We identified 207 pancreatitis and 196 pancreatic cancer patient 
visits, representing 9.8 million visits, but weights were repealed for analysis. 
No sex differences in opioid prescriptions were found among pancreatitis (P = 
0.78) or pancreatic cancer patient visits (P = 0.57). Opioids were prescribed at 
58% of Black, 37% of White, and 19% of Hispanic pancreatitis patient visits (P = 
0.05). Opioid prescriptions were less common in Hispanic versus non-Hispanic 
pancreatitis patients (odds ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.91; P = 
0.03). We found no racial-ethnic differences in opioid prescriptions among 
pancreatic cancer patient visits.
CONCLUSIONS: Racial-ethnic disparities in opioid prescriptions were observed in 
pancreatitis, but not pancreatic cancer patient visits, suggesting possible 
racial-ethnic bias in opioid prescription practices for patients with benign 
pancreatic disease. However, there is a lower threshold for opioid provision in 
the treatment of malignant, terminal disease.

Gwangmyeong-Si, Korea.

OBJECTIVES: Poor oral intake (POI) without an identifiable cause is frequently 
observed after distal pancreatectomy (DP). This study was designed to 
investigate the incidence and risk factors of POI after DP, and its impact on 
the length of hospital stay.
METHODS: The prospectively collected data of patients who received DP were 
retrospectively reviewed. A diet protocol after DP was followed, and POI after 
DP was defined as the oral intake being less than 50% of the daily requirement 
and parenteral calorie supply being required on postoperative day 7.
RESULTS: Of the 157 patients, 21.7% (34) experienced POI after DP. The 
multivariate analysis revealed that the remnant pancreatic margin (head; hazard 
ratio, 7.837; 95% confidence interval, 2.111-29.087; P = 0.002) and 
postoperative hyperglycemia >200 mg/dL (hazard ratio, 5.643; 95% confidence 
interval, 1.482-21.494; P = 0.011) were independent risk factors for POI after 
DP. The length of hospital stay (median [range]) of the POI group was 
significantly longer than that of the normal diet group (17 [9-44] vs 10 [5-44] 
days; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing pancreatic resection at pancreatic head portion 
should follow a postoperative diet, and postoperative glucose levels should be 
strictly regulated.

OBJECTIVES: Given the complex surgical management and infrequency of pancreatic 
neuroendocrine tumor, we hypothesized that treatment at a center of excellence 
improves survival.
METHODS: Retrospective review identified 354 patients with pancreatic 
neuroendocrine tumor treated between 2010 and 2018. Four hepatopancreatobiliary 
centers of excellence were created from 21 hospitals throughout Northern 
California. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. The χ2 test of 
clinicopathologic factors determined which were predictive for overall survival 
(OS).
RESULTS: Localized disease was seen in 51% of patients, and metastatic disease 
was seen in 32% of patients with mean OS of 93 and 37 months, respectively (P < 
0.001). On multivariate survival analysis, stage, tumor location, and surgical 
resection were significant for OS (P < 0.001). All stage OS for patients treated 
at designated centers was 80 and 60 months for noncenters (P < 0.001). Surgery 
was more common across stages at the centers of excellence versus noncenters at 
70% and 40%, respectively (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are indolent but have malignant 
potential at any size with management often requiring complex surgeries. We 
showed survival was improved for patients treated at a center of excellence, 
where surgery was more frequently utilized.

Should Positive Cytology Revealed by Intraoperative Lavage Preclude Radical 
Resection in Resectable Pancreatic Cancer?: A Systemic Review and Meta-analysis.

Author information:

Beijing, China.

OBJECTIVES: The aims of this review were to determine whether positive 
peritoneal lavage cytology (CY+) precludes radical resection in pancreatic 
cancer and to propose prospections for future studies.
METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central were searched for related 
articles. Dichotomous variables and survival outcomes were analyzed with the 
estimation of odds ratio and hazards ratio (HR), respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 4905 patients were included, of which 7.8% were CY+. 
Positive peritoneal lavage cytology was correlated with poor overall survival 
(univariate survival analysis [HR, 2.35; P < 0.00001]; multivariate analysis 
[HR, 1.62; P < 0.00001]), poor recurrence-free survival (univariate survival 
analysis [HR, 2.50; P < 0.00001]; multivariate analysis [HR, 1.84; P < 
0.00001]), and higher initial peritoneal recurrence rate (odds ratio, 5.49; P < 
0.00001).
CONCLUSIONS: Although CY+ predicts poor prognosis and a higher risk of 
peritoneal metastasis after curative resection, it is not sufficient to preclude 
curative resection based on the current evidence, and high-quality trials should 
be conducted to assess the prognostic impact of operation among resectable CY+ 
patients. In addition, more sensitive and accurate methods to detect peritoneal 
exfoliated tumor cells and more effective comprehensive treatment for resectable 
CY+ pancreatic cancer patients are clearly warranted.

BACKGROUND: Approximately 20%-40% of patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) 
disease, an autosomal dominant hereditary disease, exhibit large deletions 
(LDs). Few studies have focused on this population. Hence, we aimed to elucidate 
the genotype-phenotype correlations and clinical outcomes in VHL patients with 
LDs.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, we included 119 patients with VHL disease 
from 50 unrelated families in whom LDs were detected using traditional and 
next-generation sequencing methods. Other germline mutations were confirmed by 
Sanger sequencing. Genotype-phenotype correlations and survival were analysed in 
different groups using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression. We also evaluated 
therapeutic response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy.
RESULTS: The overall penetrance of patients aged <60 was 95.2%. Two VHL patients 
with LDs also carried CHEK2 and FLCN germline mutations. An earlier age of onset 
of retinal haemangioblastoma was observed in the next generation. Patients with 
exon 2 deletion of VHL had an earlier onset age of renal cell carcinoma and 
pancreatic lesions. The risk of renal cell carcinoma was lower in VHL patients 
with LDs and a BRK1 deletion. The group with earlier age of onset received 
poorer prognosis. Four of eight (50%) patients showed partial response to TKI 
therapy.
CONCLUSION: The number of generations and the status of exon 2 could affect age 
of onset of VHL-related manifestations. Onset age was an independent risk factor 
for overall survival. TKI therapy was effective in VHL patients with LDs. Our 
findings would further support clinical surveillance and decision-making 
processes.

Pancreatic cancer and its rare subtype, acinar cell carcinoma (PACC), frequently 
harbor germline and/or somatic variants in homologous recombinant genes, 
including BRCA2. Individuals possessing germline pathogenic BRCA2 variants are 
known to have a higher risk of developing various cancers, including breast, 
ovarian, pancreatic, and bile duct cancers (BDCs). It has been reported that 
tumors positive for BRCA1/2 variants are sensitive to platinum-based agents. 
Thus, BRCA1/2 germline testing and comprehensive genomic profiling are 
recommended to identify genetic susceptibility and to indicate optimal targeted 
therapy. Here, we report familial occurrence of PACC and BDC associated with 
BRCA2; both tumors responded exceptionally well to platinum-based chemotherapy. 
A 37-year-old man was diagnosed with unresectable PACC with a germline BRCA2 
variant. He was treated with oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy and conversion 
surgery, and remains alive without tumor recurrence after more than 36 months. 
His father also possessed the identical germline BRCA2 variant and was diagnosed 
with extrahepatic BDC with lymph node metastases. The tumors showed marked 
shrinkage upon treatment with cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. Our cases 
underscore the importance of comprehensive genomic profiling and genetic testing 
for BRCA2 to ensure optimal therapeutic options for PACC as well as to identify 
high-risk individuals with various cancers in the family.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of cytokine-induced killer (CIK) 
cell therapy in pancreatic cancer.
METHODS: An orthotopic murine model of pancreatic cancer and adjuvant 
therapy-mimicking xenograft murine model that underwent splenectomy was created. 
Eighty mice were randomized into four groups: the control, gemcitabine alone, 
CIK alone, and CIK with gemcitabine groups. The tumor growth was monitored using 
bioluminescence imaging once weekly.
RESULTS: In the orthotopic murine model, the treatment groups showed a 
significantly longer survival than the control group (median: not reached vs 
125.0 days; 95% confidence interval, 119.87-130.13; P = 0.04); however, the 
overall survival did not differ significantly among the treatment groups (P = 
0.779). The metastatic recurrence rate and overall survival were also not 
significantly different among the groups in the adjuvant therapy-mimicking 
xenograft murine model (P = 0.497). However, the CIK and gemcitabine combination 
suppressed the metastatic recurrence effectively, with recurrence-free survival 
being significantly longer in the CIK with gemcitabine group than in the control 
group (median, 54 days; 95% confidence interval, 25.00-102.00; P = 0.013).
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of CIK and gemcitabine suppressed systemic 
metastatic recurrence, with promising efficacy and good tolerability in an 
adjuvant setting of pancreatic cancer.

Therapeutic Targets and Prognostic Biomarkers Among CXC Chemokines in Pancreatic 
Ductal Adenocarcinoma Microenvironment.

Hospital, GuangdongAcademy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China.

OBJECTIVES: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by occult 
onset, rapid progression, and poor prognosis. CXC chemokines play an important 
role in tumor microenvironment and development. However, the potential 
mechanistic values of CXC chemokines as clinical biomarkers and therapeutic 
targets in PDAC have not been fully clarified.
METHODS: The altered expression, interaction network, and clinical data of CXC 
chemokines in patients with PDAC were analyzed by the data from the Gene 
Expression Omnibus and the Tumor Cancer Genome Atlas.
RESULTS: CXCL5 transcriptional level was significantly elevated in PDAC tissues. 
A significant correlation was found between the expression of CXC1/3/5/8 and the 
pathological stage of PDAC patients. The PDAC patients with low transcriptional 
levels of CXCL5/9/10/11/17 were associated with a significantly better 
prognosis. The functions of differentially expressed CXC chemokines are 
primarily related to the chemokine signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor 
interaction, and viral protein interaction with cytokine and cytokine receptor. 
RELA, NFKB1, and SP1 are key transcription factors for CXC chemokines, and the 
SRC family of tyrosine kinases, mitogen-activated protein kinases, CDK5, PRKCQ, 
ROCK1, ITK, IKBKE, JAK3, and NTRK2 are CXC chemokine targets.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that CXC chemokines might serve as 
therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers in PDAC.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to reinterpret the prognostic prediction of 
p53 expression categories in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with exploration 
of the relationship between TP53 mutation genotype and p53 expression pattern.
METHODS: Data were retrospectively collected from consecutive patients who 
underwent primary pancreatic resection. Complete loss of function of TP53 is 
defined as nonsense and frameshift mutations. A tissue microarray was used to 
evaluate p53 expression by immunohistochemistry and was categorized as 
regulated, high, or negative.
RESULTS: The κ coefficient for agreement between p53 expression and TP53 was 
0.761. Cox regression analyses revealed that p53 expression (high vs regulated: 
hazard ratio [HR], 2.225; P < 0.001; negative vs regulated: HR, 2.788; P < 
0.001), tumor-node-metastasis stage (II vs I: HR, 3.471; P < 0.001; III vs I: 
HR, 6.834; P < 0.001), and tumor grade (G3/4 vs G1/2: HR, 1.958; P < 0.001) were 
independent prognostic factors in developing cohort and validation cohort. In 
subgroups of stage I, II, and III, compared with regulated expression, the 
patients with negative expression had a worse prognosis in both cohorts (P < 
0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that 3-tier p53 expression in resectable 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma provided independent prognostic information 
complementary to the tumor-node-metastasis staging system and facilitated 
patient stratification for personalized therapy.

OBJECTIVES: Functional neuroendocrine tumors (FNETs) are characterized by excess 
secretion of disease-specific hormones. In this study, we attempted to define 
survival trends in patients with some of these uncommon tumors.
METHODS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, 529 
patients with FNETs (gastrinoma, insulinoma, glucagonoma, VIPoma, and 
somatostatinoma) were identified. We analyzed patient and tumor characteristics, 
overall survival, and cancer-specific survival.
RESULTS: Functional neuroendocrine tumors were found to be more predominant in 
White patients older than 50 years. Most common FNETs were gastrinoma (56.3%) 
and insulinoma (23.8%). Most FNETs were found in the pancreas, with the second 
most common location being the small bowel. Surgery was the primary modality of 
treatment, used in 55.8% of the cases. Median overall survival was 9.8 years 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 7.9-11.8) with a median cancer-specific survival 
of 18.5 years (95% CI, 12.8-24.2). In multivariate analysis, age >50 years 
(hazard ratio [HR], 2.7; 95% CI, 2.02-3.64), no surgical resection (HR, 1.88; 
95% CI, 1.43-2.46), metastasis (HR, 3.0; 95% CI, 2.0-4.5), and poor 
differentiation were associated with poor survival. Site and histology did not 
have a significant impact on survival (P = 0.82 and 0.57 respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the most important prognostic factors for 
gastrointestinal FNETs.

OBJECTIVES: The management of incidentally discovered pancreatic cystic lesions 
(PCLs) with surveillance or resection often requires shared decision-making. 
Patients with cirrhosis are more likely to have PCLs discovered due to increased 
imaging, and those undergoing liver transplantations (LTs) may be at increased 
risk of carcinogenesis due to immunosuppressive medications. Our study aimed to 
characterize the outcomes and risk of malignant progression of PCLs in post-LT 
patients.
METHODS: Multiple databases were searched for studies looking at PCLs in post-LT 
patients from inception until February 2022. Primary outcomes were the incidence 
of PCLs in LT recipients and progression to malignancy. Secondary outcomes 
included development of worrisome features, outcomes of surgical resection for 
progression, and change in size.
RESULTS: A total of 12 studies with 17,862 patients with 1411 PCLs were 
included. The pooled proportion of new PCL development in post-LT patients was 
68% (95% confidence interval [CI], 42-86; I2 = 94%) over the follow-up of 3.7 
(standard deviation, 1.5) years. The pooled progression of malignancy and 
worrisome features was 1% (95% CI, 0-2; I2 = 0%) and 4% (95% CI, 1-11; I2 = 
89%), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with nontransplant patients, incidental PCLs do not carry 
a higher risk of malignancy.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to compare the efficacy and safety of 3 
chemotherapy regimens used as first-line treatments in the real-life management 
of metastatic pancreatic cancer.
METHODS: A total of 218 patients were included in this multicenter study. 
Gemcitabine (Gem, n = 71), gemcitabine-cisplatin (Gem-Cis, n = 91), and 
FOLFIRINOX (a combination of leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan, and 
oxaliplatin [FFX], n = 56) treatments were compared.
RESULTS: Overall response rate was significantly higher in the FFX group (50.0%) 
than in the Gem (28.2%) and Gem-Cis (27.5%) groups (P = 0.010). Median 
progression-free survival (8.4 vs 4.6 and 5.5 months, respectively, P < 0.001) 
and overall survival (16.4 vs 8.1 and 8.7 months, respectively, P = 0.002) were 
significantly longer in the FFX group than in the Gem and Gem-Cis groups. 
Toxicity of any grade was noted in 46 (64.8%), 56 (61.5%), and 49 (87.5%) 
patients in the Gem, Gem-Cis, and FFX groups, respectively (P = 0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: In our study, FFX regimen provides a significant advantage over the 
other treatment regimens in terms of response rates and survival. Treatment 
toxicity was more frequent but manageable with the FFX regimen.

OBJECTIVES: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with strong expression of 
interleukin-13 receptor α2 (IL-13Rα2) was associated with poor prognosis and 
gemcitabine resistance in an orthotopic mouse model. We evaluated the influence 
of IL-13Rα2 expression in the endoscopic ultrasound-fine needle aspiration 
(EUS-FNA) specimen.
METHODS: We included patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, as 
diagnosed by EUS-FNA, who received gemcitabine-based chemotherapy (G-CTX). Tumor 
expression of IL-13Rα2 was assessed by immunohistochemistry and classified using 
a three scale (negative, weak, or strong) in a blinded fashion. The effect of 
G-CTX was assessed by tumor reduction rate by computed tomography after 3 
months.
RESULTS: A total of 95 patients were enrolled, and 63 and 32 cases were 
determined with strong and weak/negative expression of IL-13Rα2. The 
IL-13Rα2-strong group showed significantly poorer progression-free and overall 
survival rates than weak/negative group (P = 0.0191 and P = 0.0062, 
respectively). Strong expression of IL-13Rα2 was associated with progression 
factor after 3 months of the first G-CTX (odds ratio, 13.72; P = 0.0143).
CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with strong expression of IL-13Rα2 
in EUS-FNA specimens showed poor prognosis and poor response to G-CTX.

OBJECTIVES: To analyze whether use of proton pump inhibitors increase the risk 
for pancreatic cancer in a mouse model and human clinical cohorts.
METHODS: p48-Cre/LSL-KrasG12D mice that develop precancerous pancreatic 
intraepithelial neoplasia (PanINs) were treated with low- or high-dose proton 
pump inhibitors (PPIs) orally for 1 and 4 months. The mechanism for the 
cholecystokinin receptor 2 (CCK-2R) activation was investigated in vitro. Two 
resources were employed to analyze the risk of pancreatic cancer in human 
subjects with PPI use.
RESULTS: Serum gastrin levels were increased 8-fold (P < 0.0001) in mice treated 
with chronic high-dose PPIs, and this change correlated with an increase (P = 
0.02) in PanIN grade and the development of microinvasive cancer. The CCK-2R 
expression was regulated by microRNA-148a in the p48-Cre/LSL-KrasG12D mice 
pancreas and in human pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. Proton pump inhibitor 
consumption in human subjects was correlated with pancreatic cancer risk (odds 
ratio, 1.54). A validation analysis conducted using the large-scale United 
Kingdom Biobank database confirmed the correlation (odds ratio, 1.9; P = 
0.00761) of pancreatic cancer risk with PPI exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: This investigation revealed in both murine models and human 
subjects, PPI use is correlated with a risk for development of pancreatic 
cancer.

Clinically Relevant Biology of Hyaluronic Acid in the Desmoplastic Stroma of 
Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is notorious for its poor outcome. The 
presence of a dense desmoplastic stroma is a hallmark of this malignancy, and 
abundant hyaluronic acid (HA) within this stroma is a common feature of PDAC. At 
the end of 2019, an HA-targeting drug, after initial promise, failed phase 3 
clinical trials in PDAC. This failure in the face of such strong evidence for 
biological importance forces us to turn back to the research and seek a better 
understanding of HA biology in PDAC. Therefore, in this review, we reexamine 
what is known about HA biology, the methods used to detect and quantify HA, and 
the ability of the biological models in which HA has been investigated to 
recapitulate an HA-rich desmoplastic tumor stroma. The role of HA in PDAC relies 
on its complex interplay with a range of HA-associated molecules, which have not 
been as extensively investigated as HA itself. Therefore, using large genomic 
data sets, we cataloged the abundance and activity in PDAC of molecules that 
modulate HA synthesis, degradation, protein interactions, and receptor binding. 
Based on their association with clinical characteristics and individual patient 
outcomes, we suggest a small number of HA-associated molecules that warrant 
further investigation as biomarkers and drug targets.

Defining the Optimal Duration of Neoadjuvant Therapy for Pancreatic Ductal 
Adenocarcinoma: Time for a Personalized Approach?

Despite recent advances, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) continues to be 
associated with dismal outcomes, with a cure evading most patients. While 
historic treatment for PDAC has been surgical resection followed by 6 months of 
adjuvant therapy, there has been a recent shift toward neoadjuvant treatment 
(NAT). Several considerations support this approach, including the 
characteristic early systemic spread of PDAC, and the morbidity often 
surrounding pancreatic resection, which can delay recovery and preclude patients 
from starting adjuvant treatment. The addition of NAT has been suggested to 
improve margin-negative resection rates, decrease lymph node positivity, and 
potentially translate to improved survival. Conversely, complications and 
disease progression can occur during preoperative treatment, potentially 
eliminating the chance of curative resection. As NAT utilization has increased, 
treatment durations have been found to vary widely between institutions with an 
optimal duration remaining undefined. In this review, we assess the existing 
literature on NAT for PDAC, reviewing treatment durations reported across 
retrospective case series and prospective clinical trials to establish currently 
used approaches and seek the optimal duration. We also analyze markers of 
treatment response and review the potential for personalized approaches that may 
help clarify this important treatment question and move NAT toward a more 
standardized approach.

Challenges in Recruitment and Retention: Leveraging Health-Related Antecedents 
and Information Carrier Factors to Improve Patient Participation in Pancreatic 
Cancer Research-A Review Article.

Coffin TB(1), Kenner BJ.

Advancements in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) prevention, diagnosis, 
and treatment rely on representative and robust clinical trial participation. 
Given the severity of PDAC, along with the lack of effective early detection 
approaches, the need for accessible screening tools and new treatments is dire. 
Unfortunately, enrollment barriers often result in low participant accrual rates 
for PDAC studies and illustrate the challenging terrain researchers are facing. 
Research participation along with access to preventative care has been further 
impacted by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. In this review, we use the 
Comprehensive Model for Information Seeking to discuss underexplored factors 
that influence patient participation in clinical studies. Adequate staffing, 
flexible scheduling, effective patient and physician communication, and 
culturally responsive messaging, along with the use of telehealth, can support 
enrollment objectives. Clinical research studies are a key component of health 
care, informing medical advancements, and improving outcomes. By leveraging 
health-related antecedents and information carrier factors, researchers can more 
effectively address barriers to participation and implement potential 
evidence-based mitigating strategies. While this work focuses on the PDAC 
research context, the lessons delineated here are applicable to the wider cancer 
research setting.

The "Integrated Physiology of the Exocrine and Endocrine Compartments in 
Pancreatic Diseases" Workshop was a 1.5-day scientific conference at the 
National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD) that engaged clinical and basic 
science investigators interested in diseases of the pancreas. This report 
summarizes the workshop proceedings. The goal of the workshop was to forge 
connections and identify gaps in knowledge that could guide future research 
directions. Presentations were segregated into 6 major themes, including (a) 
Pancreas Anatomy and Physiology; (b) Diabetes in the Setting of Exocrine 
Disease; (c) Metabolic Influences on the Exocrine Pancreas; (d) Genetic Drivers 
of Pancreatic Diseases; (e) Tools for Integrated Pancreatic Analysis; and (f) 
Implications of Exocrine-Endocrine Crosstalk. For each theme, there were 
multiple presentations followed by panel discussions on specific topics relevant 
to each area of research; these are summarized herein. Significantly, the 
discussions resulted in the identification of research gaps and opportunities 
for the field to address. In general, it was concluded that as a pancreas 
research community, we must more thoughtfully integrate our current knowledge of 
the normal physiology as well as the disease mechanisms that underlie endocrine 
and exocrine disorders so that there is a better understanding of the interplay 
between these compartments.

BACKGROUND: The European registry for minimally invasive pancreatic surgery 
(E-MIPS) collects data on laparoscopic and robotic MIPS in low- and high-volume 
centers across Europe.
METHODS: Analysis of the first year (2019) of the E-MIPS registry, including 
minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy (MIDP) and minimally invasive 
pancreatoduodenectomy (MIPD). Primary outcome was 90-day mortality.
RESULTS: Overall, 959 patients from 54 centers in 15 countries were included, 
558 patients underwent MIDP and 401 patients MIPD. Median volume of MIDP was 10 
(7-20) and 9 (2-20) for MIPD. Median use of MIDP was 56.0% (IQR 39.0-77.3%) and 
median use of MIPD 27.7% (IQR 9.7-45.3%). MIDP was mostly performed laparoscopic 
(401/558, 71.9%) and MIPD mostly robotic (234/401, 58.3%). MIPD was performed in 
50/54 (89.3%) centers, of which 15/50 (30.0%) performed ≥20 MIPD annually. This 
was 30/54 (55.6%) centers and 13/30 (43%) centers for MIPD respectively. 
Conversion rate was 10.9% for MIDP and 8.4% for MIPD. Overall 90 day mortality 
was 1.1% (n = 6) for MIDP and 3.7% (n = 15) for MIPD.
CONCLUSION: Within the E-MIPS registry, MIDP is performed in about half of all 
patients, mostly using laparoscopy. MIPD is performed in about a quarter of 
patients, slightly more often using the robotic approach. A minority of centers 
met the Miami guideline volume criteria for MIPD.

Pancreatic gastrointestinal tumour is an unusual primary tumour of the pancreas. 
A 31-year-old male came to the clinic with jaundice and weight loss. 
Cross-sectional imaging showed a mass in the pancreatic uncinate process. 
Image-guided biopsy revealed gastrointestinal stromal tumour, so 
pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed, followed by adjuvant Imatinib. The 
patient had oligo-metastasis in the liver five years post-surgery and underwent 
liver resection. This is an unusual case where a pancreatic GIST presented with 
metastasis while on adjuvant treatment. Hepatectomy and multimodal therapy 
increases the survival if the disease is confined to the liver.

Market drugs, such as Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or European Medicines 
Agency (EMA)-approved drugs for specific indications provide opportunities for 
repurposing for newer therapeutics. This potentially saves resources invested in 
clinical trials that verify drug safety and tolerance in humans prior to 
alternative indication approval. Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) 
overexpression has been linked to promoting the tumor phenotype in several 
cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), colorectal cancer 
(CRC), and breast cancer (BC), making PRMT5 an important target for cancer 
therapy. Previously, we showed that PRMT5-mediated methylation of the nuclear 
factor (NF)-κB, partially contributes to its constitutive activation observed in 
cancers. In this study, we utilized an AlphaLISA-based high-throughput screening 
method adapted in our lab, and identified one FDA-approved drug, Candesartan 
cilexetil (Can, used in hypertension treatment) and one EMA-approved drug, 
Cloperastine hydrochloride (Clo, used in cough treatment) that had significant 
PRMT5-inhibitory activity, and their anti-tumor properties were validated using 
cancer phenotypic assays in vitro. Furthermore, PRMT5 selective inhibition of 
methyltransferase activity was confirmed by reduction of both NF-κB methylation 
and its subsequent activation upon drug treatment. Using in silico prediction, 
we identified critical residues on PRMT5 targeted by these drugs that may 
interfere with its enzymatic activity. Finally, Clo and Can treatment have 
exhibited marked reduction in tumor growth in vivo. Overall, we provide basis 
for pursuing repurposing Clo and Can as anti-PRMT5 cancer therapies. Our study 
offers potential safe and fast repurposing of previously unknown PRMT5 
inhibitors into clinical practice.

AIM: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of uncooled TATO microwave ablation 
(MWA) for primary and metastatic liver cancer.
MATERIALS & METHODS: This was a retrospective study on percutaneous liver 
ablations performed with TATO MWA. Twenty-five ablations were performed; 11 
(44%) were performed for hepatocellular carcinoma, 14 (56%) for colorectal 
carcinoma, gastric and pancreatic metastases.
RESULTS: Adverse events were reported only in one (4%) ablation: an abscess that 
was observed in the ablated area and was resolved with a percutaneous drainage 
and antibiotic therapy. Local tumor control rate was 92% at the 3-month 
follow-up.
CONCLUSION: TATO MWA was safe and effective with high reproducibility in 
treating primary and secondary liver cancer with satisfactory technical and 
clinical outcomes.

Plain Language Summary: The removal of cancer from the liver or liver metastases 
from cancers in distant sites can be performed safely and effectively with a 
system that uses a microwave generator (TATO) that allows a good visibility of 
ablation procedure under intraprocedural real-time ultrasound imaging.

AIM: This study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of a multidisciplinary 
approach incorporating neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with S1 (S1-NACRT) for 
resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
METHODS: The medical records of 132 patients who received S1-NACRT for 
resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma from 2010 to 2019 were reviewed. The 
S1-NACRT regimen consisted of S1 at a dose of 80-120 mg/body/day together with 
1.8 Gy of radiation in 28 fractions. The patients were re-evaluated 4 weeks 
after S1-NACRT completion, and a pancreatectomy was then considered.
RESULTS: Adverse events of S1-NACRT ≥grade 3 occurred in 22.7% of the patients, 
and 1.5% discontinued therapy. Of the 112 patients who underwent a 
pancreatectomy, 109 underwent R0 resection. Adjuvant chemotherapy with relative 
dose intensity ≥50% was administered to 74.1% of the patients who underwent 
resection. The median overall survival of all patients was 47 months, and the 
median overall survival and recurrence-free survival of patients who underwent 
resection was 71 and 32 months, respectively. According to the multivariate 
analyses of prognostic factors for overall survival in patients who underwent 
resection, negative margin status (hazard ratio: 0.182; P = 0.006) and relative 
dose intensity of adjuvant chemotherapy ≥50% (hazard ratio 0.294; P < 0.001) 
were independent prognostic factors of overall survival.
CONCLUSIONS: A multidisciplinary approach incorporating S1-NACRT for resectable 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma demonstrated acceptable tolerability and good 
local control and resulted in comparable survival benefits.

Expression of the Notch family of receptors is often upregulated in pancreatic 
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In this study, we focused on Notch4, which had not 
been investigated in PDAC. We generated KC (LSL-KrasG12D;p48-Cre), N4 - / - KC 
(Notch4- / -;LSL-KrasG12D;p48-Cre), PKC (p16fl/fl;LSL-KrasG12D;p48-Cre), and N4 
- / - PKC (Notch4-/ -; p16fl/f l;LSL-KrasG12D;p48-Cre) genetically engineered 
mouse models (GEMM). We performed caerulein treatment in both KC and N4 - / - KC 
mice, and the development of acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) and pancreatic 
intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) lesions were significantly diminished in the 
N4 - / - KC than in the KC GEMM (P = 0.01). This in vivo result was validated by 
in vitro ADM induction of the explant cultures of pancreatic acinar cells from 
the N4 - / - KC and KC mice (P < 0.001), confirming that Notch4 is an important 
contributor to early pancreatic tumorigenesis. To evaluate the role of Notch4 in 
the later stage of pancreatic tumorigenesis, we compared the PKC and N4 - / - 
PKC mice. The N4 - / - PKC mice had better overall survival (P = 0.012) and 
significantly reduced tumor burden (PanIN: P = 0.018 at 2 months, PDAC: P = 
0.039 at 5 months) compared with the PKC GEMM. RNA-sequencing analysis of 
pancreatic tumor cell lines derived from the PKC and N4 - / - PKC GEMMs revealed 
that 408 genes were differentially expressed (FDR < 0.05) and Pcsk5 is a 
potential downstream effector of the Notch4 signaling pathway (P < 0.001). Low 
expression of Pcsk5 positively correlates with good survival in patients with 
PDAC (P = 0.028). We have identified a novel role for Notch4 signaling with 
tumor-promoting function in pancreatic tumorigenesis. Our study also uncovered a 
novel association between Pcsk5 and Notch4 signaling in PDAC.
SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrated that global inactivation of Notch4 significantly 
improved the survival of an aggressive mouse model for PDAC and provided 
preclinical evidence that Notch4 and Pcsk5 are novel targets for PDAC therapies.

Lipid-formulated RNA vaccines have been widely used for disease prevention and 
treatment, yet their mechanism of action and individual components contributing 
to such actions remain to be delineated. Here, we show that a therapeutic cancer 
vaccine composed of a protamine/mRNA core and a lipid shell is highly potent in 
promoting cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses and mediating anti-tumor immunity. 
Mechanistically, both the mRNA core and lipid shell are needed to fully 
stimulate the expression of type I interferons and inflammatory cytokines in 
dendritic cells. Stimulation of interferon-β expression is exclusively dependent 
on STING, and antitumor activity from the mRNA vaccine is significantly 
compromised in mice with a defective Sting gene. Thus, the mRNA vaccine elicits 
STING-dependent antitumor immunity.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Preclinical activity was tested in patient-derived 
xenograft (PDX) models of PDAC. In the open-label, phase I clinical study, the 
dose-escalation cohort received oral palbociclib initially at 75 mg/day (range, 
50‒125 mg/day; modified 3+3 design; 3/1 schedule); intravenous nab-paclitaxel 
was administered weekly for 3 weeks/28-day cycle at 100‒125 mg/m2. The modified 
dose-regimen cohorts received palbociclib 75 mg/day (3/1 schedule or 
continuously) plus nab-paclitaxel (biweekly 125 or 100 mg/m2, respectively). The 
prespecified efficacy threshold was 12-month survival probability of ≥65% at the 
MTD.
RESULTS: Palbociclib plus nab-paclitaxel was more effective than gemcitabine 
plus nab-paclitaxel in three of four PDX models tested; the combination was not 
inferior to paclitaxel plus gemcitabine. In the clinical trial, 76 patients (80% 
received prior treatment for advanced disease) were enrolled. Four dose-limiting 
toxicities were observed [mucositis (n = 1), neutropenia (n = 2), febrile 
neutropenia (n = 1)]. The MTD was palbociclib 100 mg for 21 of every 28 days and 
nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks in a 28-day cycle. Among all 
patients, the most common all-causality any-grade adverse events were 
neutropenia (76.3%), asthenia/fatigue (52.6%), nausea (42.1%), and anemia 
(40.8%). At the MTD (n = 27), the 12-month survival probability was 50% (95% 
confidence interval, 29.9-67.2).
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed the tolerability and antitumor activity of 
palbociclib plus nab-paclitaxel treatment in patients with PDAC; however, the 
prespecified efficacy threshold was not met.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: Pfizer Inc (NCT02501902).
SIGNIFICANCE: In this article, the combination of palbociclib, a CDK4/6 
inhibitor, and nab-paclitaxel in advanced pancreatic cancer evaluates an 
important drug combination using translational science. In addition, the work 
presented combines preclinical and clinical data along with pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamic assessments to find alternative treatments for this patient 
population.

The treatment of metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is 
frequently characterized by significant toxicity and rapid development of 
resistance to current approved therapies. More reliable biomarkers of response 
are needed to guide clinical decision making. We evaluated cell-free DNA (cfDNA) 
using a tumor-agnostic platform and traditional biomarkers (CEA and CA19-9) 
levels in 12 patients treated at Johns Hopkins University on NCT02324543 "Study 
of Gemcitabine/Nab-Paclitaxel/Xeloda (GAX) in Combination With Cisplatin and 
Irinotecan in Subjects With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer." The pretreatment 
values, levels after 2 months of treatment, and change in biomarker levels with 
treatment were compared with clinical outcomes to determine their predictive 
value. The variant allele frequency (VAF) of KRAS and TP53 mutations in cfDNA 
after 2 months of treatment was predictive of progression-free survival (PFS) 
and overall survival (OS). In particular, patients with a lower-than-average 
KRAS VAF after 2 months of treatment had a substantially longer PFS than 
patients with higher posttreatment KRAS VAF (20.96 vs. 4.39 months). Changes in 
CEA and CA19-9 after 2 months of treatment were also good predictors of PFS. 
Comparison via concordance index demonstrated KRAS or TP53 VAF after 2 months of 
treatment to be better predictors of PFS and OS than CA19-9 or CEA. This pilot 
study requires validation but suggests cfDNA measurement is a useful adjunct to 
traditional protein biomarkers and imaging evaluation and could distinguish 
between patients who are likely to achieve prolonged responses versus those that 
will have early progression and may benefit from a change in treatment approach.
SIGNIFICANCE: We report on the association of cfDNA with response durability for 
patients undergoing treatment with a novel metronomic chemotherapy regimen 
(gemcitabine, nab-paclitaxel, capecitabine, cisplatin, irinotecan; GAX-CI) for 
metastatic PDAC. This investigation offers encouraging evidence that cfDNA may 
prove to be a valuable diagnostic tool to guide clinical management.

Not all populations are poised to benefit from advancing genomics in 
gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NEN), as genomics have 
focused on White patients. This study aimed to evaluate racial populations 
represented in genomic studies of GEP-NENs and to provide evidence of 
differential genomic findings between racial groups in GEP-NENs. Manuscripts 
analyzing DNA, RNA, or DNA methylation in GEP-NENs were queried using PUBMED and 
EMBASE. NIH race/ethnicity term frequency was then determined by Natural 
Language Processing, followed by manual evaluation of tumor types and subjects 
by racial group. IHC of institutional tissue micro-arrays and analysis of AACR 
GENIE data analyzed was performed to determine mutational differences between 
Black and White pancreatic NEN (pNEN) patients. 313 manuscripts conducted the 
requisite genomic analyses, 16 of which included subject race data. Race data 
were included in 13/184 DNA, 4/107 RNA, and 1/54 DNA Methylation analyses. These 
studies included 89% White subjects (n = 2032), 5.8% Asian subjects (n = 132), 
4.0% "Other" subjects (n = 93), and 1.2% Black subjects (n = 27). No Native 
American/Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, or ethnically 
Hispanic/Latinx subjects were represented. There were significant differences in 
MEN1 mutations among Black and White patients in immunohistochemical (13:40) and 
GENIE data (24:268 patients per group, respectively), with 9 additional genes 
differentially mutated in the GENIE dataset. Genomic sequencing data for 
GEP-NENs is almost racially homogenous. Differences in pNEN genomics may exist 
between racial groups, highlighting a need for diversity in future genomic 
analyses of GEP-NENs to understand the putative influence of interracial genomic 
variation on GEP-NEN prevention, diagnosis, and therapy.
SIGNIFICANCE: There is little diversity in genomic studies of GEP-NENs, which 
may exhibit clinically impactful variation in their tumor biology among racial 
groups. Improved diversity in such studies is imperative for understanding this 
variation and its potential impacts on disease prevention, diagnosis, 
therapeutic targeting, and clinical outcomes.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a 5-year survival rate below 5%. 
Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) is the most commonly used blood-based 
biomarker for PDAC in current clinical practice, despite having been shown 
repeatedly to be inaccurate and have poor diagnostic performance. This review 
aims to assess the reported diagnostic accuracy of all blood-based biomarkers 
investigated to date in PDAC, by directly comparing individual biomarkers and 
multi-biomarker panels, both containing CA19-9 and not (novel). A systematic 
review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA standards in July 2020. 
Individualized search strategies for three academic databases identified 5,885 
studies between the years 1973 and 2020. After two rounds of screening, 250 
studies were included. Data were extracted and assessed for bias. A multivariate 
three-level meta-analysis with subgroup moderators was run in R using AUC values 
as effect size. On the basis of this model, the pooled AUC value for all 
multi-biomarker panels (AUC = 0.898; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.88-0.91) 
was significantly higher than all single biomarkers (AUC = 0.803; 95% CI: 
0.78-0.83; P < 0.0001). The pooled AUC value for CA19-9 alone was significantly 
lower compared with the multi-biomarker panels containing CA19-9 (P < 0.0001). 
For the novel biomarkers, the pooled AUC for single biomarkers was also 
significantly lower compared with multi-biomarker panels (P < 0.0001). Novel 
biomarkers that have been repeatedly examined across the literature, such as 
TIMP-1, CEA, and CA125, are highlighted as promising. These results suggest that 
CA19-9 may be best used as an addition to a panel of biomarkers rather than 
alone, and that multi-biomarker panels generate the most robust results in 
blood-based PDAC diagnosis.
SIGNIFICANCE: In a systematic review and three-level multivariate meta-analysis, 
it is shown for the first time that blood-based multi-biomarker panels for the 
diagnosis of PDAC exhibit superior performance in comparison with single 
biomarkers. CA19-9 is demonstrated to have limited utility alone, and to perform 
poorly in patient control cohorts of both healthy and benign individuals. 
Multi-biomarker panels containing CA19-9 produce the best diagnostic performance 
overall.

PARP inhibitors (PARPi) are currently indicated for the treatment of ovarian, 
breast, pancreatic, and prostate cancers harboring mutations in the tumor 
suppressor genes BRCA1 or BRCA2. In the case of ovarian and prostate cancers, 
their classification as homologous recombination repair (HRR) deficient (HRD) or 
mutated also makes PARPi an available treatment option beyond BRCA1 or BRCA2 
mutational status. However, identification of the most relevant genetic 
alterations driving the HRD phenotype has proven difficult and recent data have 
shown that other genetic alterations not affecting HRR are also capable of 
driving PARPi responses. To gain insight into the genetics driving PARPi 
sensitivity, we performed CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screens in six 
PARPi-insensitive cell lines and combined the output with published PARPi 
datasets from eight additional cell lines. Ensuing exploration of the data 
identified 110 genes whose inactivation is strongly linked to sensitivity to 
PARPi. Parallel cell line generation of isogenic gene knockouts in ovarian and 
prostate cancer cell lines identified that inactivation of core HRR factors is 
required for driving in vitro PARPi responses comparable with the ones observed 
for BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. Moreover, pan-cancer genetic, transcriptomic, and 
epigenetic data analyses of these 110 genes highlight the ones most frequently 
inactivated in tumors, making this study a valuable resource for prospective 
identification of potential PARPi-responsive patient populations. Importantly, 
our investigations uncover XRCC3 gene silencing as a potential new prognostic 
biomarker of PARPi sensitivity in prostate cancer.
SIGNIFICANCE: This study identifies tumor genetic backgrounds where to expand 
the use of PARPis beyond mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2. This is achieved by 
combining the output of unbiased genome-wide loss-of-function CRISPR-Cas9 
genetic screens with bioinformatics analysis of biallelic losses of the 
identified genes in public tumor datasets, unveiling loss of the DNA repair gene 
XRCC3 as a potential biomarker of PARPi sensitivity in prostate cancer.

The following is a technical report of the successful cryoablation of pancreatic 
metastasis originating from follicular thyroid carcinoma. The patient was a 
72-year-old female who underwent total thyroidectomy and radioiodine ablation 
for follicular carcinoma. One year after surgery, a positron emission 
tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) examination, performed to demonstrate 
the source of the increased thyroglobulin, showed a fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) 
avid mass located in the body of the pancreas. A percutaneous tru-cut biopsy was 
performed that revealed follicular thyroid carcinoma metastasis to the pancreas. 
Because of the patient's comorbidities, the patient underwent percutaneous 
cryoablation and made a successful recovery over the following 13 months. At the 
most recent follow-up, the thyroglobulin level was undetectable, and a PET-CT 
scan showed no FDG avid mass in the pancreas. To our knowledge, follicular 
carcinoma metastasis of the pancreas is extremely rare, and this is the first 
report of successful cryoablation of a metastatic tumor in the pancreas.

A patient showed signs of fever and Hemovac insertion site discharge 8 days 
after surgery and was admitted. Abdominal paracentesis found milky ascites with 
triglyceride levels of the peritoneal fluid as high as 1,603 g/mL. Diagnosed as 
chylous ascites, symptomatic therapy such as empirical antibodies and diuretics 
was administered with paracentesis before being discharged. The ascites volume 
increased again, and the patient was re-admitted. The patient was treated with 
orlistat, octreotide, total parenteral nutrition administration, ascites 
drainage, and diuretics. Ascites levels increased further and intraperitoneal 
Viscum was administered. Clear ascites was observed, and the patient was 
discharged. We reported a case where conventional treatment for chylous ascites 
that occurred after pancreaticoduodenectomy was shown to be ineffective while 
Viscum extracted from mistletoe was able to manage chylous ascites.

Pancreatic cancer remains a disease with unmet clinical needs and inadequate 
diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers. In-depth characterization of 
the disease proteome is limited. This study thus aims to define and describe 
protein networks underlying pancreatic cancer and identify protein centric 
subtypes with clinical relevance. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics was used to 
identify and quantify the proteome in tumor tissue, tumor-adjacent tissue, and 
patient-derived xenografts (PDX)-derived cell lines from patients with 
pancreatic cancer, and tissues from patients with chronic pancreatitis. We 
identified, quantified, and characterized 11,634 proteins from 72 pancreatic 
tissue samples. Network focused analysis of the proteomics data led to 
identification of a tumor epithelium-specific module and an extracellular matrix 
(ECM)-associated module that discriminated pancreatic tumor tissue from both 
tumor adjacent tissue and pancreatitis tissue. On the basis of the ECM module, 
we defined an ECM-high and an ECM-low subgroup, where the ECM-high subgroup was 
associated with poor prognosis (median survival months: 15.3 vs. 22.9 months; 
log-rank test, P = 0.02). The ECM-high tumors were characterized by elevated 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition and glycolytic activities, and low oxidative 
phosphorylation, E2F, and DNA repair pathway activities. This study offers novel 
insights into the protein network underlying pancreatic cancer opening up for 
proteome precision medicine development.
SIGNIFICANCE: Pancreatic cancer lacks reliable biomarkers for prognostication 
and treatment of patients. We analyzed the proteome of pancreatic tumors, 
nonmalignant tissues of the pancreas and PDX-derived cell lines, and identified 
proteins that discriminate between patients with good and poor survival. The 
proteomics data also unraveled potential novel drug targets.

Wnt signaling is implicated in the etiology of gastrointestinal tract cancers. 
Targeting Wnt signaling is challenging due to on-target toxicity concerns and 
lack of druggable pathway components. We describe the discovery and 
characterization of RXC004, a potent and selective inhibitor of the 
membrane-bound o-acyl transferase Porcupine, essential for Wnt ligand secretion. 
Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion and safety pharmacology 
studies were conducted with RXC004 in vitro, and pharmacokinetic exposure 
assessed in vivo. RXC004 effects on proliferation and tumor metabolism were 
explored in genetically defined colorectal and pancreatic cancer models in vitro 
and in vivo. RXC004 effects on immune evasion were assessed in B16F10 immune 
"cold" and CT26 immune "hot" murine syngeneic models, and in human cell 
cocultures. RXC004 showed a promising pharmacokinetic profile, inhibited Wnt 
ligand palmitoylation, secretion, and pathway activation, and demonstrated 
potent antiproliferative effects in Wnt ligand-dependent (RNF43-mutant or 
RSPO3-fusion) colorectal and pancreatic cell lines. Reduced tumor growth and 
increased cancer cell differentiation were observed in SNU-1411 (RSPO3-fusion), 
AsPC1 and HPAF-II (both RNF43-mutant) xenograft models, with a therapeutic 
window versus Wnt homeostatic functions. Additional effects of RXC004 on tumor 
cell metabolism were confirmed in vitro and in vivo by glucose uptake and 
18fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, respectively. RXC004 stimulated host tumor immunity; 
reducing resident myeloid-derived suppressor cells within B16F10 tumors and 
synergizing with anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) to increase 
CD8+/regulatory T cell ratios within CT26 tumors. Moreover, RXC004 reversed the 
immunosuppressive effects of HPAF-II cells cocultured with human peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells, confirming the multiple anticancer mechanisms of this 
compound, which has progressed into phase II clinical trials.
SIGNIFICANCE: Wnt pathway dysregulation drives many gastrointestinal cancers; 
however, there are no approved therapies that target the pathway. RXC004 has 
demonstrated the potential to block both tumor growth and tumor immune evasion 
in a genetically defined, clinically actionable subpopulation of Wnt 
ligand-dependent gastrointestinal cancers. The clinical utility of RXC004, and 
other Porcupine inhibitors, in such Wnt ligand-dependent cancers is currently 
being assessed in patient trials.

OBJECTIVE: Intercellular communication within pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 
(PDAC) dramatically contributes to metastatic processes. The underlying 
mechanisms are poorly understood, resulting in a lack of targeted therapy to 
counteract stromal-induced cancer cell aggressiveness. Here, we investigated 
whether ion channels, which remain understudied in cancer biology, contribute to 
intercellular communication in PDAC.
DESIGN: We evaluated the effects of conditioned media from patient-derived 
cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) on electrical features of pancreatic cancer 
cells (PCC). The molecular mechanisms were deciphered using a combination of 
electrophysiology, bioinformatics, molecular and biochemistry techniques in cell 
lines and human samples. An orthotropic mouse model where CAF and PCC were 
co-injected was used to evaluate tumour growth and metastasis dissemination. 
Pharmacological studies were carried out in the Pdx1-Cre, Ink4afl/fl 
LSL-KrasG12D (KICpdx1) mouse model.
RESULTS: We report that the K+ channel SK2 expressed in PCC is stimulated by 
CAF-secreted cues (8.84 vs 2.49 pA/pF) promoting the phosphorylation of the 
channel through an integrin-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-AKT (Protein 
kinase B) axis. SK2 stimulation sets a positive feedback on the signalling 
pathway, increasing invasiveness in vitro (threefold) and metastasis formation 
in vivo. The CAF-dependent formation of the signalling hub associating SK2 and 
AKT requires the sigma-1 receptor chaperone. The pharmacological targeting of 
Sig-1R abolished CAF-induced activation of SK2, reduced tumour progression and 
extended the overall survival in mice (11.7 weeks vs 9.5 weeks).
CONCLUSION: We establish a new paradigm in which an ion channel shifts the 
activation level of a signalling pathway in response to stromal cues, opening a 
new therapeutic window targeting the formation of ion channel-dependent 
signalling hubs.

INTRODUCTION: Tislelizumab (anti-programmed cell death protein 1 antibody) 
showed preliminary antitumor activity and tolerability in patients with advanced 
solid tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to 
assess the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab in patients with previously 
treated advanced HCC.
METHODS: The multiregional phase 2 study RATIONALE-208 examined single-agent 
tislelizumab (200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks) in patients with advanced HCC 
with Child-Pugh A, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B or C, and who had 
received one or more prior lines of systemic therapy. The primary endpoint was 
objective response rate (ORR), radiologically confirmed per Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 by the Independent Review Committee. Safety 
was assessed in patients who received ≥1 dose of tislelizumab.
RESULTS: Between April 9, 2018, and February 27, 2019, 249 eligible patients 
were enrolled and treated. After a median study follow-up of 12.7 months, ORR 
was 13% (n = 32/249; 95% confidence interval [CI], 9-18), including five 
complete and 27 partial responses. The number of prior lines of therapy did not 
impact ORR (one prior line, 13% [95% CI, 8-20]; two or more prior lines, 13% 
[95% CI, 7-20]). Median duration of response was not reached. The disease 
control rate was 53%, and median overall survival was 13.2 months. Of the 249 
total patients, grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events were reported in 38 
(15%) patients; the most common was liver transaminase elevations in 10 (4%) 
patients. Treatment-related adverse events led to treatment discontinuation in 
13 (5%) patients or dose delay in 46 (19%) patients. No deaths were attributed 
to the treatment per investigator assessment.
CONCLUSION: Tislelizumab demonstrated durable objective responses, regardless of 
the number of prior lines of therapy, and acceptable tolerability in patients 
with previously treated advanced HCC.

INTRODUCTION: In the Phase 3 IMbrave150 trial (NCT03434379), atezolizumab + 
bevacizumab demonstrated a clinically meaningful survival benefit over sorafenib 
in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), including those 
with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We used 
IMbrave150 data to investigate the safety and risk of viral reactivation or 
flare in infected patients treated with atezolizumab + bevacizumab or sorafenib.
METHODS: Patients with unresectable HCC not previously treated with systemic 
therapy were randomized 2:1 to atezolizumab + bevacizumab or sorafenib. In this 
exploratory analysis, safety was continually evaluated, including for hepatic 
adverse events. Patients were monitored for HBV and HCV reactivation and flare 
at screening, the beginning of Cycles 5 and 9, and at treatment discontinuation.
RESULTS: Of 501 enrolled patients, 485 were included in the safety population; 
329 (68%) received atezolizumab + bevacizumab, and 156 (32%) received sorafenib. 
Overall, 150 (31%) and 58 (12%) patients had HBV and HCV infections, 
respectively. The safety profiles of atezolizumab + bevacizumab and sorafenib 
were consistent across patients, regardless of viral infection. Overall, hepatic 
serious adverse events occurred in 11% of patients receiving atezolizumab + 
bevacizumab and 8% receiving sorafenib. HBV or HCV reactivation occurred in 2% 
or 16% of atezolizumab + bevacizumab-treated patients, respectively, versus 7% 
or 14% with sorafenib. There were no instances of hepatitis flare with 
atezolizumab + bevacizumab.
CONCLUSIONS: Atezolizumab + bevacizumab had a similar hepatic safety profile in 
patients with and without HBV or HCV infection. Viral reactivation rates were 
similar between arms. Overall, these data support the use of atezolizumab + 
bevacizumab in patients with HCC and HBV or HCV infection without any special 
precaution.

INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to compare the prognostic impact of laparoscopic 
left hepatectomy (LLH) with that of open left hepatectomy (OLH) on patient 
survival after resection of left hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
METHODS: Among the 953 patients who received initial treatment for primary HCC 
that was resectable by either LLH or OLH from 2013 to 2017 in Japan and Korea, 
146 patients underwent LLH and 807 underwent OLH. The inverse probability of 
treatment weighting approach based on propensity scoring was used to address the 
potential selection bias inherent in the recurrence and survival outcomes 
between the LLH and OLH groups.
RESULTS: The occurrence rate of postoperative complications and hepatic 
decompensation was significantly lower in the LLH group than in the OLH group. 
Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was better in the LLH group than in the OLH group 
(hazard ratio, 1.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.71; p = 0.029), whereas 
overall survival (OS) was not significantly different. Subgroup analyses of RFS 
and OS revealed an almost consistent trend in favor of LLH over OLH. In patients 
with tumor sizes of ≥4.0 cm or those with single tumors, both RFS and OS were 
significantly better in the LLH group than in the OLH group.
CONCLUSIONS: LLH decreases the risk of tumor recurrence and improves OS in 
patients with primary HCC located in the left liver.

Previously, we confirmed that Mychonastes sp. 246 methanolic extract (ME) 
markedly reduced the viability of BxPC-3 human pancreatic cancer cells. However, 
the underlying mechanism ME remained unclear. Hence, we attempted to elucidate 
the anticancer effect of ME on BxPC-3 human pancreatic cancer cells. First, we 
investigated the components of ME and their cytotoxicity in normal cells. Then, 
we confirmed the G1 phase arrest mediated growth inhibitory effect of ME using a 
cell counting assay and cell cycle analysis. Moreover, we found that the 
migration-inhibitory effect of ME using a Transwell migration assay. Through RNA 
sequencing, Gene Ontology-based network analysis, and western blotting, we 
explored the intracellular mechanisms of ME in BxPC-3 cells. ME modulated the 
intracellular energy metabolism-related pathway by altering the mRNA levels of 
IGFBP3 and PPARGC1A in BxPC-3 cells and reduced PI3K and mTOR phosphorylation by 
upregulating IGFBP3 and 4E-BP1 expression. Finally, we verified that ME reduced 
the growth of three-dimensional (3D) pancreatic cancer spheroids. Our study 
demonstrates that ME suppresses pancreatic cancer proliferation through the 
IGFBP3-PI3K-mTOR signaling pathway. This is the first study on the anticancer 
effect of the ME against pancreatic cancer, suggesting therapeutic possibilities 
and the underlying mechanism of ME action.

Synergistic Phenomena between Iron-Doped ZnO Nanoparticles and Shock Waves 
Exploited against Pancreatic Cancer Cells.

We propose the use of iron-doped zinc oxide nanoparticles (Fe:ZnO NPs) showing 
theranostic capabilities and being synergistically active against pancreatic 
ductal adenocarcinoma once combined with mechanical pressure waves, such as 
shock waves. Fe:ZnO NPs are synthesized by employing oleic acid as a capping 
agent and are functionalized with amino-propyl groups. We first report their 
superior characteristics with respect to undoped ZnO NPs in terms of magnetic 
properties, colloidal stability, cytocompatibility, and internalization into 
BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. These Fe:ZnO NPs are also 
cytocompatible toward normal pancreatic cells. We then perform a synergistic 
cell treatment with both shock waves and Fe:ZnO NPs once internalized into 
cells. We also evaluate the contribution to the synergistic activity of the NPs 
located in the extracellular space. Results show that both NPs and shock waves, 
when administered separately, are safe to cells, while their combination 
provokes an enhanced cell death after 24 h. Various mechanisms are then 
considered, such as dissolution of NPs, production of free radicals, and cell 
membrane disruption or permeation. It is understood so far that iron-doped ZnO 
NPs can degrade intracellularly into zinc cations, while the use of shock waves 
produce cell membrane permeabilization and possible rupture. In contrast, the 
production of reactive oxygen species is here ruled out. The provoked cell death 
can be recognized in both apoptotic and necrotic events. The proposed work is 
thus a first proof-of-concept study enabling promising future applications to 
deep-seated tumors such as pancreatic cancer, which is still an unmet clinical 
need with a tremendous death rate.

Arjunolic acid (AA) is a pentacyclic triterpenoid with promising anticancer 
properties. A series of novel AA derivatives containing a pentameric A-ring with 
an enal moiety, combined with additional modifications at C-28, were designed 
and prepared. The biological activity on the viability of human cancer and 
non-tumor cell lines was evaluated in order to identify the most promising 
derivatives. Additionally, a preliminary study of the structure-activity 
relationship was carried out. The most active derivative, derivative 26, also 
showed the best selectivity between malignant cells and non-malignant 
fibroblasts. For compound 26, the anticancer molecular mechanism of action in 
PANC-1 cells was further studied and the results showed that this derivative 
induced a cell-cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and significantly inhibited the wound 
closure rate of PANC-1 cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner. 
Additionally, compound 26 synergistically increased the cytotoxicity of 
Gemcitabine, especially at a concentration of 0.24 μM. Moreover, a preliminary 
pharmacological study indicated that at lower doses this compound did not 
demonstrate toxicity in vivo. Taken together, these findings suggest that 
compound 26 may be a valuable compound for the development of new pancreatic 
anticancer treatment, and further studies are needed to explore its full 
potential.

Publisher: Közleményünk célja bemutatni az új sebészi technikát és módszereket, 
amelyeket 1986 óta alkalmazunk az inficiálódott necrotizáló pancreatitis, 
a krónikus pancratitis gyógyításakor, illetve a szigetsejt-transzplantáció 
alkalmával. Az inficiálódott necrotizáló pancreatitis (INP) az akut pancreatitis 
legsúlyosabb formája, amely az esetek többségében felelős a pancreatitishez 
kapcsolódó morbiditásért és magas halálozásért. 1986 óta 224 beteget 
gyógyítottunk INP miatt. A sebészi terápia magában foglalta a kiterjesztett 
necrosectomiát, a többszörös drenázst, amely biztosította a folyamatos öblítést. 
A sebészi beavatkozást követően supportiv kezelést alkalmaztunk. A globális 
kórházi mortalitás 7,7% volt. Tapasztalataink szerint, az INP komplex terápiája, 
amely magában foglalja az adequat sebészi beavatkozást, a folyamatos, hosszan 
tartó, többszörös öblítést és a supportiv kezelést, biztosíthatja a sikeres 
gyógyítást. A krónikus pancreatitisben szenvedő betegek egyharmadában az 
inflammatoricus folyamat a pancreasfej gyulladásos tumorát idézi elő, amely 
a vezetékrendszerek obstructioját, alkalmasint a duodenum kompresszióját idézi 
elő, fájdalmat és fogyást okozva. Minthogy egy benignus elváltozással állunk 
szemben, egy biztonságos szervmegtartó pancreasfej-resectiót (OPPHR) dolgoztunk 
ki, amely magában foglalja a pancreasfejben kialakult gyulladásos tumor széles 
resectióját, anélkül, hogy a pancreast a v. portae felett izolálnánk, illetve 
átvágnánk. Napjainkig 196 esetben végeztünk szervmegtartó pancreasfej-resectiót 
mortalitás nélkül. A műtét után a betegek életminősége 89%-ban javult. A 10 éves 
klinikai megfigyelés és a prospektiv randomizált összehasonlító vizsgálat 
egyértelműen alátámasztotta, hogy az OPPHR-műtét egy biztonságos és hatásos 
beavatkozás, amely hosszú távon javítja a betegek életminőségét. A distalis 
pancreas resectio leggyakoribb szövődménye a pancreas fistula, amelynek 
kivédésére számos műtéti megoldást alkalmaznak, változó sikerrel. Az irodalmi 
adatok alapján a fistula kialakulása 6–30% -ra tehető distalis resectio után. 
Műtéti gyakorlatunkban 1994-ben alkalmaztuk először a pancreas resectios 
felszínének zárására a Premium PolysorbR (abszorbeálodó laktomer) kapocssort. 
Napjainkig e módszert 187 distalis resectiós műtétnél alkalmaztuk. 
A postoperativ időszakban két esetben jelentkezett pancreas fistula, amelyek 
konzervatív kezelésre szanálódtak. Így a postoperativ fistula incidenciája 0,9% 
volt. A hasnyálmirigy-szigetsejt beültetésének egyik potenciális és egyben 
ígéretes forrása az embrionális hasnyálmirigy. Az embrionális pancreas endokrin 
szövet tartama csaknem 90%. Az izolált szigetek megfelelő feltételek mellett 
hosszabb ideig mesterséges körülmények között tenyészthetők, és ez alatt 
jelentős mértékű sejtosztódás, illetve differenciálódás jön létre. Előnynek 
tekinthető, hogy a tenyésztett szövetkultúra mélyfagyasztásos tárolása is 
megoldott, mely ún. szövetbank kialakítását teszi lehetővé. Az első embrionális 
szigetsejt klinikai transzplantációnk 1982-ben történt. Az ezt követő 25 
esetben, köztük egy kombinált vese- és szigetsejt-beültetés, bár 
inzulinmentességet nem sikerül elérni, de az inzulinszükséglet szignifikáns 
csökkenése mellett, a cukoranyagcsere normalizálódott, és az 5–10 évig működő 
szigetsejtapparátus hatására a még nem visszafordíthatatlan másodlagos 
diabeteszes szövődmények (retinopathia, nephropathia, neuropathia) progressziója 
megállt, sőt az esetek egy részében javulást is eredményezett.

BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer 
globally, with limited therapies and unsatisfactory prognosis once in the 
advanced stages. With promising advances in locoregional and systematic 
treatments, fast development of targeted drugs, the success of immunotherapy, as 
well as the emergence of the therapeutic alliance, conversion therapy has 
recently become more well developed and an effective therapeutic strategy. This 
article aimed to review recent developments in conversion therapy in liver 
transplantation (LT) for HCC.
DATA SOURCES: We searched for relevant publications on PubMed before September 
2022, using the terms "HCC", "liver transplantation", "downstaging", "bridging 
treatment" and "conversion therapy."
RESULTS: Conversion therapy was frequently represented as a combination of 
multiple treatment modalities to downstage HCC and make patients eligible for 
LT. Although combining various local and systematic treatments in conversion 
therapy is still controversial, growing evidence has suggested that multimodal 
combined treatment strategies downstage HCC in a shorter time, which ultimately 
increases the opportunities for LT. Moreover, the recent breakthrough of 
immunotherapy and targeted therapy for HCC also benefit patients with 
advanced-stage tumors.
CONCLUSIONS: In the era of targeted therapy and immunotherapy, applying the 
thinking of transplant oncology to benefit HCC patients receiving LT is a new 
topic that has shed light on advanced-stage patients. With the expansion of 
conversion therapy concepts, further investigation and research is required to 
realize the full potential of conversion treatment strategies, including 
accurately selecting candidates, determining the timing of surgery, improving 
the conversion rate, and guaranteeing the safety and long-term efficacy of 
treatment.

Intestinal bacteria coexist with humans and play a role in suppressing the 
invasion of pathogens, producing short-chain fatty acids, producing vitamins, 
and controlling the immune system. Studies have been carried out on culturable 
bacterial species using bacterial culture methods for many years. However, as 
metagenomic analysis of bacterial genes has been developed since the 1990s, it 
has recently revealed that many bacteria in the intestine cannot be cultured and 
that approximately 1,000 species and 40 trillion bacteria are present in the gut 
microbiota. Furthermore, the composition of the microbiota is different in each 
disease state compared with the healthy state, and dysbiosis has received much 
attention as a cause of various diseases. Regarding gastrointestinal diseases, 
dysbiosis has been reported to be involved in inflammatory bowel disease, 
irritable bowel syndrome, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Recent findings 
have also suggested that dysbiosis is involved in colon cancer, liver cancer, 
pancreatic cancer, esophageal cancer, and so on. This review focuses on the 
relationship between the gut microbiota and gastrointestinal/hepatobiliary 
diseases and also discusses new therapies targeting the gut microbiota.

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most fatal malignant tumors, and is 
commonly diagnosed at an advanced stage with no effective therapy. 
Metabolism-related genes (MRGs) and immune-related genes (IRGs) play 
considerable roles in the tumor microenvironment. Therefore, an effective 
prediction model based on MRGs and IRGs could aid in the prognosis of PC. In 
this study, differential expression analysis was performed to gain 25 
intersectional genes from 857 differentially expressed MRGs (DEMRGs), and 1353 
differentially expressed IRGs, from The Cancer Genome Atlas database of PC. Cox 
and Lasso regression were applied and a five-DEMRGs prognostic model 
constructed. Survival analysis, ROC values, risk curve and validation analysis 
showed that the model could independently predict PC prognosis. In addition, the 
correlation analysis suggested that the five-DEMRGs prognostic model could 
reflect the status of the immune microenvironment, including Tregs, M1 
macrophages and Mast cell resting. Therefore, our study provides new underlying 
predictive biomarkers and associated immunotherapy targets.

BACKGROUND: Little is known about the outcomes of patients with advanced 
pancreatic cancer admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to medical 
complications. We designed a study to evaluate their short-term (30-day) 
survival, predictors of short-term survival and chances of additional 
chemotherapy.
METHODS: We reviewed all patients with advanced (stage III or IV) pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma admitted to an ICU in a dedicated Brazilian cancer centre from 
2009 to 2018 due to medical reasons. We fitted multivariate regression models to 
identify predictors of 30-day survival and additional systemic chemotherapy.
RESULTS: The study population consisted of 171 patients. Ninety-four patients 
(55.0%) had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 2-4 and 
146 (85.4%) had metastatic disease. Most patients (N = 75; 43.9%) were admitted 
to the ICU during first-line treatment. Median overall survival was 32 days (95% 
confidence interval (95% CI): 20-49). Survival rate at 30 days was 50.6%. ECOG 
performance status 2-4 was the only variable associated with lower probability 
of survival at 30 days in multivariate analysis (odds ratio: 0.28; 95% CI: 
0.14-0.54; p < 0.001). Overall, 58 patients (33.9%) received additional 
chemotherapy and among all patients, 13.5% experienced clinical benefit from 
this treatment.
CONCLUSION: Patients with advanced pancreatic cancer admitted to the ICU for 
medical reasons have a dismal prognosis. Early palliative care and refined tools 
to establish those who would benefit from an ICU trial could help improve 
patients' care.

Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN) is an extremely rare tumor with low 
malignant potential which is generally located in the tail of the pancreas. The 
prevalence of SPN has increased with the recent advancement in radiological 
imaging. CECT abdomen and Endoscopic ultrasound-FNA are excellent modalities in 
preoperative diagnosis. Surgery is the main treatment modality of choice and a 
successful R0 resection is curative. We present a case of solid pseudopapillary 
neoplasm and included a summary of the current literature to provide a reference 
for the management of this rare clinical entity.

BACKGROUND: Elevated tissue factor (TF) expression, although restricted in 
normal tissue, has been reported in multiple solid cancers, and expression has 
been associated with poor prognosis. This manuscript compares TF expression 
across various solid tumor types via immunohistochemistry in a single study, 
which has not been performed previously.
AIMS: To increase insight in the prevalence and cellular localization of TF 
expression across solid cancer types, we performed a detailed and systematic 
analysis of TF expression in tumor tissue obtained from patients with ovarian, 
esophageal, bladder, cervical, endometrial, pancreatic, prostate, colon, breast, 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma 
(HNSCC), and glioblastoma. The spatial and temporal variation of TF expression 
was analyzed over time and upon disease progression in patient-matched biopsies 
taken at different timepoints. In addition, TF expression in patient-matched 
primary tumor and metastatic lesions was also analyzed.
METHODS AND RESULTS: TF expression was detected via immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
using a validated TF-specific antibody. TF was expressed in all cancer types 
tested, with highest prevalence in pancreatic cancer, cervical cancer, colon 
cancer, glioblastoma, HNSCC, and NSCLC, and lowest in breast cancer. Staining 
was predominantly membranous in pancreatic, cervical, and HNSCC, and cytoplasmic 
in glioblastoma and bladder cancer. In general, expression was consistent 
between biopsies obtained from the same patient over time, although variability 
was observed for individual patients. NSCLC biopsies of primary tumor and 
matched lymph node metastases showed no clear difference in TF expression 
overall, although individual patient changes were observed.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that TF is expressed across a broad range of solid 
cancer types, and expression is present upon tumor dissemination and over the 
course of treatment.

Pancreatic cancer, despite significant progress in diagnosis and treatment still 
has poor prognosis. Surgical treatment remains the only cure option. 
Unfortunately, the percentage of patients in whom radical tumor removal is 
possible is less than 20%. Resection procedures are burdened with a high degree 
of difficulty, as well as a high complication rate. One of the important factors 
contributing to the high morbidity of the perioperative period is malnutrition, 
and rapidly progressing malnutrition which occurs in about 85% of pancreatic 
cancer patients. Abnormal nutritional status is closely related to a change in 
the composition in the body.The aim of the study was to determine the changes in 
the body composition of patients with pancreatic cancer and their consequences 
based on the results of the current research.The available reports have shown 
that the body composition of a patient with pancreatic cancer undoubtedly 
changes and is dependent on the stage, location and type of cancer. Furthermore, 
the fact if antitumor treatment is applied or not, also plays a significant 
role.It appears that in patients with pancreatic cancer, weight loss with a 
decline in parameters such as body fat and skeletal muscle mass appears early 
and worsens as the tumor grows and the disease progresses. The above data 
suggest that knowing the patient&apos;s body composition and observing its 
changes may be a prognostic factor for survival and the occurrence of 
complications. Additionally, there are reports that dosing chemotherapy based on 
body composition rather than conventional measures can help reduce the toxicity 
of the treatment. Therefore, knowing the patient&apos;s body composition seems 
to be an important aspect.

In order to explore the relationship between GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene polymorphisms 
and gallbladder cancer, so as to find a better treatment and prevention of 
gallbladder cancer and improve the treatment effect. In this paper, 247 patients 
with gallbladder cancer were selected for the experiment, including 187 male 
patients and 60 female patients. The total number of patients was randomly 
divided into two groups, namely the case group and the control group. The 
patients in normal condition and after treatment of tumor tissue and adjacent 
non-tumor tissue gene detection, and then through the logistic regression model 
to analyze the data. After the experiment, we found that the frequency ratio of 
GSTM1 and GSTT1 in gallbladder cancer patients before treatment was 57.33% and 
52.37%, which was very high, which was very disadvantageous in gene detection. 
However, after treatment, the frequency of deletion of the two genes was 45.73% 
and 51.02%, which was significantly reduced. The reduced gene ratio is very 
beneficial to the observation of gallbladder cancer. Therefore, the surgical 
treatment of gallbladder cancer before the first drug after gene testing, in the 
understanding of various principles, will have twice the result with half the 
effort.

Introduction: Bispecific antibody (BiAb)-armed activated T cells (BATs) comprise 
an adoptive T cell therapy platform for treating cancer. Arming activated T 
cells (ATC) with anti-CD3 x anti-tumour associated antigen (TAA) BiAbs converts 
ATC into non-major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted anti-tumour 
cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Binding of target antigens via the BiAb bridge 
enables specific anti-tumour cytotoxicity, Th1 cytokines release, and T cell 
proliferation. Clinical trials in breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancer using 
BATs armed with chemically heteroconjugated BiAbs demonstrated safety, 
feasibility, induction of anti-tumour immune responses and potential increases 
in overall survival (OS).Objectives: The primary objective of this study was to 
develop a recombinant BiAb that confers enhanced anti-tumour activity of BATs 
against a broad range of solid tumours.Methods: A recombinant anti-epidermal 
growth factor receptor (EGFR) x anti-CD3 (OKT3) BiAb (rEGFRBi) was designed and 
expressed in CHO cells, used to arm ATC (rEGFR-BATs), and tested for specific 
cytotoxicity against breast, pancreatic and prostate cancers and 
glioblastoma.Results: rEGFR-BATs exhibit remarkably enhanced specific 
cytotoxicity and T1 cytokine secretion against a wide range of solid tumour cell 
lines vs. their respective chemically-heteroconjugated BATs.Conclusion: 
rEGFR-BATs may provide a "universal" T cell therapy for treating a wide range of 
solid tumours. KEY MESSAGEA (Gly4Ser)6 linker between the variable light and 
heavy chains of an scFv fused to the N-terminus of a heavy chain antibody 
confers unexpected stability to the heavy chain fusion protein and supports the 
efficient expression of the bispecific antibody.Arming of activated T cells with 
the rEGFRBi greatly enhances the relative cytotoxicity and Th1 cytokine 
secretion of theT cells relative to a chemically heteroconjugated 
BiAbs.rEGFR-BATs are promising candidates for the treatment of a broad range of 
solid tumours.

PURPOSE: Re-irradiation of locally recurrent pancreatic cancer may be an optimal 
choice as a local ablative therapy. However, dose constraints of organs at risk 
(OARs) predictive of severe toxicity remain unknown. Therefore, we aim to 
calculate and identify accumulated dose distributions of OARs correlating with 
severe adverse effects and determine possible dose constraints regarding 
re-irradiation.
METHODS: Patients receiving two courses of stereotactic body radiation therapy 
(SBRT) for the same irradiated regions (the primary tumors) due to local 
recurrence were included. All doses of the first and second plans were 
recalculated to an equivalent dose of 2 Gy per fraction (EQD2). Deformable image 
registration with the workflow "Dose Accumulation-Deformable" of the MIM® System 
(version: 6.6.8) was performed for dose summations. Dose-volume parameters 
predictive of grade 2 or more toxicities were identified, and the receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine optimal thresholds of 
dose constraints.
RESULTS: Forty patients were included in the analysis. Only the V 10 of the 
stomach [hazard ratio (HR): 1.02 (95% CI:1.00-1.04), P = 0.035] and D mean of 
the intestine [HR: 1.78 (95% CI: 1.00-3.18), P = 0.049] correlated with grade 2 
or more gastrointestinal toxicity. Hence, the equation of probability of such 
toxicity was P = 1/1 Additionally, the area under the ROC curve and threshold of 
dose constraints of V 10 of the stomach and D mean of the intestine were 0.779 
and 77.575 cc, 0.769 and 4.22 Gy3 (α/β = 3), respectively. The area under the 
ROC curve of the equation was 0.821.
CONCLUSION: The V 10 of the stomach and D mean of the intestine may be vital 
parameters to predict grade 2 or more gastrointestinal toxicity, of which the 
threshold of dose constraints may be beneficial for the practice of 
re-irradiation of locally relapsed pancreatic cancer.

The outcome of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) patients is poor, given 
resistance to gemcitabine. Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) has been implicated in 
the carcinogenesis of pancreatic cancer; however, its function and mechanism in 
PAAD resistance to gemcitabine (GEM) are yet unknown. Herein, we demonstrate 
that lncRNA DSCR9 is significantly reduced in PAAD in vitro and in vivo. CCK-8, 
BrdU and flow cytometry assays show that overexpression of DSCR9 markedly 
suppresses pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and invasion, and promotes 
apoptosis under gemcitabine treatment. BTG2 acts as a tumor suppressor by 
reducing the proliferation and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells and 
increasing gemcitabine-induced apoptosis. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining 
combined with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of pancreatic cancer 
tissues shows that DSCR9 and BTG2 are both increased in pancreatic cancer 
tissues. Luciferase assay shows that miR-21-5p simultaneously binds to DSCR9 and 
3'UTR of BTG2; DSCR9 relieves miR-21-5p-induced inhibition of BTG2 by competing 
with BTG2 for miR-21-5p binding. Overexpression of miR-21-5p enhances the 
invasiveness of pancreatic cancer cells by promoting cancer cell proliferation 
and invasion and attenuating gemcitabine-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of 
miR-21-5p attenuates the effect of DSCR9 overexpression on BTG2 expression and 
invasiveness of pancreatic cancer cells. Finally, miR-21-5p expression is 
increased, while BTG2 expression is decreased in pancreatic cancer tissues. 
miR-21-5p is negatively correlated with DSCR9 and BTG2. In conclusion, the 
DSCR9/miR-21-5p/BTG2 axis modulates pancreatic cancer proliferation, invasion, 
and gemcitabine resistance.

Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury occurs frequently in various liver 
operations and diseases, but its effective treatment remains inadequate because 
the key switch that leads to hepatic explosive inflammation has not been well 
disclosed. Dual specificity phosphatase 9 (DUSP9) is widely involved in the 
innate immune response of solid organs and is sometimes regulated by ubiquitin. 
In the present study, we find that DUSP9 is reduced in mouse hepatic I/R injury. 
DUSP9 enrichment attenuates hepatic inflammation both in vivo and in vitro as 
revealed by western blot analysis and qRT-PCR. In contrast, DUSP9 depletion 
leads to more severe I/R injury. Mechanistically, DUSP9 inhibits the 
phosphorylation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) by directly 
binding to ASK1, thereby decreasing tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated 
factor 6 (TRAF6), K63 ubiquitin and the phosphorylation of p38/JNK1 instead of 
ERK1. The present study documents a novel role of DUSP9 in hepatic I/R injury 
and implies the potential of targeting the DUSP9/ASK1 axis towards 
mitogen-activated protein kinase and TRAF6/inhibitor of κB kinase pathways.

INTRODUCTION: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is one of the most aggressive 
malignancies in humans. The main reason for its unfavourable prognosis is the 
combination of rapid tumour growth, early-onset metastasis and currently still 
inadequate diagnostic and therapeutic options. Thus, only very few patients are 
eligible for radical resection of the primary tumour as the only curative 
treatment option available so far. In the perioperative period, tumour 
progression and metastasis are facilitated by the activation of key signalling 
pathways and the altered regulation of transcription factors. Various tumour 
entities have shown increased expression of the integrin-3 receptor subunit, 
which correlates with more rapid tumour progression and metastasis through 
advanced migration, invasion and proliferation. The influence of perioperative 
medication and postoperative pain management remains unclear. To investigate the 
effects of ketamine, s-ketamine and MK 801 on integrin beta-3-mediated cell 
migration in pancreatic cancer cells in vitro.
METHODS: The effects of ketamine, s-ketamine and MK 801 on integrin beta-3 
expression were investigated with immunoblot. Cell migratory potentials were 
analysed using a Cell Migration Assay Kit with a Boyden chamber, in which cells 
migrate through a semipermeable membrane under different stimuli.
RESULTS: Stimulation with ketamine and MK 801 significantly promoted migration 
in pancreatic cancer cells, increasing the expression of integrin beta-3.
CONCLUSION: Novel therapeutic approaches target the effective modulation of 
specific signalling and transcription pathways. The prerequisite for such 
'target therapies' is comprehensive knowledge about the respective 
carcinogenesis. Further studies are required to identify the underlying disease 
mechanisms of pancreatic carcinoma.

Despite technological advances in radiation therapy for cancer treatment, many 
patient populations still experience mediocre survival percentages, local 
control, and quality of life. Additionally, much of the world lacks access to 
expensive, modern treatment options. The need for innovative, cost-effective 
solutions that can improve patient treatment outcomes is essential. 
Phytomedicines have been shown to induce apoptotic tumor cell death, diminish 
tumor progression, reduce cancer incidence, alleviate harmful hypoxic 
conditions, and more. While an ample amount of research is available that 
characterizes many phytomedicines as having anti-cancer properties that increase 
tumor cell killing/control and mitigate the harmful side effects of radiation 
damage, little work has been done to investigate the synergistic effect of 
phytoradiotherapy: combining radiation treatment with phytomedicines. In this 
study, a protocol for testing the radiosensitizing effects of phytomedicines was 
validated and used to investigate the well-known plant based medicine 
cannabidiol (CBD) and the lesser-known medicinal fruit Bitter Melon. 
Additionally, based on its high concentration of plant hemoglobin which has been 
shown to abate hypoxia, the African-indigenous Justicia plant was tested in 
pancreatic adenocarcinoma mouse models. The studies reveal that these 
phytomedicines can effectively enhance tumor cell killing, minimize tumor 
growth, and prolong mice survival. There is certainly the need for additional 
research in this regard, however, phytoradiotherapy: the use of phytomedicines 
to enhance radiation therapy treatment outcomes, continues to show potential as 
a promising, innovative way to improve cancer care.

University, Shanghai, China.

Pancreatic duct stenting using endoscopy or surgery is widely used for the 
management of benign and malignant pancreatic diseases. Endoscopic pancreatic 
stents are mainly used to relieve pain caused by chronic pancreatitis and 
pancreas divisum, and to treat pancreatic duct disruption and stenotic 
pancreaticointestinal anastomosis after surgery. They are also used to prevent 
postendoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis and 
postoperative pancreatic fistula, treat pancreatic cancer, and locate 
radiolucent stones. Recent advances in endoscopic techniques, such as endoscopic 
ultrasonography and balloon enteroscopy, and newly designed stents have 
broadened the indications for pancreatic duct stenting. In this review we 
outlined the types, insertion procedures, efficacy, and complications of 
endoscopic pancreatic duct stent placement, and summarized the applications of 
pancreatic duct stents in surgery.

INTRODUCTION: Medullary pancreatic carcinoma (MPC) is a rare subtype of 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. MPCs represent less than 1% of all pancreatic 
cancers, and, with only 26 cases in the literature, knowledge regarding drug 
response and treatment outcome is very limited.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present the case of a 64-year-old male patient with MPC 
who was treated by left pancreatic resection and adjuvant chemotherapy. Due to 
local recurrence, the patient underwent intended curative reoperation. From both 
surgical specimens, patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and, from the recurrence, 
a patient-derived cell line (PDCL) were established. We subsequently performed 
an in-depth characterization of this cell line including phenotypic 
characterization, surface protein expression, growth, and migratory performance 
as well as mutational analysis using whole-exome sequencing (WES). Additionally, 
in vitro drug sensitivity toward the standard-of-care chemotherapeutic regimen 
and selected targeted therapies was evaluated.
RESULTS: The pathological and molecular properties of this rare MPC case 
observed in the patient's tumors are preserved in the corresponding PDX and the 
PDCL of HROP68Tu2. Despite displaying an "immunogenic phenotype" with marked 
T-cell infiltration and a high-level expression of HLA II and Programmed 
death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), molecular analysis revealed microsatellite stability but 
a multitude of mutations affecting KRAS, TP53, KAT6B, FOXG1, RUNX1, and GRIK2 
among others. Furthermore, HROP68Tu2 cells were susceptible toward 5-FU, 
irinotecan, oxaliplatin, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, and erlotinib as single 
agents, but only a moderate synergistic response was seen to the drugs of the 
FOLFIRINOX regimen. Even worse, the drugs of the two combinations gemcitabine 
plus paclitaxel and gemcitabine plus erlotinib showed antagonistic effects. 
Moreover, lapatinib, PRIMA-Met1, and olaparib selected as targeted therapeutics 
according to the mutational profiles and protein expression inhibited HROP68Tu2 
cells' growth.
CONCLUSION: This study illustrates the establishment of the first preclinical 
MPC models as well as the first in-depth characterization of an MPC PDCL. Since 
the scientific and clinical knowledge of this rare pancreatic cancer type is 
very limited, the presented models contribute to a better understanding of MPC 
and might be a valuable tool for the development of future treatment options.

BACKGROUND: WASF2 regulates actin reorganization during cell migration. WASF2 
has been identified as a regulator of the development of gastric cancer, breast 
cancer, and pancreatic cancer. But its regulatory mechanisms remain unknown. 
Also, its function was absent in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). 
Consequently, we examined the effect of DNA methylation on aberrant WASF2 
expression in HNSCC.
METHODS: TNMplot, TIMER, GSEA pathway analysis, and the Kaplan-Meier Plotter 
database were used to analyze the expression, function, and prognostic value of 
WASF2, as well as the correlation between WASF2 and infiltrating immune cells in 
HNSCC or pan-cancer analysis. WASF2 promoter methylation levels and the 
correlation between WASF2 expression and WASF2 promoter methylation in HNSCC 
were evaluated using the DNMIVD database. The effect of DNA methylation 
inhibitor on WASF2 expression was demonstrated in the GEO database. Finally, the 
TISIDB database determined the relationships between WASF2 methylation, immune 
cell infiltration, and immune inhibitors.
RESULTS: WASF2 was significantly downregulated in HNSCC tissues where WASF2 
promoter methylation was elevated. According to the GEO database, treatment with 
a DNA methylation inhibitor notably restored the mRNA expression of WASF2. WASF2 
expression was also a favorable indicator of human papilloma virus 
(HPV)-positive HNSCC. Its level of promoter methylation had detrimental effects 
on patient survival. In addition, patients with elevated levels of WASF2 
demonstrated active G2/M regulation, TGF-β signaling, Kras signaling, fatty acid 
metabolism, and p53 pathways. WASF2 was positively associated with tumor-killing 
immune cells, while WASF2 methylation was positively related to 
immunosuppressive cells and immune-inhibitors.
CONCLUSIONS: Hypermethylated WASF2 acted as a tumor suppressor of HNSCC by 
regulating tumor formation and immune imbalance.

(panNET) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) may represent a rare coincidence or a 
manifestation of von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL). These two malignancies share 
both radiological and cytopathological features, making the differential 
diagnosis very challenging. In this review, we collected all cases of concurrent 
diagnosis of localized panNET and RCC, with or without VHL, as reported in the 
literature to date. We aimed to provide an insight into the differential 
diagnosis between panNET and RCC pancreatic metastasis with a focus on the 
optimal therapeutic algorithm depending on the diagnosis. We performed 
literature research in PubMed library databases for articles about coexisting 
panNET and RCC published from 2001 to 2018. We selected nine articles with a 
total of 13 patients, including one treated at our institution. Patients' median 
age was 49 years and eight out of 13 patients were women. VHL was diagnosed in 
nine cases. Most patients underwent radical nephrectomy for RCC (9/13) and a 
clear cell renal carcinoma variant was identified in six cases. The diagnosis of 
panNET was synchronous with RCC detection in nine cases and metachronous in four 
cases. The diameter of the pancreatic lesion was >2 cm in six cases. In two 
cases the panNET was misdiagnosed as metastatic RCC by radiological tests. 
Somatostatin receptor scanning was performed only in our patient (Octreoscan) 
showing intense uptake in the pancreatic mass. Endoscopic ultrasound fine needle 
aspiration of the pancreatic lesion was performed in four patients: in two cases 
the panNET was confused with metastatic RCC by cytological analysis. Most 
patients underwent pancreatic surgery (10/13) without histological confirmation. 
Clear cell panNET was recognized in six cases, while mixed neuroendocrine 
non-neuroendocrine neoplasm was diagnosed in one patient. Immunohistochemistry 
(IHC) staining showed positivity to typical neuroendocrine markers (chromogranin 
A and synaptophysin) in all reported tested cases (8/8). Three patients 
underwent systemic treatment: two patients received sunitinib and one patient 
interleukin-2 (IL-2). Other neoplasms were observed in seven patients, of whom 
six were affected by VHL syndrome. When neoplastic lesions are recognized in 
both the kidney and pancreas, panNET and RCC pancreatic metastasis are often 
misdiagnosed due to similar radiological and cytopathological features. An 
accurate differential diagnosis is crucial and IHC plays a central role in 
distinguishing the two entities. The therapeutic algorithm may change depending 
on the diagnosis: while pancreatic RCC metastases benefit from resection, in 
panNETs and VHL the indication for surgery must be carefully evaluated.

Introduction: Pancreatic cancer is a severe oncological disease with an 
ever-increasing incidence and a high rate of morbidity and mortality. 
Therapeutic options are limited and the five-year overall survival rate is 
7–20%, depending on the possibility of surgical resection and the earliness of 
detection. Most patients with this diagnosis die due to the resistance of tumour 
cells and their microenvironment to the used treatment regimes. Methods: In our 
study, we focused on the implementation of two in vivo models, which are the 
cell-line derived xenograft (CDX) and the patient-derived xenograft (PDX). These 
two models differ significantly from each other methodologically, technically, 
financially, but also in their achieved results. Results: In a pilot study, we 
managed to successfully implement the CDX model with a very aggressive and 
resistant PaCa-44 line of pancreatic cancer in a total of 30 NU/NU strain mice. 
Furthermore, we created three PDX models with various subtypes of pancreatic 
cancer from patients operated at the University Hospital Kralovske Vinohrady, 
Department of General Surgery. These tumours were re-transplanted into 
subsequent generations of 23 individuals of NOD/SCID strain and 47 NU/NU strain 
mice. The established CDX and PDX models are then used to compare conventional 
and experimental chemotherapy regimens. Conclusion: The next steps will be to 
evaluate the effects of treatment regimens by using imaging and molecular 
genetic methods and to optimise the entire process for further use in precise 
personalised medicine for patients with pancreatic cancer. The upcoming goal is 
to create a library of PDX models of the most common pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma and other rare subtypes of pancreatic cancer.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Magnetic resonance guided radiotherapy (MRgRT) is an 
emerging technological innovation with more and more institutions gaining 
clinical experience in this new field of radiation oncology. The ability to 
better visualize both tumors and healthy tissues due to excellent soft tissue 
contrast combined with new possibilities regarding motion management and the 
capability of online adaptive radiotherapy might increase tumor control rates 
while potentially reducing the risk of radiation-induced toxicities. As 
conventional computed tomography (CT)-based image guidance methods are 
insufficient for adaptive workflows in abdominal tumors, MRgRT appears to be an 
optimal method for this tumor site. The aim of this narrative review is to 
outline the opportunities and challenges in magnetic resonance guided radiation 
therapy in gastrointestinal cancers.
METHODS: We searched for studies, reviews and conceptual articles, including the 
general technique of MRgRT and the specific utilization in gastrointestinal 
cancers, focusing on pancreatic cancer, liver metastases and primary liver 
cancer, rectal cancer and esophageal cancer.
KEY CONTENT AND FINDINGS: This review is highlighting the innovative approach of 
MRgRT in gastrointestinal cancer and gives an overview of the currently 
available literature with regard to clinical experiences and theoretical 
background.
CONCLUSIONS: MRgRT is a promising new tool in radiation oncology, which can play 
off several of its beneficial features in the specific field of gastrointestinal 
cancers. However, clinical data is still scarce. Nevertheless, the available 
literature points out large potential for improvements regarding dose coverage 
and escalation as well as the reduction of dose exposure to critical organs at 
risk (OAR). Further prospective studies are needed to demonstrate the role of 
this innovative technology in gastrointestinal cancer management, in particular 
trials that randomly compare MRgRT with conventional CT-based image-guided 
radiotherapy (IGRT) would be of high value.

Pancreatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (PGISTs) are exceptionally rare, 
accounting for <5% of extra-gastrointestinal stromal tumors (EGISTs) and <1% of 
malignant pancreatic neoplasms. We present a unique case of concurrent double 
primary malignancies in a 46-year-old female with a history of recurrent 
myoepithelial carcinoma of the parotid gland, managed through surgical resection 
and adjuvant therapy. She presented with an enlarging abdominal mass, initially 
suggestive of pancreatic metastasis. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed 
positive staining for smooth-muscle actin (SMA) and CD34 in both parotid and 
pancreatic tissues. Importantly, CD117 expression was confined to the pancreatic 
tissue, confirming the diagnosis of PGIST rather than metastasis. Subsequently, 
a splenic-sparing distal pancreatectomy was performed, followed by immediate 
imatinib therapy. This case underscores the potential for the coexistence of 
rare primary malignancies with unique histopathological characteristics and 
organ involvement. When encountering a newly developed lesion in a distant 
organ, surgeons must consider the possibility of metastasis to guide therapeutic 
decision-making. Early diagnosis and appropriate intervention are paramount, 
particularly in the case of PGIST, given its infrequent presentation and 
clinical complexities.

Pancreatic cancer, a highly fatal malignancy, is predicted to rank as the second 
leading cause of cancer-related death in the next decade. This highlights the 
urgent need for new insights into personalized diagnosis and treatment. Although 
molecular subtypes of pancreatic cancer were well established in genomics and 
transcriptomics, few known molecular classifications are translated to guide 
clinical strategies and require a paradigm shift. Notably, chronically 
developing and continuously improving high-throughput technologies and systems 
serve as an important driving force to further portray the molecular landscape 
of pancreatic cancer in terms of epigenomics, proteomics, metabonomics, and 
metagenomics. Therefore, a more comprehensive understanding of molecular 
classifications at multiple levels using an integrated multi-omics approach 
holds great promise to exploit more potential therapeutic options. In this 
review, we recapitulated the molecular spectrum from different omics levels, 
discussed various subtypes on multi-omics means to move one step forward towards 
bench-to-beside translation of pancreatic cancer with clinical impact, and 
proposed some methodological and scientific challenges in store.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy causes numerous 
immune-related adverse events, including autoimmune pancreatic injury (AIPI), 
which results in rapid organ atrophy. We profiled the clinico-radiological 
features, short-term natural history, and response to steroids of AIPI.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 229/11,165 (2.1%) adult 
patients with AIPI. One hundred and ten out of 229 (48%) had abdominal 
computerized tomography (CT) scan at lipase elevation; data of 110 without 
pancreatic metastases were analyzed. We analyzed serial CT-based pancreas 
volumetry data in 48 patients with AIPI (32 with normal CT and 16 with 
pancreatitis on CT at lipase elevation). We examined impact of steroids on pain 
and disease course.
RESULTS: In AIPI (n = 229), median lipase elevation was 4x upper limit of normal 
(range: 3-40x). The injury was more often asymptomatic than painful (143/229 
(62%) vs 86/229 (38%), P < .000). Majority (83/110 (75%) had normal CT, often in 
painless vs painful disease: 51/57 (90%) vs 32/53 (60%), P < .001) 25% had 
interstitial pancreatitis. On serial pancreas volumetry, marked volume (cc) loss 
occurred 1 year after vs 3 months before lipase elevation in both normal CT 
(median 81.6 vs 61.3, P = .00) and pancreatitis on CT groups (91.8 vs 60.5, P = 
.00), ≥20% volume loss occurred in 47% vs 73%, respectively (P = .08). Steroids, 
when used did not mitigate pain, biochemical relapse, pancreas volume loss or 
1-year diabetes incidence (7.2%).
CONCLUSION: Autoimmune pancreatic injury (AIPI) is uniquely characterized by 
painless lipase elevation, normal pancreas on CT and rapid pancreatic volume 
loss on follow-up. Steroids do not appear to have a role in management.

INTRODUCTION: Lenvatinib (dosing for patients who weigh ≥60 kg was 12 mg/day; 
for patients who weigh <60 kg, the dose was 8 mg/day) plus pembrolizumab 200 mg 
once every 3 weeks demonstrated antitumor activity and a manageable safety 
profile in patients with first-line unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC) 
in the open-label phase 1b Study 116/KEYNOTE-524 (primary analysis data cutoff 
date: October 31, 2019; median follow-up: 10.6 months). This analysis (updated 
data cutoff date: March 31, 2021) reports efficacy results from 17 months of 
additional follow-up time.
METHODS: 100 patients with uHCC were included in the primary analysis (median 
follow-up: 27.6 months). Endpoints included overall survival (OS), 
investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate 
(ORR), and duration of response (DOR) per modified RECIST. Landmark analyses of 
OS by the best response at 3 and 9 months were performed. Pembrolizumab antidrug 
antibodies (ADAs) and concentrations were also measured (cutoff date: August 7, 
2020).
RESULTS: ORR was 43.0% (95% CI 33.1-53.3%) and median DOR was 17.1 months (95% 
CI 6.9-19.3 months). Median PFS and OS were 9.3 months (95% CI 7.4-9.8 months) 
and 20.4 months (95% CI 14.4-25.9 months), respectively. No treatment-emergent 
ADAs were detected.
CONCLUSION: Results show a sustained treatment effect with lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab in patients with uHCC in the first-line setting.

INTRODUCTION: The phase III IMbrave150 study established atezolizumab + 
bevacizumab as the global standard of care in patients with unresectable 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This exploratory analysis examined the impact of 
bevacizumab interruption due to bevacizumab adverse events of special interest 
(AESIs).
METHODS: Patients in IMbrave150 who were randomized to atezolizumab + 
bevacizumab and received treatment for ≥6 months (to reduce immortal time bias) 
were included in group A-1 if bevacizumab had ever been skipped due to 
bevacizumab AESIs or to group A-2 otherwise. Efficacy analyses included overall 
survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) by whether bevacizumab was 
skipped (group A-1 vs. A-2). PFS was evaluated per independent review facility 
(IRF)-assessed Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 
1.1 and HCC-modified RECIST (IRF-HCC mRECIST). Safety was also evaluated.
RESULTS: Of the 210 patients who received ≥6 months of atezolizumab + 
bevacizumab, 69 were assigned to group A-1 and 141 to A-2. At data cutoff 
(August 20, 2020), hazard ratio (HR) for OS was 1.04 (95% CI: 0.64, 1.69) for 
group A-1 versus A-2. HR for PFS was 1.07 (95% CI: 0.74, 1.55) per IRF-assessed 
RECIST 1.1 and 1.10 (95% CI: 0.76, 1.59; 15.5 vs. 9.7 months) per IRF-HCC 
mRECIST for group A-1 versus A-2. Safety profiles for atezolizumab and 
bevacizumab were largely similar between groups. More group A-1 patients had 
grade 3/4 adverse events. A separate analysis investigating the impact of 
immortal time bias in patients who received ≥3 months of atezolizumab + 
bevacizumab supported the appropriateness of the ≥6-month landmark analysis.
DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Efficacy was similar between patients who skipped 
bevacizumab due to bevacizumab AESIs and those who did not. Although this 
comparison was nonrandomized and exploratory, results suggest that skipping

INTRODUCTION: We aimed to characterize the initial healthcare journey of 
metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (mPDAC) patients in Portugal, 
including healthcare provision and factors affecting therapeutic decisions, 
namely BRCA mutations testing.
METHODS: This is a descriptive cross-sectional, web-based survey using a 
convenience sampling approach. Portuguese oncologists and pathologists that 
routinely work with mPDAC patients from the different geographical regions and 
settings were invited to participate in the study via email (December 2020). 
Descriptive statistical analyses were performed, with categorical variables 
reported as absolute and relative frequencies, and continuous variables with 
non-normal distribution as median and interquartile range (IQR) (Stata v.15.0).
RESULTS: Seventy physicians participated in the study (43 oncologists, 27 
pathologists). According to the responses, a median of 28 patients per center 
(IQR 12-70) was diagnosed with PDAC in the previous year; 22 of them referring 
(IQR 8-70) to mPDAC. The pointed median time from patients' first hospital 
admission until disease diagnosis/staging is between 2 and 4 weeks. Endoscopic 
ultrasound with fine-needle biopsy is available in most hospitals (86%). Around 
50% of physicians request BRCA testing; the assessment of additional biomarkers 
besides BRCA is requested by 40% of professionals. Half of them stated that BRCA 
testing should be requested earlier-upon histological diagnosis, especially 
because the median time for results is of 4.0 weeks (IQR 4-8). PARP inhibitors 
such as olaparib, when available, would be the therapy of choice for most 
oncologists (71%) if no disease' progression occurs after 4 months. Treatments' 
selection is usually grounded on clinical criteria (e.g., performance status, 
liver function). Around 45% of patients use FOLFIRINOX/mFOLFIRINOX as the 
first-line therapy. Gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel is used by 35% of patients as 
the second-line therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Physicians in Portugal support the increasing role of 
patient-tailored treatments in mPDAC, whose selection should be grounded on 
tumoral subtyping and molecular profiling. Further efforts to develop 
multidisciplinary teams, standardized clinical practice, and optimize the 
implementation of new target therapies are needed.

Publisher: INTRODUÇÃO: Este estudo teve como objetivo caracterizar o percurso 
inicial dos doentes com adenocarcinoma ductal pancreático metastático (ACDPm) em 
Portugal, incluindo a prestação de cuidados de saúde e determinação de fatores 
que afetam as decisões terapêuticas, nomeadamente o teste de mutações BRCA.
MÉTODOS: Trata-se de um estudo descritivo transversal (web-based) usando uma 
abordagem de amostragem por conveniência. Médicos oncologistas e 
anatomopatologistas portugueses dedicados ao ACDPm e de diferentes regiões 
geográficas e instituições foram convidados a participar do estudo por email 
(Dez-2020). Foram realizadas análises estatísticas descritivas, com variáveis 
categóricas relatadas como frequências absolutas e relativas, e variáveis 
contínuas com distribuição não-normal como mediana e intervalo interquartil 
(IIQ) (Stata v.15.0).
RESULTADOS: Setenta médicos participaram do estudo (43 oncologistas, 27 
patologistas). De acordo com as respostas, uma mediana de 28 doentes por centro 
(IIQ 12–70) foi diagnosticada com ACDP no ano anterior; 22 deles (IIQ 8–70) 
referentes a ACDPm. O tempo médio desde a primeira admissão hospitalar dos 
doentes até o diagnóstico/estadiamento da doença foi entre 2–4 semanas. A 
ultrassonografia endoscópica com biópsia por agulha fina é realizada pela 
maioria dos hospitais (86%). Aproximadamente 50% dos médicos referem solicitar o 
teste BRCA; a avaliação de biomarcadores adicionais além do BRCA é solicitada 
por 40% dos profissionais. Metade dos médicos assume que o teste BRCA deveria 
ser solicitado mais precocemente – durante o diagnóstico histológico, 
principalmente porque o tempo médio para obtenção do resultado é de 4,0 semanas 
(IIQ 4–8). Os inibidores PARP, como o olaparibe, quando disponíveis, seriam a 
terapia de escolha para a maioria dos oncologistas (71%) caso não haja 
progressão da doença após quatro meses. A seleção dos tratamentos é usualmente 
baseada em critérios clínicos (por exemplo, performance status, função 
hepática). Em cerca de 45% dos doentes é utilizado FOLFIRINOX/mFOLFIRINOX como 
terapia de primeira linha. Um esquema com Gemcitabina + nab-paclitaxel é usado 
em 35% dos doentes como terapia de segunda linha.
CONCLUSÕES: Os médicos em Portugal apoiam o papel crescente do tratamento 
individualizado no ACDPm, cuja seleção deve ser baseada na subtipagem tumoral e 
no perfil molecular. São necessários mais esforços para capacitar as equipas 
multidisciplinares, desenvolver práticas clínicas padronizadas e otimizar a 
implementação de novas terapias-alvo.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) stands as a profoundly heterogeneous and 
aggressive malignancy, manifesting a discouragingly limited response to 
conventional therapeutic interventions. Within the intricate tapestry of the 
tumor microenvironment (TME), cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) emerge as 
pivotal constituents, wielding the capacity to propel the malignant attributes 
of neoplastic cells while bolstering their deftness in thwarting treatments. The 
rapid evolution of nanomedicinal technologies ushers in fresh avenues for 
therapeutic paradigms meticulously honed to target CAFs. Notably, a recent 
proposition by Yuan et al. introduces a PDAC treatment strategy metaphorically 
akin to "shooting fish in a barrel." By adeptly capitalizing on the spatial 
distribution of the CAF barricade encircling the tumor, this innovative approach 
orchestrates a metamorphosis of CAFs, transitioning them from impediments to 
drug delivery into reservoirs of therapeutic agents. The resultant outcome, an 
augmentation of chemotherapy and immunotherapy efficacy, attests to the 
transformative potential of this concept. The study not only bequeaths novel 
insights and methodologies to surmount barriers in drug delivery for tumor 
treatment but also holds promise in elevating the precision, efficacy, and 
safety of tailored therapeutic regimens. Within this discourse, we meticulously 
evaluate Yuan et al.'s research, scrutinizing its merits and limitations, and 
cast a forward-looking gaze upon the formulation, validation of efficacy, and 
clinical translation of nanomedicines targeting CAFs.

AIM: Neuroendocrine tumors are heterogenous group of neoplasms that includes 
benign and malignant tumors that originate from neuroendocrine or 
nonneuroendocrine organs. Insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1) is a zinc 
finger transcription factor originally isolated from subtraction library of 
human insulinoma. The main aim was to study the INSM1 expression in a spectrum 
of neuroendocrine tumors and a limited spectrum of nonneuroendocrine tumors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 100 cases of which 57 neuroendocrine neoplasms 
and 43 nonneuroendocrine neoplasms were included in the study. 
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was done and expression patterns of INSM1 were 
analyzed. Pituitary adenoma, medullary carcinoma of thyroid, pheochromocytoma 
lung, gastrointestinal, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors were the 
neuroendocrine tumors that were included in the study. Papillary carcinoma of 
thyroid, gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell 
carcinoma were the nonneuroendocrine tumors that were included in the study. 
Depending upon the tissue availability, comparison of INSM1 with synaptophysin 
and chromogranin was also done in few neuroendocrine tumors.
RESULTS: All the 57 neuroendocrine tumors showed positive expression for INSM1 
and all the nonneuroendocrine tumors were negative for INSM1. This study is 
statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that INSM1 is a diagnostic marker for 
neuroendocrine tumors with high degree of sensitivity and specificity. The study 
is significant and suggests that INSM1- IHC shows nuclear positivity in a 
spectrum of neuroendocrine tumors. Being a nuclear marker, interpretation is 
easy and more reliable than the cytoplasmic markers. INSM1 has a stronger 
positivity than synaptophysin and chromogranin in the present study especially 
for small cell carcinoma lung. Hence, INSM1 may be included in the routine panel 
for neuroendocrine tumors along with synaptophysin and chromogranin.

Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (panNETs) are a group of neoplasms with 
heterogenous biological and clinical phenotypes. Although historically regarded 
as rare, the incidence of these tumors has been increasing, mostly owing to 
improvements in the detection of small, asymptomatic tumors with imaging. The 
heterogeneity of these lesions creates significant challenges regarding 
diagnosis, staging, and treatment. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has improved the 
characterization of pancreatic lesions. Furthermore, EUS nowadays has evolved 
from a purely diagnostic modality to allow the performance of minimally invasive 
locoregional therapy for pancreatic focal lesions. The choice of treatment as 
well as the treatment goals depend on several factors, including tumor secretory 
status, grading, staging, and patient performance status. Surgery has been the 
mainstay for the management of these patients, particularly for localized, 
low-grade, large panNETs >2 cm. Over the last decade, a significant body of 
evidence has been accumulated evaluating the role of EUS for the ablative 
therapy of panNETs, namely by the use of chemoablative agents and 
radiofrequency. Although endoscopic techniques are not routinely recommended by 
international guidelines, they may be considered for the treatment of smaller 
lesions in patients who are unwilling or unfit for pancreatic surgery. In this 
review, we summarize the existing evidence on the interventional techniques for 
the treatment of patients with panNETs, focusing on the EUS-guided and surgical 
approaches.

Publisher: Os tumores neuroendócrinos do pâncreas (panNETs) são um grupo de 
neoplasias com comportamento biológico e clínico heterogéneo. Embora 
historicamente considerados raros, a incidência desses tumores tem aumentado, 
algo que se atribui principalmente à melhoria na deteção de pequenos tumores 
assintomáticos em exames de imagem. A heterogeneidade destas lesões cria 
desafios significativos no que respeita ao seu diagnóstico, estadiamento e 
tratamento. A ultrassonografia endoscópica melhorou a caracterização das lesões 
pancreáticas. Concomitantemente, a ultrassonografia endoscópica, para além da 
vertente diagnóstica, evoluiu no sentido do desenvolvimento de capacidades 
terapêuticas, permitindo a realização de terapêutica locorregional de lesões 
pancreáticas focais de forma minimamente invasiva.A seleção do tratamento, bem 
como a definição dos seus objetivos, depende de diversos fatores, incluindo a 
atividade secretora da neoplasia, a sua atividade mitótica, o estadiamento e o 
status funcional do doente. A cirurgia é considerada a pedra basilar do 
tratamento destes doentes, particularmente para panNETs localizados, de baixo 
grau, com >2 cm. Ao longo da última década foi gerado um conjunto significativo 
de evidência relativamente ao papel da ultrassonografia endoscópica na 
terapêutica ablativa dos panNETs, nomeadamente através da utilização de agentes 
quimioablativos e de radiofrequência. Embora as recomendações internacionais não 
recomendem a utilização rotineira destas técnicas para o tratamento dos panNETs, 
as mesmas podem ser consideradas no tratamento de lesões de menores dimensões em 
doentes que não desejem ou que sejam considerados inaptos para cirurgia 
pancreática. Esta revisão visa resumir a evidência existente relativa às 
técnicas de intervenção para o tratamento de pacientes com panNETs, com foco nas 
abordagens cirúrgica e guiada por ultrassonografia endoscópica.

Aging is a contributor to liver disease. Hence, the concept of liver aging has 
become prominent and has attracted considerable interest, but its underlying 
mechanism remains poorly understood. In our study, the internal mechanism of 
liver aging was explored via multi-omics analysis and molecular experiments to 
support future targeted therapy. An aged rat liver model was established with 
d-galactose, and two other senescent hepatocyte models were established by 
treating HepG2 cells with d-galactose and H2O2. We then performed transcriptomic 
and metabolomic assays of the aged liver model and transcriptome analyses of the 
senescent hepatocyte models. In livers, genes related to peroxisomes, fatty acid 
elongation, and fatty acid degradation exhibited down-regulated expression with 
aging, and the hepatokine Fgf21 expression was positively correlated with the 
down-regulation of these genes. In senescent hepatocytes, similar to the results 
found in aged livers, FGF21 expression was also decreased. Moreover, the 
expressions of cell cycle-related genes were significantly down-regulated, and 
the down-regulated gene E2F8 was the key cell cycle-regulating transcription 
factor. We then validated that FGF21 overexpression can protect against liver 
aging and that FGF21 can attenuate the declines in the antioxidant and 
regenerative capacities in the aging liver. We successfully validated the 
results from cellular and animal experiments using human liver and blood 
samples. Our study indicated that FGF21 is an important target for inhibiting 
liver aging and suggested that pharmacological prevention of the reduction in 
FGF21 expression due to aging may be used to treat liver aging-related diseases.

Transcriptional factor Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) plays an important role in 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) development and progression. The 
molecular mechanisms underlying its dysregulation remain unclear. We identified 
and functionally validated the microRNAs (miRNAs) that critically regulate FOXM1 
expression in PDAC. The expression levels of miRNA-23a (miR-23a-3p and -5p) were 
altered in PDAC cell lines and their effects on FOXM1 signaling and cell 
proliferation and migration and tumorigenesis were examined in vitro and in vivo 
using mouse PDAC models. Compared with non-tumor pancreatic tissues, PDAC 
tissues and cell lines exhibited significantly reduced levels of miR-23a 
expression. Reduced miR-23a expression and concomitant increase in FOXM1 
expression were also observed in acinar-to-ductal metaplasia and pancreatic 
intraepithelial neoplasia, the major premalignant lesions of PDAC. Transgenic 
expression of miR-23a reduced the expression of FOXM1 and suppressed cell 
proliferation and migration in PDAC cells, whereas the inhibitors of miR-23a did 
the opposite. Loss or reduced levels of miR-23a increased the levels of FOXM1 
expression, while increased expression of FOXM1 down-regulated miR-23a 
expression, suggesting that miR-23a and FOXM1 were mutual negative regulators of 
their expression in PDAC cells. Therefore, the miR-23a/FOXM1 signaling axis is 
important in PDAC initiation and progression and could serve as an 
interventional or therapeutic target for patients with early or late stages of 
PDAC.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Endoscopic treatment of obstructive jaundice and 
pancreatitis due to hepaticojejunostomy (H-J), pancreatojejunostomy (P-J) 
strictures, and tumor recurrence after pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) is technically 
challenging. Treatment of P-J strictures results in poor outcomes. Although 
conventional EUS that has an oblique view is not suitable for such patients, 
forward-viewing EUS (FV-EUS) may become a useful option. This study aimed to 
evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of FV-EUS in patients who have undergone 
PD.
METHODS: Patients with PD who were scheduled to undergo diagnosis and treatment 
using FV-EUS for H-J or P-J lesions were enrolled in this single-center 
prospective study. After observation of the P-J and H-J using FV-EUS according 
to a predetermined protocol, treatment using FV-EUS was performed as needed.
RESULTS: A total of 30 patients were enrolled, and FV-EUS was used to observe 
P-J and H-J in 24 and 28 patients, respectively. The detection rates of P-J and 
H-J by endoscopy were 50% (12/24) and 96.4% (27/28), respectively, and by EUS 
were 70.8% (17/24) and 100% (28/28), respectively. Of these, P-J and H-J were 
found by endoscopy only after EUS observation in 3 and 1 patient, respectively. 
The success rates of endoscopic treatment using FV-EUS were 66.7% (2/3), 95.2% 
(20/21), and 25% (1/4) for benign P-J strictures, benign H-J strictures, and 
tumor recurrence, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic treatment using FV-EUS is feasible and effective for 
patients after PD. Moreover, FV-EUS increases the P-J lesion detection rate by 
adding EUS observation.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) are rare and accounting for 
less than 5% of all pancreatic neoplasms. Their management depends on dimension 
of the lesion, main pancreatic duct (MPD) caliber, tumor malignancy features and 
evolutive potential.
CASE REPORT: Incidental finding of a lesion 1.2 cm wide of the pancreatic body, 
after contrast enhanced total body CT, in a 71 years old obese Caucasian male 
(BMI>25), during follow-up for cutaneous melanoma. The lesion was confirmed by 
MRI and 68-Ga pancreatic scintigraphy. EUS showed a second hypoecogenic and 
hypovascularized lesion compatible with pancreatic tail PNET. After FNB, Ki-67 
was below 3%.
DISCUSSION: 68-Gallium PET-CT was the preferred technique for the staging of the 
neuroendocrine neoplasm, for treatment planning, for the localization of the 
pancreatic lesion, excluding the presence of unknown extra-pancreatic lesions. 
EUS-FNB is indicated in patient with suspicion of PNET, although further 
investigation is needed to include it as a routine diagnostic examination.
CONCLUSION: Surgery is mandatory in case of PNETs larger than 2 cm, with MPD 
dilation, Ki-67>20% and compression symptoms.

INTRODUCTION: The phase III REFLECT trial demonstrated that lenvatinib was 
superior to sorafenib in terms of progression-free survival (PFS), time to 
progression, and objective response rate (ORR) for patients with unresectable 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study assessed the efficacy and safety of 
preoperative lenvatinib therapy for patients with oncologically or technically 
unresectable HCC.
METHODS: In this multicenter single-arm phase II trial, patients with advanced 
HCC and factors suggestive of a poor prognosis (macroscopic vascular invasion, 
extrahepatic metastasis, or multinodular tumors) were enrolled. Patients with 
these factors, even with technically resectable HCC, were defined as 
oncologically unresectable because of the expected poor prognosis after surgery. 
After 8 weeks of lenvatinib therapy, the patients were assessed for 
resectability, and tumor resection was performed if the tumor was considered 
technically resectable. The primary endpoint was the surgical resection rate. 
The secondary endpoints were the macroscopic curative resection rate, overall 
survival (OS), ORR, PFS, and the change in the indocyanine green retention rate 
at 15 min as measured before and after lenvatinib therapy. The trial was 
registered with the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (s031190057).
RESULTS: Between July 2019 and January 2021, 49 patients (42 oncologically 
unresectable patients and 7 technically unresectable patients) from 11 centers 
were enrolled. The ORR was 37.5% based on mRECIST and 12.5% based on RECIST 
version 1.1. Thirty-three patients underwent surgery (surgical resection rate: 
67.3%) without perioperative mortality. The surgical resection rate was 76.2% 
for oncologically unresectable patients and 14.3% for technically unresectable 
patients. The 1-year OS rate and median PFS were 75.9% and 7.2 months, 
respectively, with a median follow-up period of 9.3 months.
CONCLUSIONS: The relatively high surgical resection rate seen in this study 
suggests the safety and feasibility of lenvatinib therapy followed by surgical 
resection for patients with oncologically or technically unresectable HCC.

The immune system is an interacting network of plentiful molecules that could 
better characterize the relationship between immunity and cancer. This study 
aims to investigate the behavioral patterns of immune-related interaction 
perturbation networks in glioblastoma. An immune-related 
interaction-perturbation framework was introduced to characterize four 
heterogeneous subtypes using RNA-seq data of TCGA/CGGA glioblastoma tissues and 
GTEx normal brain tissues. The stability and robustness of the four subtypes 
were validated in public datasets and our in-house cohort. In the four subtypes, 
C1 was an inflammatory subtype with high immune infiltration, low tumor purity, 
and potential response to immunotherapy; C2, an invasive subtype, was featured 
with dismal prognosis, telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter mutations, 
moderate levels of immunity, and stromal constituents, as well as sensitivity to 
receptor tyrosine kinase signaling inhibitors; C3 was a proliferative subtype 
with high tumor purity, immune-desert microenvironment, sensitivity to 
phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase signaling inhibitor and DNA replication 
inhibitors, and potential resistance to immunotherapy; C4, a synaptogenesis 
subtype with the best prognosis, exhibited high synaptogenesis-related gene 
expression, prevalent isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations, and potential 
sensitivity to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Overall, this study provided an 
attractive platform from the perspective of immune-related interaction 
perturbation networks, which might advance the tailored management of 
glioblastoma.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer-related 
death in the United States. Despite advancements in surgery and chemoradiation 
therapies, pancreatic cancer has a 5-year survival rate of only 11% in the 
United States. Cryoablation is emerging as a new and effective therapy for 
locally advanced pancreatic cancer and symptom palliation in metastatic disease. 
To our knowledge, the occurrence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) 
after cryoablation is rare.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 47-year-old woman with no significant past medical history 
was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and underwent a Whipple procedure followed 
by chemotherapy with gemcitabine and paclitaxel. Due to the abdominal lymph 
nodes, peritoneum, right femur, and surrounding soft tissue metastases, she 
received systemic palliative chemotherapy with gemcitabine and paclitaxel and 
underwent right femur tumor excision, open reduction, and internal fixation, 
followed by radiation therapy. She continued to have persistent pain and 
underwent palliative percutaneous cryoablation of the metastatic tumor under 
computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound guidance. Immediately post procedure, 
she developed slow but continuous blood oozing at the ablation site, which was 
difficult to control despite compression dressings, reinforcement sutures, and 
local thrombin powder. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit 
where she was noted to be hypotensive and tachycardic, with petechiae in both 
lower extremities. Laboratory studies were consistent with DIC and peripheral 
blood smear revealed multiple schistocytes. CT angiogram of the right lower 
extremity did not show any bleeding vessel amenable to embolization. She was 
transfused red blood cells, platelets, fresh frozen plasma, and cryoprecipitate. 
Despite multiple daily transfusions, she continued to have pain and remained 
persistently thrombocytopenic and coagulopathic. After discussion with the 
patient and her family, she chose to transition to comfort care measures and 
died.
CONCLUSIONS: DIC is an unusual but life-threatening complication of advanced 
pancreatic cancer.

Pancreatic cancer is one of the common causes of cancer-associated mortality 
with a dismal overall prognosis which has remained virtually unchanged over 
decades. In the present era, the management of patients with pancreatic cancer 
involves a multi-disciplinary team of radiologists, gastroenterologists, 
surgical oncologists, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists and other 
specialists. The advancement of interventional endoscopy has made a significant 
impact in the management of pancreatic cancers. Since the inception of 
endoscopic ultrasound, it has evolved over the last few decades in the 
management of pancreatic malignancies and its role in staging and tissue 
acquisition is well established. There is an emerging role of endoscopic 
ultrasound in the treatment and palliation of unresectable pancreatic cancer. 
The aim of this article is to review the role of endoscopic ultrasound in 
diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in the current era.

There is no consensus on the utility of para-aortic lymph node dissection 
(PALND) in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) for periampullary 
cancer. The objective of this study was to assess survival in patients who 
underwent PD with PALND for pancreatic (PAC) and non-pancreatic (non-PAC) 
adenocarcinoma. All patients who underwent PD and PALND between 2011 and 2019 
were reviewed (n = 114). We looked at the impact of tumor type (PAC versus 
non-PAC) and pathologically confirmed PALN metastasis (PALNM) on overall 
survival (OS). Out of 114 patients, PALNM were pathologically confirmed in 
17(14.9%) patients. Without PALND, pathological staging would be pN0 in1(0.8%), 
pN1 in 3(2.5%), and pN2 in 13(11.2%) patients. The 30-day mortality was 3(2.6%) 
and 65(57%) patients received adjuvant treatment. The 4-year OS for PAC and 
non-PAC was 9% and 39% (P = 0.001). Advanced nodal involvement (pN2) was seen in 
14/17(82.4%) and 21/97(21.6%) patients with and without PALNM, respectively 
(P < 0.001). For PAC, 4-year OS for patients with pN0-N1, pN2, and PALNM was 
12%, 8%, and not reached (P = 0.067). For non-PAC, 4-year OS was 45%, 19%, and 
12% (P = 0.006). In patients with non-PAC, despite metastatic involvement of 
PALN, acceptable long-term survival can be achieved with curative resection. For 
PAC, survival benefit with curative resection remains questionable.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are noncoding RNA molecules with a heterogeneous 
structure consisting of 200 or more nucleotides. Because these noncoding RNAs 
are transcribed by RNA polymerase II, they have properties similar to messenger 
RNA (mRNA). Contrary to popular belief, the term "ncRNA" originated before the 
discovery of microRNAs. LncRNA genes are more numerous than protein-coding 
genes. They are the focus of current molecular research because of their pivotal 
roles in cancer-related processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, 
and migration. The incidence of pancreatic cancer (PC) is increasing around the 
world and research on the molecular aspects of PC are growing. In this review, 
it is aimed to provide critical information about lncRNAs in PC, including the 
biological and oncological behaviors of lncRNAs in PC and their potential 
application in therapeutic strategies and as diagnostic tumor markers.

INTRODUCTION: Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) with cisplatin and 
lenvatinib exhibits strong antitumor effects against advanced hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC). Higher antitumor activity is expected for the combination 
treatment. The aim of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
lenvatinib in combination with HAIC using cisplatin in patients with advanced 
HCC.
METHODS: In this multicenter, open-labeled, single-arm, phase II trial, patients 
with advanced HCC categorized as Child-Pugh class A with no prior history of 
systemic therapy were enrolled. Patients received lenvatinib plus HAIC with 
cisplatin (lenvatinib: 12 mg once daily for patients ≥60 kg, 8 mg once daily for 
patients <60 kg; HAIC with cisplatin: 65 mg/m2, day 1, every 4-6 weeks, maximum 
of six cycles). The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR) 
assessed using modified RECIST by the Independent Review Committee. The 
secondary endpoints were the ORR assessed using RECIST v1.1, progression-free 
survival, overall survival, and frequency of adverse events associated with the 
treatment.
RESULTS: A total of 36 patients were enrolled between September 2018 and March 
2020. In the 34 evaluable patients, the ORR assessed by the Independent Review 
Committee using modified RECIST and RECIST v1.1 were 64.7% (95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 46.5-80.3%) and 45.7% (95% CI: 28.8-63.4%), respectively. The 
median progression-free survival and overall survival were 6.3 months (95% CI: 
5.1-7.9 months) and 17.2 months (95% CI: 10.9 - not available, months), 
respectively. The main grade 3-4 adverse events were increased aspartate 
aminotransferase (34%), leukopenia (22%), increased alanine aminotransferase 
(19%), and hypertension (11%).
CONCLUSION: Lenvatinib plus HAIC with cisplatin yielded a favorable ORR and 
overall survival and was well tolerated in patients with advanced HCC. Further 
evaluation of this regimen in a phase III trial is warranted.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a devastating disease with poor 
survival rates. Here, we evaluated iron-doped hydroxyapatite (FeHA) as a 
potential nanomedicine-based approach to combat PDAC. FeHA, in combination with 
a sublethal dose of the glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) inhibitor RSL3, was 
found to trigger ferroptosis in KRAS mutant PANC-1 cells, but not in BxPC3 
cells, while sparing normal human cells (fibroblasts and peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells). These findings were recapitulated in 3D spheroids generated 
using PDAC cells harboring wild-type versus mutant KRAS. Moreover, ferroptosis 
induction by FeHA plus RSL3 was reversed by the knockdown of STEAP3, a 
metalloreductase responsible for converting Fe3+ to Fe2+. Taken together, our 
data show that FeHA is capable of triggering cancer cell death in a 
KRAS-selective, STEAP3-dependent manner in PDAC cells.

Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is among the most popular targets in nuclear 
medicine imaging and cancer theranostics. Several small-molecule moieties 
(FAPI-04, FAPI-46, etc.) are used for developing FAP-targeted theranostic 
agents. Nonetheless, the circulation time of FAP inhibitors is relatively short, 
resulting in rapid clearance via kidneys, low tumor uptake, and associated 
unsatisfactory treatment efficacy. To address the existing drawbacks, we 
engineered 3 peptides named FD1, FD2, and FD3 with different circulation times 
through solid-phase peptide synthesis. All the 3 reported peptides bind to human 
and murine FAP with single-digit nanomolar affinity measured by surface plasmon 
resonance. The diagnostic and therapeutic potential of the agents labeled with 
68Ga and 177Lu was assessed in several tumor models exhibiting different levels 
of FAP expression. While radiolabeled FD1 was rapidly excreted from kidneys, 
radiolabeled FD2/FD3 have significantly prolonged circulation, increased tumor 
uptake, and decreased kidney accumulation. Our findings indicated that 
[68Ga]Ga-DOTA-FD1 positron emission tomography (PET) effectively detected FAP 
dynamics, whereas [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-FD2 and [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-FD3 exhibited remarkable 
therapeutic efficacy in FAP-overexpressing tumor models, including pancreatic 
cancer cell models characterized by abundant stroma. Moreover, a pilot 
translational investigation demonstrated that [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-FD1 had the 
capability to identify both primary and metastatic tumors with precision and 
distinction. In summary, we developed [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-FD1 for same-day PET imaging 
of FAP dynamics and [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-FD2 and [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-FD3 for effective 
radioligand therapy of FAP-overexpressing tumors.

The prevailing desmoplastic stroma and immunosuppressive microenvironment within 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) pose substantial challenges to 
therapeutic intervention. Despite the potential of protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) 
inhibitors in mitigating the desmoplastic stromal response and enhancing the 
immune milieu, their efficacy is curtailed by suboptimal pharmacokinetics (PK) 
and insufficient tumor penetration. To surmount these hurdles, we have pioneered 
a novel strategy, employing lipid bilayer-coated mesoporous silica nanoparticles 
(termed "silicasomes") as a carrier for the delivery of Nintedanib. Nintedanib, 
a triple PTK inhibitor that targets vascular endothelial growth factor, 
platelet-derived growth factor and fibroblast growth factor receptors, was 
encapsulated in the pores of silicasomes via a remote loading mechanism for weak 
bases. This innovative approach not only enhanced pharmacokinetics and 
intratumor drug concentrations but also orchestrated a transformative shift in 
the desmoplastic and immune landscape in a robust orthotopic KRAS-mediated 
pancreatic carcinoma (KPC) model. Our results demonstrate attenuation of 
vascular density and collagen content through encapsulated Nintedanib treatment, 
concomitant with significant augmentation of the CD8+/FoxP3+ T-cell ratio. This 
remodeling was notably correlated with tumor regression in the KPC model. 
Strikingly, the synergy between encapsulated Nintedanib and anti-PD-1 
immunotherapy further potentiated the antitumor effect. Both free and 
encapsulated Nintedanib induced a transcriptional upregulation of PD-L1 via the 
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. In summary, our pioneering 
approach involving the silicasome carrier not only improved antitumor 
angiogenesis but also profoundly reshaped the desmoplastic stromal and immune 
landscape within PDAC. These insights hold excellent promise for the development 
of innovative combinatorial strategies in PDAC therapy.

Calcifying fibrous tumor (CFT) is a rare benign lesion of mesenchymal origin 
that may present similar characteristics to other more common tumors. We present 
the case of a 36-year-old woman with a tumor in the proximal jejunum, initially 
suspected to be a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). Surgical resection was 
performed, revealing a well-demarcated nodule at the anti-mesenteric border with 
microscopic features typical of a calcifying fibrous tumor. The tumor cells were 
positive for CD34 and negative for other markers, differentiating it from other 
neoplasms. Calcifying fibrous tumors can be confused with more common tumors 
because of its appearance, but an accurate diagnosis supported by 
immunohistochemistry is essential. Complete surgical excision is usually 
curative.

CYP3A5 is a cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme that metabolizes drugs and contributes 
to drug resistance in cancer. However, it remains unclear whether CYP3A5 
directly influences cancer progression. In this report, we demonstrate that 
CYP3A5 regulates glucose metabolism in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. 
Multi-omics analysis showed that CYP3A5 knockdown results in a decrease in 
various glucose-related metabolites through its effect on glucose transport. A 
mechanistic study revealed that CYP3A5 enriches the glucose transporter GLUT1 at 
the plasma membrane by restricting the translation of TXNIP, a negative 
regulator of GLUT1. Notably, CYP3A5-generated reactive oxygen species were 
proved to be responsible for attenuating the AKT-4EBP1-TXNIP signaling pathway. 
CYP3A5 contributes to cell migration by maintaining high glucose uptake in 
pancreatic cancer. Taken together, our results, for the first time, reveal a 
role of CYP3A5 in glucose metabolism in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and 
identify a novel mechanism that is a potential therapeutic target.

BACKGROUND: Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPNs) of the pancreas are indolent 
rare tumors with malignant potential. The risk factors associated with the 
malignant behavior of SPNs are still unclear.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients with SPNs who underwent surgical 
treatment in the First Hospital of Jilin University from January 2010 to January 
2022 was conducted. The clinical baseline data, pathology, imaging, and 
laboratory indicators of the patients were analyzed by univariate and 
multivariate logistic regression to identify the independent risk factors 
associated with the high-risk groups, and a predictive model was established in 
the form of a nomogram.
RESULTS: In multivariate analysis, clinical symptoms (P < 0.001), unclear tumor 
margins (P = 0.001), incomplete tumor capsules (P = 0.005), maximum tumor 
diameters ≥ 7.2 cm (P = 0.003), and prognostic nutritional index values < 47.45 
(P = 0.007) were independent risk factor for SPNs with high-risk groups. A 
nomogram model was successfully established to predict high-risk groups of SPNs. 
The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.856. The 
calibration prediction curve was in good agreement with the standard curve.
CONCLUSION: The nomogram model based on clinical symptoms, inflammatory markers, 
and imaging features had a high application value in the preoperative prediction 
of the high-risk groups of SPNs. A novel nomogram of the affiliated hospital of 
Jilin University-SPNs risk model was proposed for routine application to guide 
the patient counseling in clinical practice.

INTRODUCTION: Naples prognostic score (NPS) based on nutritional and 
inflammatory parameters can predict response to chemotherapy and overall 
survival (OS) in many cancer types. However, its significance in metastatic 
pancreatic cancer (PC) remains unclear. We evaluated the prognostic significance 
of the NPS in patients with metastatic PC receiving first line chemotherapy.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 215 patients with metastatic PC receiving 
first line FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy. NPS's were calculated using pre-chemotherapy 
laboratory data. Patients were divided into three groups according to their 
scores (NPS: 0; 1 & 2; 3 & 4 were grouped as 1, 2 and 3, respectively). The 
association of NPS with clinicopathological features and OS were evaluated.
RESULTS: Median age was 64 years, and median OS was 10.5 months. Hemoglobin 
levels were lower and Ca-19-9 values were higher with increasing NPS. Frequency 
of patients with bone and/or liver metastases, and with greater than 5 
metastatic focus were higher in group 3. A lower NPS was associated with longer 
OS. The median OS in groups 1, 2, and 3 were 19.5, 12, and 8 months, 
respectively, and differed significantly. Univariate analysis revealed effect of 
NPS (3-4) on OS (HR: 2.38, 1.77-3.19). Other prognostic factors affecting OS 
were age, ECOG, liver, bone or lymph node metastases, number of metastatic foci 
(<5 vs >5), de-novo metastatic disease, and serum Ca-19-9 levels. NPS (3-4) was 
identified as an independent prognostic factor negatively affecting OS (HR: 
1.89, 1.34-2.65) in multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSION: NPS may be a useful prognostic marker for the prediction of OS in 
metastatic PC patients receiving systemic chemotherapy.

BACKGROUND: There is limited data with regard to the use of modified 
5-fluoroural-leucovorin-irinotecan-oxaliplatin (mFOLFIRINOX) in terms of 
tolerance and enabling total mesorectal excision (TME) of locally advanced 
rectal adenocarcinomas (LARC) with high-risk characteristics (T4b status, signet 
ring histology etc) post standard neoadjuvant long course chemoradiation 
(NACTRT) or short course radiation (SCRT) and chemotherapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with LARC from January 2018 to December 2020 
receiving mFOLFIRINOX post NACTRT/SCRT to facilitate TME were evaluated. The 
primary endpoint was assessment of grade 3 and grade 4 treatment related 
toxicity and TME rates. Event free survival (EFS), where event was defined as 
disease progression or recurrence post resection after mFOLFIRINOX, was 
calculated by Kaplan Meier method.
RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were evaluated with a median age of 33 years 
(Range:18-59), 45% T4b status, 96% radiological circumferential margin (CRM) 
involved (79% CRM positive post NACTRT/SCRT), 43% extramural venous invasion 
(n=33) and 36% signet ring histology. 62% had received prior NACTRT and 38% had 
received SCRT with chemotherapy before receiving mFOLFIRINOX. The most common 
grade 3 and grade 4 treatment related side effects included diarrhoea (7%), 
anaemia (4%) and infections (4%). Intended duration of mFOLFIRINOX or beyond was 
completed in 94% of patients. 60% of patients underwent curative local resection 
with R0 resection rates of 100% (n=28) and pathological complete response rates 
of 21%. The most common surgeries done were exenterations and abdominoperineal 
in 22% and 17% patients respectively. With a median follow up of 19 months, 24 
patients had recurred or progressed for a median EFS of 20 months [95% 
confidence interval (CI): 15-24].
CONCLUSIONS: Locally advanced rectal cancers with high-risk characteristics are 
a niche group of cancers with less-than-optimal outcomes post standard 
neoadjuvant strategies. mFOLFIRINOX appears to be well tolerated and enables TME 
in a significant proportion of these patients.

Gemcitabine is frequently utilized to treat pancreatic cancer. The purpose of 
our study was to create a gemcitabine-resistant MIA-PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer 
cell line (MIA-GR100) and to evaluate the anti-pancreatic cancer efficacy of 
HMJ-38, a new quinazolinone analogue. Compared to their parental counterparts, 
MIA-PaCa-2, established MIA-GR100 cells were less sensitive to gemcitabine. 
MIA-GR100 cell viability was not affected by 10, 50 and 100 nM gemcitabine 
concentrations. HMJ-38 reduced MIA-GR100 cell growth and induced autophagy and 
apoptosis. When stained with monodansylcadaverine (MDC), acridine orange (AO), 
and terminal deoxynucleotide transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), 
MIA-GR100 cells shrunk, punctured their membranes, and produced autophagy 
vacuoles and apoptotic bodies. Combining chloroquine (CQ) and 3-methyladenine 
(3-MA) with HMJ-38 dramatically reduced cell viability, indicating that 
autophagy function as a cytoprotective mechanism. MIA-GR100 cells treated with 
both z-VAD-FMK and HMJ-38 were much more viable than those treated with HMJ-38 
alone. HMJ-38 promotes apoptosis in MIA-GR100 cells by activating caspases. 
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is one of HMJ-38's principal targets, as 
determined via in silico target screening with network prediction. HMJ-38 also 
inhibited EGFR kinase activity and EGFR-associated signaling in MIA-GR100 cells. 
HMJ-38 may be an effective chemotherapeutic adjuvant for gemcitabine-resistant 
pancreatic cancer cells, in which it induces an antitumor response.

Gastric carcinoma is the fifth most common and the third leading cause of cancer 
deaths worldwide. The incidence of diffuse-type gastric cancer, of which signet 
ring cell carcinoma is a subtype, is rising in the world. Due to non-specific 
gastritis-like symptoms, difficulty in assessing true tumor characteristics 
owing to its horizontal spread, and non-distinguishable endoscopic appearance 
from other gastric pathologies, the diagnosis of this subtype is challenging. We 
present a case of a 67-year-old woman with progressively worsening abdominal 
pain who came for an endoscopic ultrasound evaluation of an incidentally noted 
pancreatic cyst on a previous MRI. During endoscopy, a 1-cm gastric ulcer was 
noted along the lesser curvature of the gastric body. Biopsy confirmed a 
diagnosis of gastric signet ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) with CDX-2 and keratin 
positivity. The patient underwent total gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y 
reconstruction. Gross specimen revealed a diffuse SRCC invading the muscularis 
propria, along with lymphovascular and perineural invasion. In the context of 
our case, we discuss the morphological features of SRCC and the effectiveness of 
treatment options based on existing literature. Early accurate diagnosis and 
staging play an important role in determining treatment options as well as the 
clinical course of gastric SRCC.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is often chemotherapy-resistant, and 
novel drug combinations would fill an unmet clinical need. Previously we 
reported synergistic cytotoxic effects of gemcitabine and trabectedin on 
pancreatic cancer cells, but underlying protein-level interaction mechanisms 
remained unclear. We employed a reliable, sensitive, comprehensive, 
quantitative, high-throughput IonStar proteomic workflow to investigate the time 
course of gemcitabine and trabectedin effects, alone and combined, upon 
pancreatic cancer cells. MiaPaCa-2 cells were incubated with vehicle (controls), 
gemcitabine, trabectedin, and their combinations over 72 hours. Samples were 
collected at intervals and analyzed using the label-free IonStar liquid 
chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) workflow to provide temporal 
quantification of protein expression for 4,829 proteins in four experimental 
groups. To characterize diverse signal transduction pathways, a comprehensive 
systems pharmacodynamic (SPD) model was developed. The analysis is presented in 
two parts. Here, Part I describes drug responses in cancer cell growth and 
migration pathways included in the full model: receptor tyrosine kinase- (RTK), 
integrin-, G-protein coupled receptor- (GPCR), and calcium-signaling pathways. 
The developed model revealed multiple underlying mechanisms of drug actions, 
provides insight into the basis of drug interaction synergism, and offers a 
scientific rationale for potential drug combination strategies.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a poor prognosis and is 
highly metastatic. Our prior studies have demonstrated the critical role of axon 
guidance pathway genes in PDAC and the connection between neuronal development 
and the tumor microenvironment. A recent study newly identified 20 neuronal 
development genes [disks large homolog 2 (DLG2), neuron-glial-related cell 
adhesion molecule (NRCAM), neurexin3 (NRXN3), mitogen-activated protein kinase 
10 (MAPK10), platelet-derived growth factor D (PDGFD), protein kinase C epsilon 
(PRKCE), potassium calcium-activated channel subfamily M alpha 1 (KCNMA1), 
polycystic kidney and hepatic disease 1 (PKHD1), neural cell adhesion molecule 1 
(NCAM1), neuregulin-1 (NRG1), zinc finger protein 667 (ZNF667), cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), acyl-CoA medium-chain synthetase-3 
(ACSM3), complement 6 (C6), protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type M 
(PTPRM), hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1A), adenylyl cyclase 5 (ADCY5), 
adherens junctions-associated protein 1 (AJAP1), neurobeachin (NBEA), sodium 
voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 9 (SCN9A)] that are associated with 
perineural invasion and poor prognosis of PDAC. The relationship between genetic 
alterations in these 20 genes and tumor immune microenvironment (TME) has not 
previously been investigated.
METHODS: We hence applied the sequential multiplex immunohistochemistry results 
of biopsy specimens from 63 PDAC patients to investigate this relationship.
RESULTS: We found that, except for PTPRM and NBEA, genetic alterations involving 
these 20 genes are associated with significant changes in the densities of major 
immune cell subtypes. Except for AJAP1, the copy number loss involving this 
panel of neuronal development genes is significantly associated with changes in 
immune cell infiltrates. In contrast, the copy number gain in fewer genes, 
including NRXN3, ZNF667, ACSM3, C6, ADCY5, SCN9A, and PRKCE, is significantly 
associated with changes in immune cell infiltrates.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that neuronal development genes play a role in 
modulating TME in a pancreatic cancer setting.

Pancreatic cancer, one of the most aggressive malignancies, has no effective 
treatment due to the lack of targets and drugs related to tumour metastasis. 
SIRT6 can promote the migration of pancreatic cancer and could be a potential 
target for antimetastasis of pancreatic cancer. However, highly selective and 
potency SIRT6 inhibitor that can be used in vivo is yet to be discovered. Here, 
we developed a novel SIRT6 allosteric inhibitor, compound 11e, with maximal 
inhibitory potency and an IC50 value of 0.98 ± 0.13 μmol/L. Moreover, compound 
11e exhibited significant selectivity against other histone deacetylases 
(HADC1‒11 and SIRT1‒3) at concentrations up to 100 μmol/L. The allosteric site 
and the molecular mechanism of inhibition were extensively elucidated by 
cocrystal complex structure and dynamic structural analyses. Importantly, we 
confirmed the antimetastatic function of such inhibitors in four pancreatic 
cancer cell lines as well as in two mouse models of pancreatic cancer liver 
metastasis. To our knowledge, this is the first study to reveal the in vivo 
effects of SIRT6 inhibitors on liver metastatic pancreatic cancer. It not only 
provides a promising lead compound for subsequent inhibitor development 
targeting SIRT6 but also provides a potential approach to address the challenge 
of metastasis in pancreatic cancer.

Cancer, a complex and heterogeneous disease, arises from genomic instability. 
Currently, DNA damage-based cancer treatments, including radiotherapy and 
chemotherapy, are employed in clinical practice. However, the efficacy and 
safety of these therapies are constrained by various factors, limiting their 
ability to meet current clinical demands. Metal nanoparticles present promising 
avenues for enhancing each critical aspect of DNA damage-based cancer therapy. 
Their customizable physicochemical properties enable the development of targeted 
and personalized treatment platforms. In this review, we delve into the design 
principles and optimization strategies of metal nanoparticles. We shed light on 
the limitations of DNA damage-based therapy while highlighting the diverse 
strategies made possible by metal nanoparticles. These encompass targeted drug 
delivery, inhibition of DNA repair mechanisms, induction of cell death, and the 
cascading immune response. Moreover, we explore the pivotal role of 
physicochemical factors such as nanoparticle size, stimuli-responsiveness, and 
surface modification in shaping metal nanoparticle platforms. Finally, we 
present insights into the challenges and future directions of metal 
nanoparticles in advancing DNA damage-based cancer therapy, paving the way for 
novel treatment paradigms.

The treatment of advanced-stage pancreatic cancers is limited. Previous studies 
have found that the use of modulated electro-hyperthermia (mEHT) is beneficial 
in this patient population. However, there is no data on the optimal treatment 
number and initiation period. Therefore, a retrospective study was conducted 
with the inclusion of 96 mEHT-treated and 86 age- and sex-matched control 
pancreatic cancer patients. 76, 57, 38 and 33 patient pairs were enrolled into 
propensity score matched cohorts, whether they received at least 10, 20, 30 and 
40 mEHT treatments, respectively. The survival of patients with at least 30 (HR: 
0.5011; p = 0.0041) and 40 (HR: 0.5048; p = 0.0085) mEHT treatments was 
significantly longer, median survival was almost twice as long (10 vs. 18 
months). The introduction of mEHT had the greatest benefit in the first (HR: 
0.5382; p = 0.0056) and second (HR: 0.7861; p = 0.0031) 6 months after 
diagnosis.

This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of chemotherapy in different 
histological types of pancreatic cancer using data collected from the 
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Patients who were 
diagnosed with pancreatic cancer between 2004 and 2015 were selected from the 
SEER database. Propensity score matching (PSM) was employed to minimize the 
selection bias. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves and the log-rank test were 
utilized to compare the overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) 
among different groups. Of the 7,653 pancreatic cancer patients, both OS and CSS 
were higher in the chemotherapy group than those in the non-chemotherapy group 
(p < 0.001). After PSM, 2381 pairs were generated. The Kaplan-Meier survival 
curved indicated that both OS and CSS for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 
(PDAC), pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma (PASC), and pancreatic 
mucin-producing adenocarcinoma (PMPAC) (p < 0.001) in the chemotherapy group 
were superior to those in the non-chemotherapy group, while there was no 
significant difference in pancreatic mucinous adenocarcinoma (PMAC) 
(p = 0.2586). Compared with PASC and PMPAC, PDAC exhibited longer OS and CSS. 
The results of statistical analysis showed that PASC tumors were mainly poorly 
differentiated, and the majority of patients with PMPAC had distant metastasis. 
Chemotherapy could prolong pancreatic cancer patients' survival, especially for 
patients with advanced disease. PMPAC patients had a higher rate of metastasis, 
accompanying with the worse survival.

BACKGROUND: Safer and more effective drugs are needed for the treatment of acute 
pancreatitis (AP). Qingjie Huagong decoction (QJHGD) has been applied to treat 
AP for many years and has shown good clinical effects. However, the potential 
mechanism has not yet been determined.
PURPOSE: To investigate the role and underlying mechanism of the effects of 
QJHGD on AP both in vitro and in vivo.
METHODS: QJHGD was characterized by UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS. The protective effect 
of QJHDG and the underlying mechanism were investigated in MPC-83 cells in 
vitro. A caerulein-induced AP model was established to evaluate the protective 
effect of QJHGD in mice. CCK-8 assays were used to detect cell viability. The 
contents of inflammatory mediators were determined by ELISA. Expression levels 
of circRNA, miRNA and mRNA were determined by qRT-PCR. Protein expression was 
determined using Western blot. Pancreatic tissues were assessed by hematoxylin 
and eosin staining as well as immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence 
analyses. Pull-down and luciferase activity assays were performed to determine 
the regulatory relationships of circHipk3, miR-193a-5p and NLRP3.
RESULTS: Our results confirmed that mmu-miR-193a-5p was sponged by 
mmu-circHipk3, and NLRP3 was a target of miR-193a-5p. In vitro experiments 
showed that QJHGD enhanced MPC-83 cell viability by regulating circHipk3 
sponging mir-193a-5 targeting NLRP3 and inhibiting pyroptosis-related factors. 
Finally, we showed that QJHGD ameliorated pancreatic tissue injury in AP mice 
via this pathway.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrate that QJHDG exerted its anti-AP effects via 
the circHipk3/miR-193a-5p/NLRP3 pathway, revealing a novel mechanism for the 
therapeutic effect of QJHDG on AP.

Gastrointestinal cancers are one of the most frequent cancers and a leading 
cause of cancer deaths worldwide. We provide an overview of the most important 
practice-changing trials that were either published or presented at the 
international scientific meetings in 2021-2023. Highlights included reports on 
three phase III trials (CONCORDE/PRODIGE 26, ARTDECO, and a study by Xu et al.) 
that evaluated dose escalation in the definitive setting for locally advanced 
oesophageal cancers, as well as two phase III trials that evaluated the role of 
chemotherapy (neo-AEGIS) and targeted therapy (NRG/RTOG 1010) in the neoadjuvant 
setting for adenocarcinoma oesophageal cancers or gastroesophageal junction 
cancer. CheckMate 577 evaluated nivolumab in patients who had residual 
pathological disease after neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by complete 
resection. The use of radiation therapy for borderline and locally advanced 
pancreatic cancer is also discussed (SMART and CONKO-007 trials). Stereotactic 
body radiation therapy followed by sorafenib was compared to sorafenib alone in 
patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in the NRG/RTOG 1112 study. New options 
in the management of rectal cancer are emerging such as total neoadjuvant 
treatment (PRODIGE 23, RAPIDO, PROSPECT), organ preservation (OPRA, OPERA), and 
the role of immunotherapy in patients with DNA mismatch-repair 
deficient/microsatellite instability. Finally, preliminary results of the ACT 4 
trial that evaluated de-escalation in anal cancer are presented.

Duodenal gastrinoma - case report.

[Article in English]

Adamová Z, Chrostek M, Dvořák T, Rada E.

INTRODUCTION: In our text, we want to highlight a rare diagnosis.
CASE REPORT: A 54-year-old obese, hypertensive male smoker had been investigated 
for intermittent abdominal pain for 12 years. The first gastroscopy for a 
bleeding ulcer was conducted in 2010. In the subsequent years, repeated 
gastroscopies revealed variable involvement from the esophagus to the duodenum. 
Capsule enteroscopy did not provide further specification of the diagnosis. The 
patient underwent colonoscopy and MRI enterography multiple times, with no 
unequivocal pathological findings. In May 2022, he was admitted to our 
department for abdominal pain and vomiting. This time, gastroscopy revealed 
multiple small ulcers in the duodenum and jejunum with clots causing a 
mechanical obstruction. Chromogranin A was elevated, raising suspicion of 
gastrinoma. However, somatostatin receptor-based imaging (Octreoscan) was 
negative. Only the 68Ga-DOTATOC PET (positron emission tomography with the 
radiopharmaceutical DOTA, labeled with gallium-68) identified a lesion in the 
subhepatic region, which had no correlation on CT. We concluded the diagnosis as 
gastrinoma with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Endoscopically, a 1cm tumor was 
found in the duodenum. In October 2022, the patient underwent an excision of the 
duodenal wall, and the pathology assessment confirmed our diagnosis of 
gastrinoma.
CONCLUSION: With this case report, we want to emphasize the importance of taking 
into account neuroendocrine tumors in our differential diagnostic 
considerations. At the same time, we want to highlight that, according to ESMO 
recommendations, we should preferentially use 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT for the 
diagnosis instead of scintigraphic examination (111In-Octreoscan).

Pancreatic and bile duct metastases from esophageal cancer are extremely rare. 
We report a case of advanced esophageal cancer successfully treated with 
chemotherapy, selected on the basis of an accurate pathologic diagnosis. A 
69-year-old man with chronic renal dysfunction presented with persistent 
abdominal pain and anorexia. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed an 
irregular-shaped tumor in the lower esophagus. Computed tomography and 
ultrasonography revealed swollen para-aortic lymph nodes, a pancreatic mass, and 
distal bile duct stenosis. Histopathological examination showed that all of the 
lesions were squamous cell carcinoma with unique immunohistochemical 
characteristics of p40+ and cytokeratin 7+. The final diagnosis was esophageal 
squamous cell carcinoma accompanied by lymph node, pancreas, and bile duct 
metastases. Taking his renal dysfunction into consideration, modified FOLFOX was 
administered as the first-line chemotherapy. The patient survived for 15 months 
since his first presentation. The favorable outcome was attributed to the 
accurate diagnosis based on comprehensive tissue sampling.

BACKGROUND: Cancer growth is significantly influenced by processes such as 
pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis that underlie PANoptosis, a 
proinflammatory programmed cell death. Several studies have examined the long 
non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) associated with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD). 
However, the predictive value of lncRNAs related to PANoptosis for PAAD has not 
been established.
METHODS: The Clinical Genome Atlas database was used to obtain the transcriptome 
、clinical data and the corresponding mutation data of the patients with PAAD in 
this study. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression 
analysis was employed to obtain prognosis-related lncRNAs for constructing a 
risk signature. According to the median risk score of the signature, patients 
with PAAD were grouped into low- and high-risk groups to further compare the 
survival prognosis of different risk groups. Time-dependent receiver operating 
characteristic curves, c-index analysis, nomograms, principal component analysis 
and univariate Cox and multivariate Cox regression were performed for the 
internal validation of the signature. In addition, enrichment analysis of 
different genes was performed using gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of 
Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. Lastly, differences in tumor mutation burden 
(TMB), immune function, tumor immune dysfunction and rejection (TIDE), and drug 
response were determined for the two risk groups.
RESULTS: The signature was constructed with six PANoptosis-related lncRNAs 
(AC067817.2、LINC02004、AC243829.1、AC092171.5、AP005233.2、AC004687.1) that 
predicted the prognosis of the patients with PAAD. Survival curves showed that 
patients in the two risk groups had statistically significant differences in 
prognosis (P < 0.05), and multi-cox regression analysis identified risk score as 
an independent risk factor for PAAD prognosis, and internal validation of 
nomograms showed high confidence in the signature. GO and KEGG enrichment 
analysis showed functional and pathway differences between the high- and 
low-risk groups. TMB evaluation demonstrated that patients in the high-risk 
group had a higher frequency of mutations. The TIDE score indicated that the 
high-risk group had a lower risk of immunotherapy escape and better 
immunotherapy outcomes. Additionally, the two risk groups revealed significantly 
different responses to 11 anticancer drugs.
CONCLUSION: We identified a novel risk signature for PANoptosis-related lncRNAs, 
which is a standalone prognostic indicator for PAAD. The PANoptosis-related 
lncRNA risk signature may be relevant for immunotherapy and a therapeutic target 
for PAAD.

Irreversible Electroporation (IRE) is a non-thermal tumor ablation technique. 
High-voltage electrical pulses are applied between pairs of electrodes inserted 
around and/or inside a tumor. The generated electric current induces the 
creation of nanopores in the cell membrane, triggering apoptosis. As a result, 
IRE can be safely used in areas near delicate vascular structures where other 
thermal ablation methods are contraindicated. Currently, IRE has demonstrated to 
be a successful ablation technique for pancreatic, renal, and liver tumors and 
is widely used as a focal therapeutic option for prostate cancer. The need for 
specific anesthetic management and accurate parallel placement of multiple 
electrodes entails a high level of complexity and great expertise from the 
interventional team is required. Nevertheless, IRE is a very promising technique 
with a remarkable systemic immunological capability and may impact on distant 
metastases (abscopal effect).

INTRODUCTION: Resection of pancreatic tissue is necessary for many pancreatic 
diseases. The most common form of cancer, pancreatic duct adenocarcinoma, 
manifests with early metastases and is thought to be resistant to other 
currently known treatment regimens. Such tumors present a complex and difficult 
management and handling challenge for a surgeon. Surgical resection affords a 
better prognosis with a median survival of 14-20 months following resection and 
up to 25% 5-year survival rates. In this study, data from 75 pancreatic 
resections for diverse malignant pancreatic lesions will be presented.
METHODS: At a teaching institute in Central India, this ongoing longitudinal 
study began in 2009 and was carried on till 2018. Only 75 of the 122 patients 
who underwent pancreatic resection were deemed appropriate for the current 
study. All patients were thoroughly examined after being admitted before being 
given the option of surgery. There were 22 female patients and 53 male patients. 
The age range for the group was 34-67 years. Results from a range of different 
malignancies and various pancreatic resection procedures are presented in this 
study.
RESULTS: One of the most aggressive cancers, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, responds 
to surgical treatment better than other alternative techniques. Out of 75 
patients in our series, 32 had pancreatic head cancer, 28 had periampullary 
cancer, 2 had duodenal cancer, 8 had distal cholangiocarcinoma, and 1 had 
mucin-producing cystadenocarcinoma. Four patients had pancreatic cancer in both 
the body and tail. Fifty-three men and 22 women, ages 34-67 years, Whipple's 
operation and distal pancreatectomy were the most frequent procedures. In our 
series, survival ranged from 18 to 24 months, and the 5-year survival rate was 
12%, which is primarily seen with periampullary carcinoma.
CONCLUSION: The sole option for long-term survival or a cure for pancreatic 
cancer is surgery. Chemoradiation is ineffective as a first line of treatment. 
However, some reports contend that palliative chemotherapy actually improves the 
quality of life. The biology of the illness rules and determines the result; the 
kind of surgery performed had no bearing on survival, morbidity, or fatality.
CONTEXT: The above study was taken up in the context of - pancreatic tumors and 
pathological types, how imaging helps in deciding the plan of surgical 
management without biopsy. Outcomes of pancreatic resections for pancreatic 
cancer.
SETTINGS AND DESIGN: In a suburban hospital which is a tertiary care center, 
this longitudinal prospective study was conducted from 2009 to 2018.

Publisher: Résumé Introduction: La résection du tissu pancréatique est 
nécessaire pour de nombreuses maladies pancréatiques. La forme de cancer la plus 
courante, l'adénocarcinome du canal pancréatique, se manifeste par des 
métastases précoces et on pense qu'elle est résistante aux autres schémas 
thérapeutiques actuellement connus. De telles tumeurs présentent un défi de 
gestion et de manipulation complexe et difficile pour un chirurgien. La 
résection chirurgicale offre un meilleur pronostic avec une survie médiane de 14 
à 20 mois après la résection et jusqu'à 25 % de taux de survie à 5 ans. Dans 
cette étude, les données de 75 résections pancréatiques pour diverses lésions 
pancréatiques malignes seront présentées. Méthodes: Dans un institut 
d'enseignement du centre de l'Inde, cette étude longitudinale en cours a débuté 
en 2009 et s'est poursuivie jusqu'en 2018. Seuls 75 des 122 patients ayant subi 
une résection pancréatique ont été jugés appropriés pour l'étude actuelle. Tous 
les patients ont été soigneusement examinés après leur admission avant de 
pouvoir subir une intervention chirurgicale. Il y avait 22 patients de sexe 
féminin et 53 patients de sexe masculin. La tranche d'âge du groupe était de 34 
à 67 ans. Les résultats d'une gamme de différentes tumeurs malignes et de 
diverses procédures de résection pancréatique sont présentés dans cette étude. 
Résultats: L'un des cancers les plus agressifs, l'adénocarcinome du pancréas, 
répond mieux au traitement chirurgical que les autres techniques alternatives. 
Sur les 75 patients de notre série, 32 avaient un cancer de la tête du pancréas, 
28 un cancer périampullaire, un cancer duodénal, 8 un cholangiocarcinome distal 
et 1 un cystadénocarcinome producteur de mucine. Quatre patients présentaient un 
cancer du pancréas au niveau du corps et de la queue. Cinquante-trois hommes et 
22 femmes, âgés de 34 à 67 ans, l'opération de Whipple et la pancréatectomie 
distale étaient les procédures les plus fréquentes. Dans notre série, la survie 
variait de 18 à 24 mois et le taux de survie à 5 ans était de 12 %, ce qui est 
principalement observé dans le carcinome périampullaire. Conclusion: La seule 
option pour survivre à long terme ou guérir le cancer du pancréas est la 
chirurgie. La chimioradiothérapie est inefficace en première intention. 
Cependant, certains rapports affirment que la chimiothérapie palliative améliore 
réellement la qualité de vie. La biologie de la maladie gouverne et détermine le 
résultat ; le type d'intervention chirurgicale pratiquée n'avait aucune 
incidence sur la survie, la morbidité ou le décès. Contexte: L'étude ci-dessus a 
été reprise dans le contexte des tumeurs pancréatiques et des types 
pathologiques, comment l'imagerie aide à décider du plan de prise en charge 
chirurgicale sans biopsie. Résultats des résections pancréatiques pour le cancer 
du pancréas. Paramètres et conception: Dans un hôpital de banlieue qui est un 
centre de soins tertiaires, cette étude prospective longitudinale a été menée de 
2009 à 2018. Mots-clés: Complications, résections pancréatiques, résultats.

&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Introduction:&lt;/b&gt; The determinants influencing the risk 
for complications of laparoscopic distal pancreatectomies (LDP) are not yet 
fully defined, thus we aimed to determine risk factors for serious perioperative 
morbidity after LDP with spleen preservation, LDP and radical antegrade modular 
pancreatosplenectomy for adenocarcinoma of the body and tail of the pancreas 
(RAMPS).&lt;/br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Material and methods:&lt;/b&gt; 
Retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients that underwent LDP between 
January 2019 and December 2022. The study group included cases of serious 
perioperative morbidity (III-V grades in Clavien-Dindo classification) during a 
30-day period after operation. The control group consisted of patients without 
serious perioperative morbidity. As many as 142 patients were included in the 
study.&lt;/br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; Serious perioperative 
morbidity was found in 33 (23.24%) operated patients, while mortality in 3 cases 
(2.11%). Serious perioperative morbidity after LDP with spleen preservation was 
found in 9/68 (13.2%) patients (27.3% of the perioperative morbidity group). 
Thirteen out of 51 patients, i.e. 25.5%, after LDP with splenectomy were 
included in the perioperative morbidity group (39.4%). Serious perioperative 
morbidity after RAMPS was found in 11/23 (47.8%) patients (33.3% of the 
perioperative morbidity group). In multivariate logistic regression, the need 
for splenectomy during pancreatectomy (OR 3.66, 95%CI 1.20-11.18) and tumor 
above 28 millimeters in size (OR 3.01, 95%CI 1.19-9.59) were independent risk 
factors for serious perioperative morbidity.&lt;/br&gt; 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/b&gt; The need for splenectomy during 
laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy and tumor size above 28 millimeters were 
independent risk factors for serious perioperative morbidity after laparoscopic 
distal pancreatectomies.&lt;/br&gt.

BACKGROUND: Natural orifice specimen extraction surgery (NOSES) has been widely 
applied to the treatment of colorectal cancer. This study aim to investigate the 
short-term and survival outcomes of transrectal specimen extraction after 
laparoscopic right hemicolectomy.
METHODS: From January 2016 to December 2021, a total of 166 consecutive patients 
with right colon cancer who underwent laparoscopic right hemicolectomy in Cancer 
Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Beijing Hospital were 
identified. Baseline data, perioperative parameters, anal function, inflammatory 
indicators and survival outcomes were collected and compared.
RESULTS: Totally, 24 patients who underwent transrectal NOSE were matched with 
24 patients who received conventional laparoscopic surgery (LAP). Patients in 
NOSES group had a significantly lower incidence of incision infection (0 vs 
20.8%, P=0.048), faster recovery of gastrointestinal function (2.1 vs 3,1 days, 
P=0.032) compared with those in LAP group. In addition, patients in the NOSE 
group experienced significantly less postoperative pain on POD1 (2.3 vs 4.4, 
P<0.001), POD3 (2.1 vs 3.9, P<0.001), and POD5 (1.7 vs 2.8, P=0.011). Regarding 
to anal function 6 months after surgery, no significant difference was observed 
in Wexner incontinence scale (9.8 vs 9.5, P=0.559) between the two groups. In 
terms of indicators of the inflammatory response, there were no significant 
differences in body temperature, neutrophils, and PCT levels between the two 
groups. However, CRP levels in the NOSES group on POD 3 (6.9 vs 5.1 mg/L, 
P=0.016) and POD 5 (3.8 vs 2.6 mg/L, P=0.027) were significantly higher than in 
the LAP group. With regarded to survival outcomes, patients in the NOSES group 
were similar to those in the LAP group for 3-year OS (100% vs 91.2%, P=0.949), 
3-year DFS (86.2% vs 84.8%, P=0.949), and 3-year LRFS (94.2% vs 88.7%, P=0.549).
CONCLUSION: For total laparoscopic right hemicolectomy, transrectal NOSE is 
effective and safe, and associated with lower incidence of wound infection, less 
pain, faster recovery, and similar survival outcomes compared to conventional 
laparoscopic surgery.

INTRODUCTION: Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the standard treatment 
for unresectable intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but 
recurrence after TACE is common. The present phase 2, prospective, multicenter, 
single-arm trial, the TACTICS-L trial, investigated the efficacy and safety of 
TACE plus lenvatinib (LEN), a drug that more strongly promotes vascular 
normalization and has a better objective response rate (ORR) than sorafenib 
(jRCTs031180074).
METHODS: Participants were patients with HCC who had not previously received 
systemic therapy, hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy, or immunotherapy and 
who were ineligible for resection or percutaneous ablation therapy. LEN was to 
be administered 14-21 days before the first TACE, stopped 2 days before TACE, 
and resumed 3 days after TACE. Key inclusion criteria were unresectable HCC, 
Child-Pugh A liver function, 0-2 prior TACE sessions, tumor size ≤10 cm, number 
of tumors ≤10, and ECOG performance status 0-1. Key exclusion criteria were 
vascular invasion and extrahepatic spread. The primary endpoint was 
progression-free survival (PFS) by RECICL, and secondary endpoints were time to 
untreatable progression, ORR, overall survival (OS), and safety.
RESULTS: A total of 62 HCC patients were enrolled in this trial. The median age 
was 72 years, 77.4% of patients were men, and 95.2% had PS 0. The primary 
endpoint of median PFS was 28.0 months (90% confidence interval [CI] 25.1-31.0) 
after a minimum 24 months of follow-up. The secondary endpoint of median OS was 
not reached (90% CI 35.5 months-NR). LEN-TACE achieved a high response rate and 
high complete response (CR) rate (4 weeks after the first TACE: ORR 79.0%, CR 
rate 53.2%; best response: ORR 88.7%, CR rate 67.7%) by RECICL. Exploratory 
subgroup analyses showed that the characteristics of responders/nonresponders 
(ORR and CR rate) were similar and that LEN-TACE would be effective in all 
subgroups, including the population in whom TACE alone would be less likely to 
be curative (e.g., patients with the non-simple nodular type or a high tumor 
burden). The relative dose intensity of LEN before the first TACE was important 
for achieving higher CR rate/ORR by LEN-TACE. No new safety concerns were 
observed.
CONCLUSION: The results of this trial provide encouraging evidence, supporting 
the efficacy and favorable safety profile of LEN-TACE in patients who are 
ineligible for locoregional therapy.

CHST12: a potential prognostic biomarker related to the immunotherapy response 
in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) is characterized by lower 
immunogenicity with a poor response rate to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) 
and exhibits the poorest prognosis of all solid tumors, which results in the 
highest tumor-related mortality among malignancies. However, the underlying 
mechanisms are poorly understood. In addition, diverse carbohydrate 
sulfotransferases (CHSTs), which are involved in the sulfation process of these 
structures, play an important role in the metastatic spread of tumor cells. 
Aberrant glycosylation is beginning to emerge as an influencing factor in tumor 
immunity and immunotherapy. Therefore, it might serve as a biomarker of the 
immunotherapeutic response in tumors. The purpose of the study was to evaluate 
the role of CHST12 in PAAD prognosis and its relevance to the immunotherapeutic 
response.
METHODS: A comprehensive investigation of the interactions between CHST12 
expression and the immune microenvironment as well as the clinical significance 
of CHST12 in PAAD was conducted. Data derived from the Cancer Genome Atlas 
(TCGA) database were analyzed using univariate and multivariate approaches, the 
Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER), and Tumor Immune Dysfunction and 
Exclusion (TIDE) algorithms. Publicly available datasets were analyzed in this 
study. These data can be found on websites such as http://www.xiantao.love and 
https://www.proteinatlas.org. An assessment of the predictive value of CHST12 
for PAAD prognosis was conducted using univariate and multivariate Cox 
regression analysis, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and nomograms. The TIMER algorithm 
calculates the proportions of six types of immune cells. The TIDE algorithm was 
used to indicate the characteristics of tumors that respond to ICI therapy.
RESULTS: The mRNA and protein levels of CHST12 showed the opposite trend. CHST12 
mRNA expression was significantly upregulated in PAAD. According to Cox 
regression analysis, CHST12 RNA expression acts as a protective factor for 
overall survival [hazard ratio (HR), 0.617, P < 0.04]. Functional annotation 
indicated that CHST12-associated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were 
related to the signaling activity of receptor tyrosine kinases and the 
regulation of ubiquitin-protein transferase. These are usually involved in tumor 
development and may be related to the treatment responses of immune checkpoint 
inhibitors (ICIs). There was significantly higher CHST12 mRNA expression in PAAD 
samples than in non-malignant samples.
CONCLUSIONS: In PAAD, elevated CHST12 mRNA expression might regulate immune cell 
infiltration into the tumor microenvironment (TME) and may predict clinical 
outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Hepatectomy is the preferred treatment for solitary hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) without macrovascular invasion and distant metastasis, but 
long-term survival remains unsatisfactory in certain patients. We sought to 
identify whether the grading severity of microscopic vascular invasion (MVI) was 
associated with recurrence and survival among patients with solitary HCC.
METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent hepatectomy for solitary HCC were 
identified from a multicenter prospectively-collected database. Patients were 
categorized into three groups according to the MVI grading system proposed by 
the Liver Cancer Pathology Group of China: M0 (no MVI), M1 (1-5 sites of MVI 
occurring ≤1.0 cm away from the tumor), and M2 (>5 sites occurring ≤1.0 cm or 
any site occurring >1 cm away from the tumor). Recurrence-free survival (RFS) 
and overall survival (OS) were compared among the groups.
RESULTS: Among 227 patients, 97 (42.7%), 83 (36.6%), and 47 (20.7%) patients had 
M0, M1, and M2, respectively. Median RFS rates among patients with M0, M1, and 
M2 were 38.3, 35.1, 11.6 months, respectively, while OS rates were 66.8, 62.3, 
30.6 months, respectively (both P<0.001). Multivariate Cox-regression analyses 
demonstrated that both M1 and M2 were independent risk factors for RFS (hazard 
ratio 1.20, 95% CI: 1.03-1.89, P=0.040; and hazard ratio 1.67, 95% CI: 
1.06-2.64, P=0.027) and OS (hazard ratio 1.28, 95% CI: 1.05-2.07, P=0.035; and 
hazard ratio 1.97, 95% CI: 1.15-3.38, P=0.013).
CONCLUSIONS: Grading severity of MVI was independently associated with RFS and 
OS after hepatectomy for solitary HCC. Enhanced surveillance for recurrence and 
potentially adjuvant therapy may be considered for patients with MVI, especially 
individuals with more severe MVI grading (M2).

The diagnosis and monitoring of disease through the detection of circulating 
protein biomarkers is a growing field in the practice of oncology. The search 
for more effective protein biomarkers to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of 
patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a valuable area of 
study, given the aggressive and often occult nature of this malignancy. Liquid 
biopsies are attractive, as they offer a minimally invasive and cost-effective 
approach when compared to traditional biopsy methods and imaging modalities used 
for diagnosis and surveillance. Carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 is currently the 
most commonly used serum protein biomarker for the diagnosis and monitoring of 
patients with PDAC, but due to its sensitivity and specificity, its utility 
remains limited. In this review, we examine how circulating protein biomarkers 
are used in the diagnosis, prognostication, and surveillance of PDAC. We also 
highlight protein biomarkers that are currently under investigation that have 
the potential to enhance our ability to detect early-stage malignancies, predict 
response to therapy, and monitor for recurrence, but these markers require 
larger prospective validation studies before they can be widely implemented. 
Continued efforts to identify and validate novel biomarkers will be crucial for 
improving the management and outcomes of patients with this challenging disease.

BACKGROUND: We aim to investigate the prevalence, patterns, risk factors, and 
outcomes of peritoneal metastases (PM) after curative laparoscopic hepatectomy 
(LH) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
METHODS: A multicenter cohort of 2,138 HCC patients who underwent curative LH 
from August 2010 to December 2016 from seven hospitals in China was 
retrospectively analyzed. The incidence of PM following LH was evaluated and 
compared with that in open hepatectomy (OH) after 1:1 propensity score matching 
(PSM).
RESULTS: PM prevalence was 5.1% (15/295) in the early period [2010-2013], 2.6% 
(47/1,843) in the later period [2014-2016], and 2.9% (62/2,138) in all LH 
patients, which was similar to 4.0% (59/1,490) in the OH patients. The 
recurrence patterns, timing, and treatment did not significantly vary between 
the LH and OH patients (P>0.05). Multivariate logistic regression revealed that 
tumor diameter >5 cm, non-anatomical resection, presence of microvascular 
invasion, and lesions <2 cm from major blood vessels were independent risk 
factors of PM after LH. Of the 62 cases with PM, 26 (41.9%) had PM only, 34 
(54.9%) had intrahepatic recurrence (IHR) and PM, and 2 (3.2%) had synchronous 
extraperitoneal metastases (EPM). Patients with resectable PM had a 5-year 
overall survival (OS) of 65.0% compared to 9.0% for unresectable PM (P=0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence, patterns and independent risk factors of PM were 
identified for HCC patients after LH. LH was not associated with increased 
incidence of PM in HCC patients for experienced surgeons. Surgical re-excision 
of PM was associated with prolonged survival.

While common pancreatic diseases, such as acute pancreatitis (AP), chronic 
pancreatitis (CP), and pancreatic cancer (PC), may greatly impact the normal 
pancreatic physiology and contribute to malnutrition, the adequate nutritional 
approach when those conditions are present significantly influences patients' 
prognosis. In patients with AP, the goals of nutritional care are to prevent 
malnutrition, correct a negative nitrogen balance, reduce inflammation, and 
improve outcomes such as local and systemic complications and mortality. 
Malnutrition in patients with CP is common but often a late manifestation of the 
disease, leading to decreased functional capacity and quality of life and 
increased risk of developing significant osteopathy, postoperative 
complications, hospitalization, and mortality. Cancer-related malnutrition is 
common in patients with PC, and it is now well recognized that early nutritional 
support can favorably impact survival, not only by increasing tolerance and 
response to disease treatments but also by improving quality of life and 
decreasing postoperative complications. The aim of this review was to emphasize 
the role of nutrition and to propose a systematic nutritional approach in 
patients with AP, CP, and PC.

Publisher: Se por um lado, doenças pancreáticas comuns, tais como pancreatite 
aguda (PA), pancreatite crónica (PC) e cancro pancreático (CP), podem ter um 
grande impacto na normal fisiologia pancreática e contribuir para desnutrição, 
por outro lado, uma abordagem nutricional adequada nos doentes com essas 
patologias pode influenciar significativamente o seu prognóstico. Em doentes com 
PA, os objetivos do suporte nutricional são a prevenção da desnutrição, a 
correção de um balanço negativo de nitrogénio, a redução da inflamação, e a 
evicção de outcomes desfavoráveis, como desenvolvimento de complicações locais 
ou sistémicas ou morte. A desnutrição é comum em doentes com PC, sendo 
frequentemente uma manifestação tardia da doença, da qual resulta uma diminuição 
da capacidade funcional e da qualidade de vida, bem como um aumento 
significativo do risco de doença óssea, complicações pós-operatórias, 
hospitalizações e morte. A desnutrição associada ao CP é também habitual e é 
atualmente reconhecido que um suporte nutricional precoce pode influenciar 
favoravelmente a sobrevida, não só por aumentar a tolerância e resposta aos 
tratamentos, mas também por melhorar a qualidade de vida e diminuir as 
complicações pós-operatórias. O objetivo da presente revisão é salientar o papel 
da nutrição e propor uma abordagem nutricional sistematizada nos doentes com PA, 
PC e CP.

Ascites and pleural effusion are recognized complications of pancreatic cancer. 
These diseases are accompanied by ascites and pleural effusion, and drug 
treatment is limited by high costs, long hospital stays, and failure rates. 
Immunotherapy may offer new option, but in most patients with late stages of 
cancer, immune cells may lose the ability to recognize tumor cells, how to 
activate their immune cells is a major problem, sodium glucosidate (SSG) is 
injected into ascites as a protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor to wake up 
immune cells and prepare for immunotherapy. We used single-cell RNA sequencing 
(scRNA-seq) to investigate whether and how SSG injected into ascites of 
pancreatic cancer elicits an immune response. Our study showed that the process 
of SSG fusion treatment of ascites and pleural effusion, the interaction between 
TandNK cells, MPs cells, monocytes and neutrophils was induced, and large 
numbers of genes were expressed, resulting in upregulation of immune response, 
which also approved that SSG is not only used as a protein tyrosine phosphatase 
inhibitor, but also it works as a protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor. It can 
also be used to regulate immune cell function, recruiting immune cells to the 
right place with the help of PD-1 or PD-L1 to fight cancer cells in ascites and 
pleural effusions in cancer patients.

Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal neoplasms worldwide; it is 
aggressive in nature and has a poor prognosis. The overall survival rate for 
pancreatic cancer is low. Most patients present non-specific symptoms in the 
advanced stages, which generally leads to late diagnosis, at which point there 
is no option for curative surgery. The treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer 
includes systemic therapy, in some cases radiotherapy, and more recently, 
molecular targeted therapies, which can positively impact cancer control and 
improve quality of life. This review provides an overview of the molecular 
landscape of pancreatic cancer based on the most recent literature, as well as 
current treatment options for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

Pancreatic cancer is the seventh leading cause of cancer death worldwide, which 
is demonstrated with remarkable resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The 
identification of prognosis signature and novel prognostic markers will 
facilitate patient stratification and an individualized precision therapy 
strategy. In this study, TCGA-PAAD was used to screen prognostic E3 ubiquitin 
ligases and establish prognostic signatures, and GEO database was used to verify 
the accuracy of prognostic signatures. Functional analysis, in vitro experiments 
and clinical cohort studies were used to analyze the function and prognostic 
efficacy of the target gene. An E3 ligase-based signature of 9 genes and the 
nomogram were developed, and the signature was proved to accurately predict the 
prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer. WDR37 might be the most prognostic 
E3 ubiquitin ligase in pancreatic cancer, and the clinical cohort analyses 
suggested a tumor-suppressive role. The results of functional analysis and in 
vitro experiments indicated that WDR37 may promote the degradation of TCP1 
complex to inhibit tumor and improve immune cell infiltration. The E3 
ligase-based signature accurately predicted the prognosis of patients with 
pancreatic cancer, so it can be used as a decision-making tool to guide the 
treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer. At the same time, WDR37, the main 
gene in E3PMP signature, can be used as the most prognostic E3 ubiquitin ligase 
in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.

As medical insurance coverage for robotic surgery has been expanded in the field 
of gastrointestinal surgery in Japan, the number of cases undergoing robotic 
surgery for hepato-biliary-pancreatic disease has been increasing. Therefore, 
cases with malignant tumors and metastatic lesions tend to undergo robotic 
operation for both primary tumors and metastases. Herein, we report a case of 
neuroendocrine tumor(NET)in the pancreatic tail with simultaneous single liver 
metastasis, which was treated with two-stage robotic-assisted surgery. A 
67-year-old female underwent a computed tomography scan and a hypovascularized 
tumor in the pancreatic tail region and liver was found. A biopsy of the 
pancreatic tumor by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration 
demonstrated a NET G1-2. The liver lesion was diagnosed as a metastatic tumor, 
considering the other examinations. The patient underwent a robotic distal 
pancreatectomy(RDP)and was histopathologically diagnosed as NET G2. Sixty-three 
days after the RDP, a two-stage partial liver resection for the metastatic tumor 
was performed under robotic assistance. Curative resection was achieved through 
two-stage robot-assisted surgery, there were no postoperative complications.

A 73-year-old, male patient presented with the chief complaint of epigastric 
pain and received the diagnosis of extensive cholangiocarcinoma after a close 
examination. Extensive extension of the malignancy into the right and left 
hepatic ducts precluded a curative resection, and the patient received GC 
therapy. After 11 courses of GC over about 1 year, no new lesions or tumor 
progression was observed, and a bile duct mapping biopsy was performed to 
investigate the possibility of resection conversion. The results showed a marked 
decrease in atypia, and reactive atypia was diagnosed. A pancreaticoduodenectomy 
was performed, and histopathologically negative margins were obtained. The 
response to treatment was Grade Ⅱa according to the Evans classification. At 23 
months after the start of treatment and 12 months after surgery, the patient is 
recurrence-free without adjuvant chemotherapy. Although the evidence for 
conversion surgery for biliary tract cancer has not been established, the 
long-term outcomes may be favorable.

A 72-year-old woman presented with obstructive jaundice. Computed tomography 
revealed a 12-mm low-density mass in the head of the pancreas. She was diagnosed 
as having pancreatic cancer by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle 
aspiration. She received gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel as preoperative 
chemotherapy. After 2 courses, hepatoduodenal lymph node metastasis appeared and 
was accompanied by increased tumor marker levels. The regimen was changed to 
modified FOLFIRINOX. After 5 courses, the lymph node metastasis was reduced in 
size and the tumor marker levels were decreased, so subtotal stomach-preserving 
pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed. Adjuvant chemotherapy was administered 
postoperatively. The patient was alive and well without recurrence 2 years and 9 
months after the surgery, but died of sepsis. Nevertheless, this case highlights 
that when preoperative chemotherapy for resectable pancreatic cancer appears to 
be ineffective, a change in regimen may be useful.

A man in his 80s was referred to our hospital for further examination of partial 
pancreatic atrophy that was detected incidentally. Various imaging examinations 
including CT, MRI, and EUS did not reveal any obvious abnormal findings other 
than the partial pancreatic atrophy. However, cytological examination of serial 
pancreatic juice aspiration showed atypical cells. The presence of pancreatic 
intraepithelial carcinoma in the atrophy site was considered, and the patient 
underwent laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy. Pathological examination of the 
excised specimen confirmed the presence of high-grade pancreatic intraepithelial 
neoplasia consistent with the atrophy site, and the patient was diagnosed with 
pTisN0M0, Stage 0 pancreatic cancer. For the detection of early pancreatic 
cancer, it is important to be aware of partial pancreatic atrophy on imaging 
studies.

A 68-year-old man was referred to our hospital for detailed examination of the 
pancreatic tail tumor. The tumor was diagnosed as the pancreatic invasive ductal 
adenocarcinoma and the distal pancreatectomy was scheduled. During surgery, a 2 
mm white nodule was observed on the posterior wall of the stomach. 
Intraoperative frozen section showed no obvious malignant findings, suggesting 
leiomyoma or gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Distal pancreatectomy with D2 
lymphadenectomy was completed as planned. However, this nodule was later 
confirmed by permanent pathological specimen to be peritoneal dissemination of 
pancreatic cancer and final diagnosis was invasive ductal carcinoma of 
pancreatic tail, pT3, pN1a, M1 (PER), pStage Ⅳ. He received chemotherapy for 17 
months. Although liver metastasis was appeared 26 months after surgery, the 
disease is still being controlled with chemotherapy at 33 months.

Pseudomyxoma peritonei(PMP)is a rare condition caused by intraductal papillary 
mucinous neoplasm(IPMN). At our institution, 3 cases, along with literature 
review, of PMP caused by IPMN were treated with cytoreductive surgery. In case 
1, a 70-year-old man was pathologically diagnosed with low-grade PMP with 
intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma. Recurrence was discovered 68 months 
after surgery, and the patient died after 78 months. In case 2, a 69-year-old 
man was pathologically diagnosed with high-grade PMP with signet-ring cell 
carcinoma caused by intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma. The patient died 8 
months post-surgery. In case 3, a 77-year-old woman was pathologically diagnosed 
with low- grade(partially high-grade)PMP with intraductal papillary mucinous 
adenoma. There was a recurrence 14 months post- surgery. The patient is still 
alive because of systemic chemotherapy 32 months after surgery.

BACKGROUND: In laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy(LPG)with esophago-gastro 
anastomosis, the key of obtaining good surgical view is how to exclude the 
stomach from the supra-pancreatic area.
METHODS: We could get good surgical view at the supra-pancreatic area with 
gastro-ptosis by firstly dissecting lesser curvature. Followed by the 
supra-pancreatic dissection we could efficiently dissect the gastro-splenic 
ligament from cranial side. We performed this procedure in 20 cases with upper 
gastric cancer. We evaluate the surgical outcomes of this procedure(S 
group)comparing to that of the previous procedure in 14 cases(G group).
RESULTS: The median operative time in S group was significantly shorter than 
that in G group (226 min vs 249 min, p=0.02). Other data were similar in 2 
groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The short-term clinical outcomes of LPG with supra-pancreatic 
dissection first approach revealed that this technique is safe and feasible.

Bulky N+ gastric cancer has a poor prognosis. The results of JCOG0405 showed the 
efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 plus cisplatin combination therapy 
for Bulky N+ gastric cancer. JLSSG0901 demonstrated the safety and efficacy of 
laparoscopic surgery for advanced gastric cancer. But the safety of laparoscopic 
surgery for locally advanced and extensive nodal metastasis cancer(T4b, 
para-aortic lymph node metastasis)is not apparent. After DOS therapy, we 
performed total laparoscopic gastrectomy, DP(distal pancreatectomy), D2+ 
#16a2/b1 lat, and Roux-en-Y reconstruction, and histopathological results showed 
that the aortic lymph node metastasis disappeared. We controlled extensive lymph 
node metastasis using preoperative triplet chemotherapy. Laparoscopic surgery 
after preoperative chemotherapy for Bulky N+ gastric cancer can be a treatment 
option because we performed laparoscopic resection and para-aortic lymph node 
dissection with no complications, including pancreatic complications.

INTRODUCTION: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine plus S-1(NAC GS)has been 
reported to prolong the prognosis of resectable pancreatic cancer, and is now 
being used in daily practice. In this study, we investigated the tolerability 
and outcome of neoadjuvant GS therapy for resectable pancreatic cancer in our 
hospital.
PATIENTS: Fifty-two patients who underwent NAC GS for resectable pancreatic 
cancer between November 2019 and March 2023 were included in this study.
RESULTS: The mean age of all 52 patients was 75 years, 28 were male and 24 were 
female. Tumor site was pancreatic head cancer in 32 patients, pancreatic body 
cancer in 13 patients, and pancreatic tail cancer in 8 patients. Only 2 patients 
of the 52 patients completed 2 cycles of GS therapy with full dose, and dose 
reduction and treatment deferral were performed in remaining 50 patients. The 
dose intensity was 78.4% for gemcitabine and 66.7% for S-1. Grade 3 or higher 
adverse events included neutropenia in 21 patients(40.4%), biliary tract 
infection in 6 patients(11.5%), fatigue, anorexia, hepatic dysfunction, and 
constipation in 1 patient each(1.9%). 47 patients(90.4%)underwent R0 resection. 
4 patients had pancreatic fistula, which was classified as Grade Ⅲ by 
Clavien-Dindo, and one of them died in the hospital due to bleeding from a 
pseudoaneurysm.
CONCLUSION: NAC GS therapy for resectable pancreatic cancer was considered 
feasible with appropriate management of adverse events.

The patient described herein was diagnosed with left breast, endometrial, and 
early gastric cancers at 49, 53, and 57 years of age, respectively. Magnetic 
resonance cholangiopancreatography performed when she was undergoing treatment 
for cholecystitis at 50 years of age showed local pancreatic duct dilatation in 
the pancreatic head. She was followed in the Department of Gastroenterology at 
our hospital for an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm(IPMN). An abdominal 
computed tomography scan obtained at 59 years of age revealed dilation of the 
main pancreatic duct in the pancreas body and tail, therefore an endoscopic 
ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration was performed. She was diagnosed with 
pancreatic cancer and underwent a laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy. The 
postoperative course was uneventful; however, the pancreatic cancer recurred and 
she died approximately 14 months postoperatively. Reports of multiple cancers 
associated with IPMNs are rare, yet we managed a patient with a pancreatic head 
IPMN complicated by metachronous quadruple carcinomas( breast, endometrial, 
gastric, and pancreatic cancers).

Serial pancreatic juice aspiration cytological examination(SPACE)has been 
reported as a reliable preoperative diagnostic method for early pancreatic 
cancer, when combined with imaging findings suspecting early pancreatic cancer. 
Among 259 patients with suspected pancreatic cancer who underwent pancreatic 
resection at our hospital, SPACE was preoperatively performed in 14 cases(5.4%). 
Of these 14 cases, final pathological diagnosis was pancreatic cancer in 12 
patients (86%), including 5 patients with Stage ⅠA pancreatic cancer(35.7%), all 
of whom had a mass on preoperative CT or EUS. On the other hand, in the other 2 
cases(14.3%), CT/EUS detected no mass but focal pancreatic parenchymal atrophy 
and main pancreatic duct stenosis which were the imaging findings suspecting 
very early pancreatic cancer such as cancer in situ. Although preoperative SPACE 
results of these 2 cases were class Ⅳ, final pathological results of resected 
specimen were low-grade PanIN in both cases. SPACE was considered useful for 
preoperative diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in our study, however further study 
is needed to examine its diagnostic accuracy for early pancreatic cancer which 
does not appear as a mass in any imaging modality.

A woman in her 70s underwent distal pancreatectomy(D2 dissection)for a 
pancreatic tail carcinoma after a close examination of the cause of her poorly 
controlled diabetes mellitus. Intraoperative rapid peritoneal washing cytology 
showed no malignant findings, but histopathological examination revealed Ptb, 
TS2, tub2, pT3, ly1, v3, ne3, mpd0, pS0, pRP1, pOO0, pPCM0, pDPM0, pN0, pM0, 
pCY1, pStage ⅡA, R0(Pancreatic Cancer Treatment Protocol 7th Edition). The 
patient was treated with S-1 therapy for 6 months postoperatively and is alive 1 
year and 9 months without recurrence. The prognosis after resection of 
pancreatic cancer with positive peritoneal washing cytology is said to be worse 
than that of patients with negative, because of the high recurrence rate of 
peritoneal metastasis. We report a case of pancreatic tail carcinoma with 
positive peritoneal washing cytology with recurrence-free survival after surgery 
and chemotherapy.

In laparoscopic surgery, intraabdominal examination is occasionally difficult 
due to restriction of operative field and palpation. This is a case report of a 
jejunal ectopic pancreas which was incidentally found during laparoscopic 
surgery. A 49-year- old male underwent endoscopic mucosal resection for a rectal 
polyp which pathologically resulted in 5,000 μm invasion in submucosa and 
lymphatic invasion. Laparoscopic low anterior resection was planned for the 
patient as an additional treatment. During the surgery, irregular shaped 
tumor-like lesion was incidentally found in jejunum which was located 30 cm 
distal side from the ligament of Treitz. Partial resection of jejunum was also 
performed for pathological diagnosis. Resected jejunal lesion was pathologically 
diagnosed as an ectopic pancreas of Heinrich classification type Ⅰ. Ectopic 
pancreas is defined as pancreatic tissue which is discontinuous to pancreas, 
asymptomatic in most cases, but some reported cases of pancreatitis, forming 
fistula or cancerous change. Reporting with some literature review.

BACKGROUND: Carbon-ion radiotherapy(CIRT)has an advantage over conventional 
radiotherapy by its dose distribution and biological effect for locally advanced 
unresectable pancreatic cancer(UR-PC). Conversion surgery(CS)might be attempted 
for UR-PC with favorable response by chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 67-year-old female who have a history of distal 
gastrectomy. CT scan revealed locally advanced UR-PC with invasion to celiac 
artery, 60 mm in size. Systemic chemotherapy with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel 
was continued for 15 months, showing decrease of tumor markers and radiological 
shrinkage of the tumor. The patient was referred to our hospital for surgical 
consultation. Since there was no metastasis in staging laparoscopy, CIRT with 
gemcitabine was administered for 3 weeks. After completion of CIRT, distal 
pancreatectomy with celiac axis resection and total remnant gastrectomy for 
direct invasion of the tumor was performed as CS, resulting R0 resection. Her 
postoperative course was uneventful with 17 days of hospital stay.
DISCUSSION: CS after CIRT was safely performed. Clinical trial of total 
neoadjuvant therapy with systemic chemotherapy, CIRT, followed by CS for locally 
advanced CIRT is ongoing in our hospital. CIRT could be an effective treatment 
in locally advanced UR-PC in the context of multi-modal treatment including CS.

A 31-year-old man with a big epigastric mass from pancreas body was completely 
removed by distal pancreatectomy and segmental gastrectomy. Two years after oral 
administration of S-1 for 4 courses, peritoneal dissemination on the right 
subdiaphragmatic space was detected. Laparotomy revealed white colored round 
nodules were found scattered on the peritoneal surface, and the peritoneal 
cancer index(PCI)was 18. To achieve complete resection of peritoneal nodules, 
peritonectomy was performed. After complete removal of macroscopic peritoneal 
metastasis(PM), intraoperative hyperthermic intraoperative peritoneal 
chemotherapy using 1 gr of gemcitabine and 60 mg of docetaxel was performed for 
40 min with thermal dose of 41.5 min. Postoperative course was uneventful. Drug 
sensitivity test(HDRA method)showed that gemcitabine that gemcitabine showed the 
highest inhibition rate. The patient was treated with systemic gemcitabine 
chemotherapy. He is still alive without recurrence 18 months after peritonectomy 
plus intraoperative HIPEC. Pathological examination showed pancreatic acinar 
cell carcinoma(PACC)demonstrating positive for chymotrypsin. In conclusion, we 
present a PACC-case with PM successfully treated by a comprehensive treatment. 
Intraoperative HIPEC using gemcitabine may be effective for PACC patients with 
PM in treating residual micrometastasis after peritonectomy.

A 52-year-old woman underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy after an abnormal 
medical examination, which revealed a mass lesion over half the circumference of 
the superior duodenal angulus. Immunostaining was diffusely positive for 
somatostatin, synaptophysin, and chromogranin A. A 3 cm-sized mass in the 
pancreaticoduodenal region and multiple nodular lesions of a few mm in both 
lobes of the liver were revealed by CT. The diagnosis is primary 
somatostatin-producing tumor of the duodenum with multiple liver metastases. She 
underwent gastric jejunal bypass for impaired transit. Afterwards hepatic 
infusion and systemic chemotherapy were continued, and 5 years passed without 
progression. When she stopped chemotherapy for 6 months, she started 
somatostatin analogue therapy because of the increase of the tumors. The tumors 
did not increase, and 20 years have passed since the start of treatment. We 
report a case of primary somatostatin-producing tumor of the duodenum with liver 
metastases that is still alive for a long period of time, with a review of the 
literature.

A 58-year-old woman presented with a complaint of weight loss. Abdominal 
computed tomography showed dilatation of the biliary and pancreatic ducts and a 
mural nodule in the pancreatic duct. The diagnosis was intraductal papillary 
mucinous neoplasm(IPMN). Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography(ERCP)and 
cholangioscopy revealed a fistula between the common bile duct and the IPMN. A 
sudden increase in hepatobiliary enzymes was noted preoperatively. ERCP showed 
that the common bile duct was obstructed by mucus. A nasobiliary drainage tube 
was inserted into the bile duct endoscopically and kept open by daily tube 
washing, and the liver dysfunction improved. Total pancreatectomy, splenectomy, 
and regional lymph node dissection were performed. Histological examination 
confirmed that the primary tumor was mixed invasive intraductal papillary 
mucinous adenocarcinoma. The patient remains alive and well with no evidence of 
recurrence 18 months after resection.

The case was a 70-year-old man of highly advanced gastric cancer with 2 liver 
metastases(S3, S8)and pancreatic invasion. Three courses of S-1 plus L-OHP(SOX 
therapy)were performed, and total gastrectomy and combined resection of the 
spleen and body and tail of the pancreas and partial resection of the liver S3 
and S8 were performed after reduction of primary tumor and liver metastasis. S-1 
therapy was continued for 1 year as postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. Left 
adrenal metastasis was detected by CT, 1 year and 6 months after the operation. 
PET-CT revealed no other areas suspected of recurrence, so left adrenalectomy 
was performed through the retroperitoneal space. Radical resection was not 
achieved because adhesions and scarring from the previous surgery were severe. 
Paclitaxel plus Ramucirumab was started and after 10 courses, the disappearance 
of the tumor shadow was observed on enhanced CT, and PET-CT. Three years and 3 
months after the initial surgery and 1 year and 8 months after resection of 
adrenal metastasis, the patient is alive without recurrence.

BACKGROUND: Although pancreatoduodenectomy is recommended as a radical surgery 
for duodenal carcinoma, it has been reported that pancreatoduodenectomy in 
elderly patients has a high risk of surgical complications.
CASE PRESENTATION: A man in his 80's was diagnosed with advanced duodenal 
carcinoma, presenting with anemia(Hb 5.4 g/dL). Computed tomography scanning 
showed wall thickening in the descending leg of the duodenum, pancreatic 
invasion was suspected, and clinical diagnosis was Stage ⅡB(cT4N0M0). Although 
radical surgery was possible, the patient refused surgery considering the risks 
of surgical complications. The gastroduodenal bypass surgery was performed to 
control bleeding, and the patient was treated with S-1 plus oxaliplatin(SOX; S-1 
100 mg/body, days 1-14; oxaliplatin 100 mg/m2, day 1 q21 days). After 6 courses 
of the SOX regimen, the wall thickening of duodenum disappeared, and SOX was 
switched to S-1 monotherapy (S-1 100 mg/body, days 1-28, q42 days)according to 
Grade 2 thrombocytopenia and decreased performance status. After 11 courses of 
S-1, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed that the tumor had disappeared, the 
biopsy of duodenum showed no evidence of malignancy, and chemotherapy was 
terminated. The patient has been followed up for 7 months without recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: SOX for elderly patient showed efficacy against hemorrhagic 
duodenal carcinoma.

A 73-year-old woman underwent left nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma(RCC). 
The computed tomography(CT)and magnetic resonance imaging(MRI)revealed a 20-mm 
tumor in the pancreatic tale showing early enhancement in the arterial phase 16 
years after surgery. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission 
tomography(FDG-PET)showed slightly uptake (maximum standard uptake value: SUVmax 
2.3)and EUS-FNA showed a hyper-vascularized tumor in the pancreatic tail. A 
single pancreatic metastasis from RCC was diagnosed, and we performed distal 
pancreatectomy. The histopathological diagnosis was a metastatic pancreatic 
tumor from RCC. The postoperative course was uneventful and 1 month after 
surgery, she is alive with no recurrence.

SUBJECTS: We first reviewed surgical outcomes and pathological findings of 32 
patients(laparoscopic group: LDP n=11, open group: ODP n=21)who underwent distal 
pancreatectomy for pancreatic cancer from January 2018 to October 2022. Then we 
reviewed long-term outcomes, and recurrence type for 20 patients(LDP: n=5, ODP: 
n=15)from January 2018 to February 2021.
RESULTS: LDP group had significantly longer operation time and less blood loss. 
There was no difference in length of hospital stay, postoperative complications, 
number of dissected lymph nodes, positive lymph node metastasis rate, and 
adjuvant chemotherapy rate. Because of high rate of pancreatic stump closure by 
hand sewing in ODP, postoperative pancreatic fistula rate was higher in ODP than 
in LDP. The 2-year relapse-free survival rate was 60% in LDP, 33% in ODP, and 
the 2-year overall survival rate was 60% in LDP, 71% in ODP, and there were no 
significant differences. As for the type of recurrence, in LDP group, 2 cases of 
distant metastases and no local recurrence was observed, and in ODP group, 6 
cases each of local recurrences and distant metastases were observed.
CONCLUSION: LDP was not inferior to ODP in short and long- term outcomes, 
safety, curability, and local control ability.

A 69-year-old man with dysphagia was diagnosed with advanced esophageal cancer 
by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. He had undergone pancreatic tail and 
partial transverse colon resection for pancreatic cancer, and right hilar lymph 
node biopsy and partial lower lobe resection for the diagnosis of pulmonary 
sarcoidosis. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography(CT)scan showed no change over 
time in lymph node enlargement in the mediastinum, so metastasis of esophageal 
cancer was considered to be negative. Therefore, the diagnosis of advanced 
esophageal cancer, Mt, type 2, T2N0M0, cStage Ⅱ, was made, and surgery was 
performed after 2 courses of DCF therapy. Because of the adhesions in the 
thoracic cavity and possible problems with elevation of the gastric tube and 
blood flow due to resection of the pancreatic tail, it was decided to perform 
two-stage operation. Although imaging studies over time, as in the present case, 
can help in the diagnosis, it is difficult to distinguish whether enlarged lymph 
nodes are reactive changes or metastases. In this study, we experienced a case 
of thoracic esophageal cancer complicated by sarcoidosis with enlarged 
mediastinal lymph nodes.

INTRODUCTION: Laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy(LPD)has been covered by 
insurance since 2016 in Japan. Advance LPD and robotic 
pancreaticoduodenectomy(RPD)has been also covered by insurance since 2020 in 
Japan. The aim of this study was to analyze the perioperative results and 
outcomes of RPD and LPD for the elderly patients and to compare to the 
non-elderly patients.
PATIENTS AND METHOD: Between July 2020 and April 2023, 67 patients underwent RPD 
and between May 2012 and February 2021, 63 patients underwent LPD at Kansai 
Rosai Hospital. Sixty-seven RPD and 62 LPD patients without extended resection 
were divided into 2 groups those who were over 75 years old(R/LPD E)(n=55)and 
under 74 years old(R/LPD non-E)(n=74). Control patients who received open 
pancreaticoduodenectomy(OPD)without extended resection between April 2010 and 
April 2023 were also divided into 2 groups those who were over 75 years old(OPD 
E)(n =60)and under 74 years old(OPD non-E)(n=78). The patient age was 79.0 and 
60.5 years, the male to female ratio was 35/20 and 45/29, disease ratio(invasive 
ductal carcinoma or not)was 7/48 and 9/65 in R/LPD E and R/LPD non-E groups, 
respectively. The patient age was 79.0 and 79.5 years, the male to female ratio 
was 35/20 and 31/29, disease ratio (invasive ductal carcinoma or not)was 7/48 
and 30/30(p<0.0001)in R/LPD E and OPD E groups, respectively. This study was 
approved by the Human Ethics Review Committee of Kansai Rosai 
Hospital(Certificate Number: 2001019).
RESULTS: The average operation time was 644.6 and 675.2 minutes, an estimated 
blood loss was 220.8 and 134.4 g, postoperative pancreatic fistula(ISGPS 2016, 
[-]/BL/Grade B/C)was 24/18/13/0 and 28/25/21/0, delayed gastric emptying(ISGPS 
2007, [-]/Grade A/B/C)was 48/0/4/3 and 61/2/6/5 and postoperative hospital stay 
was 27.9 and 25.9 and in R/LPD E and R/LPD non-E groups, respectively. No 
significant differences were noted between the groups, However, postoperative 
complication over Ⅲa Clavien-Dindo classification was 8(15.7%)and 
3(4.4%)cases(p=0.0319)in R/LPD E and R/ LPD non-E groups. The average operation 
time was 644.6 and 492.1 minutes(p<0.0001), an estimated blood loss was 220.8 
and 534.8 g(p=0.0004), postoperative pancreatic fistula(ISGPS 2016, [-]/BL/Grade 
B/C)was 24/18/13/0 and 27/8/24/1(p=0.0442), postoperative hospital stay was 27.9 
and 42.0(p=0.0490)in R/LPD E and OPD E groups, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The R/LPD was undergone in safety, even for the over 75 years old 
patients.

A case is a female of 61-year-old. She visited her local doctor with a chief 
complaint of frequent burping. She was hospitalized for gastric cancer with 
pyloric stenosis. Although open gastrectomy was planned the gastric cancer was 
unresectable due to pancreatic invasion and peritoneal dissemination. Cytology 
with abdominal lavage was CY0. She underwent gastrojejunostomy. She was treated 
by 19 courses of chemotherapy with SOX therapy for 2 years. The tumor reduced, 
and she underwent distal gastrectomy as conversion surgery. Pathological 
findings were por2>muc>tub2>tub1, ypT2(ypMP), INF c, int, Ly1a, V0, pPM0, pDM0, 
pN0(0/43), ypStage ⅠB, R0, Grade 2b. Adjuvant chemotherapy(S-1 and docetaxel)was 
administered after conversion surgery. She is alive without recurrence for 1 
year and 6 months after gastrectomy. We report a case of Stage Ⅳ gastric cancer 
treated with conversion surgery after chemotherapy.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest 
cancers, with a five-year survival rate of approximately 5%. The incidence and 
mortality rates of PDAC are increasing, and the results of medical treatments 
remain unsatisfactory. Some conflicting evidence suggests that aspirin intake 
may reduce the risk of PDAC. This study aimed to evaluate the association 
between regular low-dose aspirin use (80-mg aspirin tablets, 5-7 tablets/week) 
and the risk of PDAC.
METHODS: This prospective, hospital-based, case-control study was performed on 
470 PDAC patients (case group) and 526 sex and age-matched controls, in Tehran, 
Iran from 2011 to 2018. The participants were interviewed regarding the patterns 
of aspirin use. Data are expressed as mean±SD or frequency and percentage as 
appropriate. Differences in frequency between the case and control groups were 
evaluated based on the analysis of the contingency table (χ2 test and Fisher's 
exact test). Propensity score models were designed to calculate odds ratios (OR) 
and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for PDAC with respect to aspirin use, 
adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, opium use, diabetes mellitus, place of 
residence, and family history of cancer in first-degree relatives.
RESULTS: About 60% of PDAC patients were male in this study. Also, 25.2% of PDAC 
patients had a family history of cancer in one of their first-degree relatives, 
21.99% were smokers, 13.9% were opium users, and 11.7% had a history of 
diabetes. Aspirin was used by 22.77% of PDAC patients and 18.25% of the 
controls. Ever aspirin use (OR: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.89 - 1.14) was not associated 
with PDAC.
CONCLUSION: Overall, aspirin use was not associated with a reduced risk of PDAC.

Republic - current status and possible implementations.

[Article in English]

INTRODUCTION: Minimally-invasive surgical methods have been becoming ever more 
common also in the segment of pancreatic surgery. The aim of this paper was to 
analyze the current state of minimally-invasive surgery in the Czech Republic 
and the justification and potential of implementing such procedures.
METHODS: Analysis of high volume centers using healthcare providers´ and payers´ 
data.
RESULTS: Thirteen pancreatic surgical centers meet the proposed criteria for 
being called a high volume center - a center of highly specialized care in 
pancreatic surgery based on the annual number of at least 17 major resections of 
the pancreas. According to data from healthcare payers, laparoscopy was used in 
0.6%-65.7% of procedures in individual centers. However, these are not resection 
procedures. The centers themselves report a significantly smaller number of 
minimally-invasive pancreatic resection procedures. The actual numbers of 
minimally-invasive resection procedures in the current system are practically 
impossible to verify. The potential for implementing minimally-invasive 
pancreatic surgery in the Czech Republic can be estimated based on the 
identification of candidate patients.
CONCLUSION: Due to the fragmentation of this operative segment, its costs and 
small numbers of patients suitable for minimally-invasive pancreatic surgery 
even among high volume centers, the implementation rate of these methods is very 
slow. The need to centralize this segment of care appears to be very urgent from 
all points of view.

AIMS: Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly metastatic malignant tumor of the 
digestive system. Drug resistance frequently occurs during cancer treatment 
process. This study aimed to explore the link between chemoresistance and tumor 
metastasis in PC and its possible molecular and cellular mechanisms.
METHODS: A Metastasis and Chemoresistance Signature (MCS) scoring system was 
built and validated based on metastasis- and chemoresistance-related genes using 
gene expression data of PC, and the model was applied to single-cell RNA 
sequencing data. The influence of linker histone H1.2 (H1-2) on PC was explored 
through in vitro and in vivo experiments including proliferation, invasion, 
migration, drug sensitivity, rescue experiments and immunohistochemistry, 
emphasizing its regulation with c-MYC signaling pathway.
RESULTS: A novel MCS scoring system accurately predicted PC patient survival and 
was linked to chemoresistance and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in PC 
single-cell RNA sequencing data. H1-2 emerged as a significant prognostic 
factor, with its high expression indicating increased chemoresistance and EMT. 
This upregulation was mediated by c-MYC, which was also found to be highly 
expressed in PC tissues.
CONCLUSION: The MCS scoring system offers insights into PC chemoresistance and 
metastasis potential. Targeting H1-2 could enhance therapeutic strategies and 
improve PC patient outcomes.

Herein, we report a case of pancreatic cancer with acute cholangitis secondary 
to biliary obstruction. Empirical antibiotic therapy did not change the clinical 
presentation. Blood cultures were sterile; however, bile culture was positive 
for yeasts. Our laboratory analysis revealed a biliary coinfection by 
multidrug-resistant C. glabrata and C. albicans. The patient was successfully 
treated with endoscopic biliary drainage.

It was to explore the detection efficiency of novel nano microfluidic chips on 
circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in pancreatic cancer (PC) patients and the effect 
of comprehensive nursing intervention on the life indicators of patients after 
PC surgery. PC, benign pancreas, and healthy volunteers were enrolled. The 
number and positive rate of CTCs in the subjects, the relationship between the 
number of CTCs in PC patients and clinical data, the recurrence rate, and the 
life indicators of patients after intervention were sorted out and analyzed. The 
positive rate of CTCs was 96.67% in PC group (29/30), 16.67% in benign pancreas 
group (5/30), and 0% in healthy controls. The positive CTCs in PC patients were 
correlated with vascular invasion (P<0.05). The recurrence rate after PC 
resection was 56.67% (17/30). The positive detection rate of nano microfluidic 
chip was 30/30 (100%), which was higher than against CellSeach 7/30 (23.33%), 
P<0.05. The physiological function score of intervention group (93.67±1.48) was 
higher as against controls (60.45±2.03), P<0.05. The social function score of 
intervention group (91.26±0.44) was higher as against controls (54.92±2.98), 
P<0.05. The novel nano microfluidic chip has high sensitivity and specificity 
for the detection of CTCs in PC patients. Postoperative comprehensive nursing 
intervention can improve the quality of life (QoL) and functional status of PC 
patients.

Longitudinal studies have indicated the facilitating effect of RGC-32 during 
diverse disease progression including pancreatic cancer, yet the systematic and 
detailed effect of RGC-32 during pancreatic cancer is largely unknowable. For 
this purpose, we took advantage of the pancreatic cancer cell line (BXPC3) with 
RGC-32 expression and then modulated its expression by lentivirus-mediated 
knockdown (shRGC-32) and overexpression (pcDNA-RGC-32). To verify the effect of 
Wnt/β-catenin signaling in RGC-32-based tumorigenicity, we added the agonist 
CT99021 to the shRGC-32 BXPC3 cell line and pancreatic cancer mouse model. The 
deficiency in cellular vitality (cell survival, apoptosis, cell cycle) and 
migration of BXPC3 were sharply rescued by shRGC-32 in vitro. Notably, the 
aforementioned phenotypes as well as the expression pattern of EMT-associated 
biomarkers of BXPC3 with shRGC-32 expression could largely rescued by the 
agonist of Wnt/β-catenin in vitro and in vivo. Our data indicated the 
facilitating effect of RGC-32 upon pancreatic cancer cell line and mouse model 
via activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which collectively suggested the 
feasibility of RGC-32 as a potent diagnostic and therapeutic target of 
pancreatic cancer in the future.

A new prenylated indole diketopiperazine alkaloid, rubrumline P (1), was 
isolated along with six more analogues and characterized from the fermentation 
culture of a marine sediment-derived fungus, Aspergillus chevalieri, collected 
at a depth of 15 m near the lighthouse in Dahab, Red Sea, Egypt. In the current 
study, a bioassay-guided fractionation allowed for the identification of an 
active fraction displaying significant cytotoxic activity against the human 
pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line PANC-1 from the EtOAc extract of the 
investigated fungus compared to the standard paclitaxel. The structures of the 
isolated compounds from the active fraction were established using 1D/2D NMR 
spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, together with comparisons with the 
literature. The absolute configuration of the obtained indole diketopiperazines 
was established based on single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses of rubrumline 
I (2) and comparisons of optical rotations and NMR data, as well as on 
biogenetic considerations. Genome sequencing indicated the formation of 
prenyltransferases, which was subsequently confirmed by the isolation of mono-, 
di-, tri-, and tetraprenylated compounds. Compounds rubrumline P (1) and 
neoechinulin D (4) confirmed preferential cytotoxic activity against PANC-1 
cancer cells with IC50 values of 25.8 and 23.4 µM, respectively. Although the 
underlying mechanism-of-action remains elusive in this study, cell cycle 
analysis indicated a slight increase in the sub-G1 peak after treatment with 
compounds 1 and 4.

Although the relationship between psychological factors and pancreatic cancer 
outcomes has been widely discussed, controversy remains. We will for the first 
time systematically summarize the literature to explore the correlation of 
anxiety and depression to the prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer. The 
findings will fill existing research gaps, informing healthcare providers about 
better psychological care and medical treatment. The following databases will be 
retrieved from their inception to July 2023: Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (PubMed), 
Web of Science, EMBASE, and four Chinese databases (Chinese National Knowledge 
Infrastructure, Wanfang Database, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and 
Chongqing VIP Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database). The World 
Health Organization Clinical Trials Registry, Chinese Clinical Registry, and 
ClinicalTrials.gov will be searched to identify other related studies. A manual 
search will be performed to identify missing eligible studies based on the 
reference list of selected articles. The search will focus on studies published 
in Chinese or English. To assess the risk of bias in the selected articles, 
Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) will be used for the cohort 
study. Funnel plots and Egger's test will be used to assess whether publication 
bias exists. Moreover, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and 
Evaluation (GRADE) will be utilized to analyze the credibility of the results 
from selected articles. Two independent evaluators will implement the study 
selection and data extraction, as well as evaluate the risk of bias and evidence 
quality. Data will be analyzed using Stata 16.0. Trial registration: PROSPERO 
registration number is CRD42022366232.

Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm (IPMN) cysts are pre-malignant pancreas 
lesions, and they can progress into pancreatic cancer. Therefore, detecting and 
stratifying their risk level is of ultimate importance for effective treatment 
planning and disease control. However, this is a highly challenging task because 
of the diverse and irregular shape, texture, and size of the IPMN cysts as well 
as the pancreas. In this study, we propose a novel computer-aided diagnosis 
pipeline for IPMN risk classification from multi-contrast MRI scans. Our 
proposed analysis framework includes an efficient volumetric self-adapting 
segmentation strategy for pancreas delineation, followed by a newly designed 
deep learning-based classification scheme with a radiomics-based predictive 
approach. We test our proposed decision-fusion model in multi-center data sets 
of 246 multi-contrast MRI scans and obtain superior performance to the state of 
the art (SOTA) in this field. Our ablation studies demonstrate the significance 
of both radiomics and deep learning modules for achieving the new SOTA 
performance compared to international guidelines and published studies (81.9% vs 
61.3% in accuracy). Our findings have important implications for clinical 
decision-making. In a series of rigorous experiments on multi-center data sets 
(246 MRI scans from five centers), we achieved unprecedented performance (81.9% 
accuracy). The code is available upon publication.

The importance of cancer-associated fibroblasts in targeted therapies and drug 
resistance in breast cancer.

University, Shanghai, China.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a substantial role in the tumor 
microenvironment, exhibiting a strong association with the advancement of 
various types of cancer, including breast, pancreatic, and prostate cancer. CAFs 
represent the most abundant mesenchymal cell population in breast cancer. 
Through diverse mechanisms, including the release of cytokines and exosomes, 
CAFs contribute to the progression of breast cancer by influencing tumor energy 
metabolism, promoting angiogenesis, impairing immune cell function, and 
remodeling the extracellular matrix. Moreover, CAFs considerably impact the 
response to treatment in breast cancer. Consequently, the development of 
interventions targeting CAFs has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach in 
the management of breast cancer. This article provides an analysis of the role 
of CAFs in breast cancer, specifically in relation to diagnosis, treatment, drug 
resistance, and prognosis. The paper succinctly outlines the diverse mechanisms 
through which CAFs contribute to the malignant behavior of breast cancer cells, 
including proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance. Furthermore, 
the article emphasizes the potential of CAFs as valuable tools for early 
diagnosis, targeted therapy, treatment resistance, and prognosis assessment in 
breast cancer, thereby offering novel approaches for targeted therapy and 
overcoming treatment resistance in this disease.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: The effectiveness of adjuvant immunotherapy to diminish 
recurrence and improve long-term prognosis following curative-intent surgical 
resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is of increased interest, 
especially among individuals at high risk of recurrence. The objective of the 
current study was to investigate the impact of adjuvant immunotherapy on 
long-term recurrence and survival after curative resection among patients with 
intermediate/advanced HCC.
METHODS: Using a prospectively-collected multicenter database, patients who 
underwent curative-intent resection for Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) 
stage B/C HCC were identified. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was used 
to compare recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) between 
patients treated with and without adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). 
Multivariate Cox-regression analysis further identified independent factors of 
RFS and OS.
RESULTS: Among the 627 enrolled patients, 109 patients (23.3%) received adjuvant 
immunotherapy. Most ICI-related adverse reactions were grading I-II. PSM 
analysis created 99 matched pairs of patients with comparable baseline 
characteristics between patients treated with and without adjuvant 
immunotherapy. In the PSM cohort, the median RFS (29.6 vs. 19.3 months, P=0.031) 
and OS (35.1 vs. 27.8 months, P=0.036) were better among patients who received 
adjuvant immunotherapy versus patients who did not. After adjustment for other 
confounding factors on multivariable analyzes, adjuvant immunotherapy remained 
independently associated with favorable RFS (HR: 0.630; 95% CI: 0.435-0.914; 
P=0.015) and OS (HR: 0.601; 95% CI: 0.401-0.898; P=0.013). Subgroup analyzes 
identified potentially prognostic benefits of adjuvant immunotherapy among 
patients with intermediate-stage and advanced-stage HCC.
CONCLUSION: This real-world observational study demonstrated that adjuvant 
immunotherapy was associated with improved RFS and OS following curative-intent 
resection of intermediate/advanced HCC. Future randomized controlled trials are 
warranted to establish definitive evidence for this specific population at high 
risks of recurrence.

BACKGROUND: The DIAPHs (DIAPH1, DIAPH2, and DIAPH3) are members of the 
diaphanous subfamily of the formin family. KIF20B and MET, hub genes of DIAPHs, 
play crucial roles in cytoskeletal remodeling, cell migration, and adhesion. 
However, their combined prognostic and treatment value in pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma (PC) warrants further investigation.
METHODS: Multiomics analysis tools were used to comprehensively assess the 
genomic expression and prognostic value of KIF20B and MET in PC. Immune cell 
infiltration, functional enrichment, single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA) analysis, 
potential therapeutic drugs, and nomograms were established and analyzed. CCK-8 
levels, transwell assay, Co-IP assay, mass spectrometry, and western blotting 
were performed to assess the role of KIF20B and MET as modulators of β-catenin 
and Lactate Dehydrogenase A (LDHA) in vitro. Xenograft tumor models were used to 
evaluate the anti-tumor effects in vivo.
RESULTS: DIAPHs, KIF20B, and MET were overexpressed and functioned as poor 
prognostic markers of PC. Immunoinfiltration analysis revealed that pDC and NK 
cells were enriched with low expression levels of KIF20B and MET, whereas Th2 
cells were enriched with high expression levels of these two genes. The copy 
number variations (CNVs) in KIF20B and MET were positively correlated with B 
cell and CD4 + T cell infiltration. Immunological checkpoints NT5E and CD44 were 
positively correlated with KIF20B and MET expression. Moreover, the nomogram 
constructed based on KIF20B and MET demonstrated predictive value for overall 
survival. scRNA-Seq analysis indicated that KIF20B and MET were enriched in 
endothelial, malignant, B, T, and CD8 + T cells, which correlated with 
glycolysis and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The interactions of 
KIF20B and MET with β-catenin and LDHA were verified by Co-IP assay and mass 
spectrometry. Knockdown of KIF20B and MET downregulates β-catenin and LDHA in 
vitro. Furthermore, dual knockdown of KIF20B and MET exhibited a synergistic 
suppressive effect on PC progression in vitro and in vivo.
CONCLUSION: DIAPHs, KIF20B, and MET are promising candidates for the prognosis 
and treatment of PC. More importantly, downregulation of KIF20B and MET 
inhibited pancreatic cancer progression by regulating LDHA and EMT.

The best-known etiologies of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia are insulinoma, 
non-insulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycemic syndrome, autoimmune processes, and 
factitious hypoglycemia. In 2009, a disease not associated with classic genetic 
syndromes and characterized by the presence of multiple pancreatic lesions was 
described and named insulinomatosis. We present the clinical and pathologic 
features of four patients with the diagnosis of insulinomatosis, aggregated new 
clinical data, reviewed extensively the literature, and illustrated the nature 
and evolution of this recently recognized disease. One of our patients had 
isolated (without fasting hypoglycemia) postprandial hypoglycemia, an occurrence 
not previously reported in the literature. Furthermore, we reported the second 
case presenting malignant disease. All of them had persistent/recurrent 
hypoglycemia after the first surgery even with pathology confirming the presence 
of a positive insulin neuroendocrine tumor. In the literature review, 27 
sporadic insulinomatosis cases were compiled. All of them had episodes of 
fasting hypoglycemia except one of our patients. Only two patients had malignant 
disease, and one of them was from our series. The suspicion of insulinomatosis 
can be raised before surgery in patients without genetic syndromes, with 
multiple tumors in the topographic investigation and in those who had persistent 
or recurrent hypoglycemia after surgical removal of one or more tumors. The 
definitive diagnosis is established by histology and immunohistochemistry and 
requires examination of the "macroscopically normal pancreas." Our case series 
reinforces the marked predominance in women, the high frequency of recurrent 
hypoglycemia, and consequently, a definitive poor response to the usual surgical 
treatment.

Gemcitabine is a cytotoxic drug commonly used in the treatment of several types 
of cancer. While gemcitabine is generally considered safe and effective, it can 
cause some side effects, including pulmonary toxicity. Interstitial lung disease 
is a rare but potentially serious event. We report a case of a 63-year-old 
patient with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. She received Gemcitabine 
1000 mg/m2 on day 1, and day 8, and presented on day 15 of the first cycle with 
respiratory distress rapidly aggravating. Clinical and radiological findings 
were concordant with interstitial lung disease. Management consisted of high 
doses of corticosteroids and oxygen therapy. There was no clinical improvement 
and the patient passed away after a few days. Despite its low incidence, 
gemcitabine-induced interstitial lung disease may be responsible for a fatal 
clinical picture. Clinicians must be aware of this possibility and address 
respiratory symptoms as soon as possible.

BACKGROUND: Brain metastases (BM) are rare in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 
(PDAC) and little data exists concerning these patients and their outcomes.
AIM: We aimed to analyze the management, practices, and outcomes of patients 
presenting BM from PDAC both in our institution and in all cases reported in the 
literature.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, monocentric analysis using a data mining 
tool (ConSoRe) to identify all patients diagnosed with PDAC and BM in our 
comprehensive cancer center (Paoli-Calmettes Institute), from July 1997 to June 
2022 (cohort 1). Simultaneously, we reviewed and pooled the case reports and 
case series of patients with PDAC and BM in the literature (cohort 2). The 
clinical characteristics of patients in each cohort were described and survival 
analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: In cohort 1, 19 patients (0.3%) with PDAC and BM were identified with a 
median age of 69 years (range: 39-81). Most patients had metastatic disease 
(74%), including 21% with BM, at diagnosis. Lung metastases were present in 58% 
of patients. 68% of patients had neurological symptoms and 68% were treated by 
focal treatment (surgery: 21%, radiotherapy: 42%, Gamma Knife radiosurgery: 5%). 
In cohort 2, among the 61 PDAC patients with BM described in the literature, 59% 
had metastatic disease, including 13% with BM at diagnosis. Lung metastases were 
present in 36% of patient and BM treatments included: surgery (36%), 
radiotherapy (36%), radiosurgery (3%), or no local treatment (25%). After the 
pancreatic cancer diagnosis, the median time to develop BM was 7.8 months 
(range: 0.0-73.9) in cohort 1 and 17.0 months (range: 0.0-64.0) in cohort 2. 
Median overall survival (OS) in patients of cohort 1 and cohort 2 was 2.9 months 
(95% CI [1.7,4.0]) and 12.5 months (95% CI [7.5,17.5]), respectively.
CONCLUSION: BM are very uncommon in PDAC and seem to occur more often in younger 
patients with lung metastases and more indolent disease. BM are associated with 
poor prognosis and neurosurgery offers the best outcomes and should be 
considered when feasible.

PURPOSE: We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant SABR using 
magnetic resonance imaging-guided respiratory-gated adaptive radiation therapy 
(MRgRg-ART) in pancreatic cancer.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: We performed a single-institution retrospective review in 
patients with pancreatic cancer who underwent neoadjuvant SABR followed by 
surgical resection. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, those considered resectable 
by the multidisciplinary team received SABR over 5 consecutive days using 
MRgRg-ART. Factors associated with severe postoperative complications 
(Clavien-Dindo grade ≥III) and prognostic factors for overall survival were 
analyzed.
RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were included in the analysis, with a median 
follow-up of 10.3 months. The median prescribed dose to the planning target 
volume was 50 Gy. Fifty-two (85.3%) patients underwent R0 resection, and 11 
(18.0%) experienced severe postoperative complications. No factors were 
associated with the incidence of severe postoperative complications. There were 
3 cases of locoregional recurrence, resulting in a 12-month local control rate 
of 93.1%. Elevated postoperative carbohydrate antigen 19-9 was significantly 
associated with poor overall survival in the multivariate analysis (P = .037).
CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant SABR with 50 Gy using MRgRg-ART delivered to pancreatic 
cancer resulted in a notable survival outcome with acceptable toxicities. 
Further studies are warranted to investigate the long-term effects of this 
method.

PURPOSE: In our experience treating locally advanced pancreatic cancer with 
magnetic resonance-guided radiation therapy (MRgRT), the true-fast imaging with 
steady-state free precession sequences used to generate both the real-time 
2-dimensional (2D) magnetic resonance images (MRI; 2D cine) and the pretreatment 
high-resolution 3-dimensional (3D) MRI impart differing intensities for relevant 
structures between the 2 scans. Since these variations can confound target 
tracking selection, we propose that an understanding of the differing contrast 
profiles could improve selection of tracking structures.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively reviewed both 2D cine and 3D MRI 
images for 20 patients with pancreatic cancer treated with MRgRT. At simulation, 
an appropriate tracking target was identified and contoured on a single 3-mm 
sagittal slice of the 3D MRI. This sagittal slice was directly compared with the 
coregistered 7-mm 2D cine to identify structures with notable discrepancies in 
signal intensity. The 3D MRI was then explored in additional planes to confirm 
structure identities. For quantitative verification of the clinically observed 
differences, the pixel intensity distributions of 2D cine and 3D MRI digital 
imaging and communications in medicine data sets were statistically compared.
RESULTS: In all patients reviewed, arteries (aorta, celiac, superior mesenteric 
artery, hepatic artery) appeared mildly hyperintense on both scans. However, 
veins (portal vein, superior mesenteric vein) appeared hyperintense on 2D cine 
but isointense on 3D MRI. Biliary structures appeared mildly hyperintense on 2D 
cine but starkly hyperintense on 3D MRI. The pixel intensity distributions 
extracted from 2D cine and 3D MRI images were confirmed to differ significantly 
(2 sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; test statistic, 0.40; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: There are significant variations in image intensity between the 
immediate pretreatment 2D cine compared with the initial planning 3D MRI. 
Understanding variations of image intensity between the different MRI sequences 
used in MRgRT is valuable to radiation oncologists and may lead to improved 
target tracking and optimized treatment delivery.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a major contributor to global 
cancer-related mortality. While the inhibitory effect of metformin (Met) on PC 
has been reported, the underlying mechanism remains elusive.
METHODS: We established BxPC-3 cell models with miR-378a-3p and VEGFA knockdown. 
The expression of miR-378a-3p, VEGFA, and RGC-32 in PC and normal tissues was 
analyzed using GEPIA, TCGA databases. Cell proliferation, invasion, migration, 
and apoptosis were assessed through CCK8, Transwell, wound healing, and flow 
cytometry.
RESULTS: Significantly lower expression of miR-378a-3p was observed in PC 
tissues and cells. Knockdown of miR-378a-3p reversed the impact of Met on cell 
viability in PANC-1 and BxPC3. VEGFA emerged as a potential regulator in PC and 
a downstream target of miR-378a-3p. The interaction between VEGFA and RGC-32 
played a crucial role in PC regulation. Knockdown of VEGFA substantially 
reversed the impact of miR-378a-3p inhibitor on tumor growth and the 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Moreover, knockdown of VEGFA 
effectively countered the influence of miR-378a-3p inhibitor on cell viability 
and the EMT process in BxPC3 cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Met exerted inhibitory effects on PC through the 
miR-378a-3p/VEGFA/RGC-32 pathway. Strategies targeting the 
miR-378a-3p/VEGFA/RGC-32 axis represent a novel avenue for the prevention and 
treatment of PC.

This case report describes the diagnosis, treatment, and progression of a 
50-year-old male patient diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic leiomyosarcoma with 
metastases to the liver, lungs, and brain, representing the only case involving 
both the pancreas and brain documented in the hospital registry with a 
histopathological diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma. The patient initially presented 
with chronic abdominal pain, constipation, and weight loss, and subsequent CT 
scans revealed a large pancreatic mass with metastases to the liver, lungs, and 
brain. A biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma, and the patient 
underwent eight cycles of palliative chemotherapy with cisplatin and docetaxel, 
along with palliative radiotherapy targeting the brain metastases. Despite these 
interventions, the disease progressed, resulting in the patient experiencing 
altered mental status, generalized weakness, and seizure-like activity, 
reflecting the impact of the brain metastases and overall disease progression. 
His management included treatment with dexamethasone, antiseizure medications, 
and supportive care, while discussions about palliative care options were 
conducted with the family. This rare case highlights the aggressive nature of 
pancreatic leiomyosarcoma, characterized by rapid progression and resistance to 
chemotherapy and radiotherapy, with the involvement of multiple organ systems 
demonstrating the challenges associated with managing advanced metastatic 
leiomyosarcoma.

Invention and characterization of a systemically administered, attenuated and 
killed bacteria-based multiple immune receptor agonist for anti-tumor 
immunotherapy.

Activation of immune receptors, such as Toll-like (TLR), NOD-like (NLR) and 
Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) is critical for efficient innate and 
adaptive immunity. Gram-negative bacteria (G-NB) contain multiple TLR, NOD and 
STING agonists. Potential utility of G-NB for cancer immunotherapy is supported 
by observations of tumor regression in the setting of infection and Coley's 
Toxins. Coley reported that intravenous (i.v.) administration was likely most 
effective but produced uncontrollable toxicity. The discovery of TLRs and their 
agonists, particularly the potent TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS)-endotoxin, comprising ~75% of the outer membrane of G-NB, suggests that 
LPS may be both a critical active ingredient and responsible for dose-limiting 
i.v. toxicity of G-NB. This communication reports the production of killed, 
stabilized, intact bacteria products from non-pathogenic G-NB with ~96% 
reduction of LPS-endotoxin activity. One resulting product candidate, Decoy10, 
was resistant to standard methods of cell disruption and contained TLR2,4,8,9, 
NOD2 and STING agonist activity. Decoy10 also exhibited reduced i.v. toxicity in 
mice and rabbits, and a largely uncompromised ability to induce cytokine and 
chemokine secretion by human immune cells in vitro, all relative to unprocessed, 
parental bacterial cells. Decoy10 and a closely related product, Decoy20, 
produced single agent anti-tumor activity or combination-mediated durable 
regression of established subcutaneous, metastatic or orthotopic colorectal, 
hepatocellular (HCC), pancreatic, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) tumors in 
mice, with induction of both innate and adaptive immunological memory (syngeneic 
and human tumor xenograft models). Decoy bacteria combination-mediated 
regressions were observed with a low-dose, oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drug (NSAID), anti-PD-1 checkpoint therapy, low-dose cyclophosphamide (LDC), 
and/or a targeted antibody (rituximab). Efficient tumor eradication was 
associated with plasma expression of 15-23 cytokines and chemokines, broad 
induction of cytokine, chemokine, innate and adaptive immune pathway genes in 
tumors, cold to hot tumor inflammation signature transition, and required NK, 
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, collectively demonstrating a role for both innate and 
adaptive immune activation in the anti-tumor immune response.

The initial stages of acute pancreatitis (AP) are characterized by a significant 
event - acinar ductal metaplasia (ADM). This process is a crucial feature of 
both acute and chronic pancreatitis, serving as the first step in the 
development of pancreatic cancer. Ion channels are integral transmembrane 
proteins that play a pivotal role in numerous biological processes by modulating 
ion flux. In many diseases, the expression and activity of ion channels are 
often dysregulated. Metal ions, including calcium ions (Ca2+), ferrous ions 
(Fe2+), and Copper ions (Cu2+), assume a distinctive role in cellular 
metabolism. These ions possess specific biological properties relevant to 
cellular function. However, the interactions among these ions exacerbate the 
imbalance within the intracellular environment, resulting in cellular damage and 
influencing the progression of AP. A more in-depth investigation into the 
mechanisms by which these ions interact with acinar cells is essential for 
elucidating AP's pathogenesis and identifying novel therapeutic strategies. 
Currently, treatment for AP primarily focuses on pain relief, complications 
prevention, and prognosis improvement. There are limited specific treatments 
targeting acinous cell dedifferentiation or ion imbalance. This study aims to 
investigate potential therapeutic strategies by examining ion crosstalk within 
acinar cells in the context of acute pancreatitis.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic potential of 
combining clinical features and radiomics with multiple machine learning (ML) 
algorithms in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).
METHODS: A total of 116 patients with PDAC who met the eligibility criteria were 
randomly assigned to a training or validation cohort. Seven ML algorithms, 
including Supervised Principal Components, stepwise Cox, Random Survival Forest, 
CoxBoost, Least absolute shrinkage and selection operation (Lasso), Ridge, and 
Elastic network, were integrated into 43 algorithm combinations. Forty-three 
radiomics models were constructed separately using radiomics features extracted 
from arterial phase (AP), venous phase (VP), and combined arterial and venous 
phase (AP+VP) images. The concordance index (C-index) of each model was 
calculated. The model with the highest mean C-index was identified as the best 
model for calculating the radiomics score (Radscore). Univariate and 
multivariate Cox analyses were used to identify independent prognostic 
indicators and create a clinical model for prognosis prediction. The 
multivariable Cox regression was used to combine Radscore with clinical features 
to create a combined model. The efficacy of the model was evaluated using the 
C-index, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULTS: The model based on the Lasso+StepCox[both] algorithm constructed using 
AP+VP radiomics features showed the best predictive ability among the 114 
radiomics models. The C-indices of the model in the training and validation 
cohorts were 0.742 and 0.722, respectively. Based on the results of the 
univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, sex, Tumor-Node-Metastasis 
(TNM) stage, and systemic inflammation response index were included to build the 
clinical model. The combined model, incorporating three clinical factors and 
AP+VP-Radscore, achieved the highest C-indices of 0.764 and 0.746 in the 
training and validation cohorts, respectively. In terms of preoperative 
prognosis prediction for PDAC, the calibration curve and DCA showed that the 
combined model had a good consistency and greatest net benefit.
CONCLUSION: A combined model of clinical features and AP+VP-Radscore screened 
using multiple ML algorithms has an excellent ability to predict the prognosis 
of PDAC and may provide a noninvasive and effective method for clinical 
decision-making.

Identification of the MRTFA/SRF pathway as a critical regulator of quiescence in 
cancer.

Chemoresistance is a major driver of cancer deaths. One understudied mechanism 
of chemoresistance is quiescence. We used single cell culture to identify, 
retrieve, and RNA-Seq profile primary quiescent ovarian cancer cells (qOvCa). We 
found that many qOvCa differentially expressed genes are transcriptional targets 
of the Myocardin Related Transcription Factor/Serum Response Factor (MRTF/SRF) 
pathway. We also found that genetic disruption of MRTF-SRF interaction, or an 
MRTF/SRF inhibitor (CCG257081) impact qOvCa gene expression and induce a 
quiescent state in cancer cells. Suggesting a broad role for this pathway in 
quiescence, CCG257081 treatment induced quiescence in breast, lung, colon, 
pancreatic and ovarian cancer cells. Furthermore, CCG081 (i) maintained a 
quiescent state in patient derived breast cancer organoids and, (ii) induced 
tumor growth arrest in ovarian cancer xenografts. Together, these data suggest 
that MRTF/SRF pathway is a critical regulator of quiescence in cancer and a 
possible therapeutic target.
SIGNIFICANCE: Quiescence is a critical driver of chemoresistance. The MRFT-SRF 
pathway regulates cancer cell quiescence and inhibiting the MRTF-SRF pathway can 
prevent the outgrowth of quiescent cancer cells and improve cancer outcomes.

Aberrant expression of collagen type X in solid tumor stroma is associated with 
EMT, immunosuppressive and pro-metastatic pathways, bone marrow stromal cell 
signatures, and poor survival prognosis.

Famili-Youth EHH, Famili-Youth A, Yang D, Siddique A, Wu EY, Liu W, Resnick MB, 
Chen Q, Brodsky AS.

BACKGROUND: Collagen type X (ColXα1, encoded by COL10A1 ) is expressed 
specifically in the cartilage-to-bone transition, in bone marrow cells, and in 
osteoarthritic (OA) cartilage. We have previously shown that ColXα1 is expressed 
in breast tumor stroma, correlates with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and 
predicts poor adjuvant therapy outcomes in ER + /HER2 + breast cancer. However, 
the underlying molecular mechanisms for these effects are unknown. In this 
study, we performed bioinformatic analysis of COL10A1 -associated gene modules 
in breast and pancreatic cancer as well as in cells from bone marrow and OA 
cartilage. These findings provide important insights into the mechanisms of 
transcriptional and extracellular matrix changes which impact the local stromal 
microenvironment and tumor progression.
METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was performed to examine collagen type X 
expression in solid tumors. WGCNA was used to generate COL10A1 -associated gene 
networks in breast and pancreatic tumor cohorts using RNA-Seq data from The 
Cancer Genome Atlas. Computational analysis was employed to assess the impact of 
these gene networks on development and progression of cancer and OA. Data 
processing and statistical analysis was performed using R and various 
publicly-available computational tools.
RESULTS: Expression of COL10A1 and its associated gene networks highlights 
inflammatory and immunosuppressive microenvironments, which identify aggressive 
breast and pancreatic tumors and contribute to metastatic potential in a 
sex-dependent manner. Both cancer types are enriched in stroma, and COL10A1 
implicates bone marrow-derived fibroblasts as drivers of the 
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in these tumors. Heightened 
expression of COL10A1 and its associated gene networks is correlated with poorer 
patient outcomes in both breast and pancreatic cancer. Common transcriptional 
changes and chondrogenic activity are shared between cancer and OA cartilage, 
suggesting that similar microenvironmental alterations may underlie both 
diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: COL10A1 -associated gene networks may hold substantial value as 
regulators and biomarkers of aggressive tumor phenotypes with implications for 
therapy development and clinical outcomes. Identification of tumors which 
exhibit high expression of COL10A1 and its associated genes may reveal the 
presence of bone marrow-derived stromal microenvironments with heightened EMT 
capacity and metastatic potential. Our analysis may enable more effective risk 
assessment and more precise treatment of patients with breast and pancreatic 
cancer.
RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS: ColX highlights features of EMT in breast and pancreatic 
cancerColX gene modules are immunosuppressive and pro-metastaticColX-associated 
gene networks contribute to sex differences in pancreatic cancerColX-positive 
fibroblasts define more aggressive tumors with poorer survivalColX is emerging 
as a biomarker for bone marrow-derived cells in cancer.

Elevated expression of components of eIF4F translation initiation complex has 
been documented in cancer, resulting in enhanced translation of mRNAs encoding 
pro-tumorigenic factors, including oncogenic proteins. We previously identified 
SBI-756, a small molecule that interferes with the eIF4F assembly and overcomes 
melanoma resistance to BRAF inhibitors. SBI-756 enhanced anti-tumor immunity in 
pancreatic cancer and was effective in the treatment of diffuse large B cell 
lymphoma. Here, we identified the eIF4G1 MA3 (4G1-MA3) domain as the target of 
SBI-756, attenuating eIF4F complex assembly. Melanoma cells expressing a mutant 
form of 4G1-MA3 exhibited polysome profiles resembling those of melanoma cells 
treated with SBI-756. A structure-based in silico screen against the eIF4G1 MA3 
domain identified M19, a small molecule inhibitor that exhibited anti-melanoma 
effects. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed upregulation of UPR, mTOR, p53, and 
ROS signaling in M19-treated melanoma cells. Ribosome sequencing identified 
changes in ribosomal structure and electron transport chain components following 
M19-6 treatment of melanoma cells. Autophagy and histone deacetylase inhibitors 
were found to enhance anti-neoplastic activities of M19 or its analog, M19-6. 
M19-6 conferred a greater effect on melanoma than melanocytes and overcame 
melanoma resistance to BRAF or MEK inhibitors. Alone, M19-6 reduced melanoma 
growth and metastasis in a xenograft model. M19-6 offers a new therapeutic 
modality to overcome resistance and metastasis.

Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a highly lethal malignancy that 
currently lacks effective clinical treatments. Eliminating stem cell-like cancer 
cells is an extremely promising but challenging strategy for treating ICC. A 
recently developed synthetic retinoid, sulfarotene, abrogates proliferation, and 
induces apoptosis of tumor-repopulating cells (TRCs) that exhibit stem cell-like 
properties, yet its effect and underlying mechanisms remain elusive in ICC. It 
is found that although 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin, pemigatinib, and gemcitabine 
all inhibit ICC-TRCs, sulfarotene demonstrates superior efficacy. Sulfarotene 
induces retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARɑ) translocation from the cytoplasm to 
the nucleus, suppressing P-selectin expression at the transcriptional level. 
Moreover, it directly interacts with fucosyltransferase 8 (FUT8), inhibiting the 
core fucosylation of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL1). These actions 
collectively inhibit ICC-TRCs via destroying PSGL1-regulated cytoskeleton. The 
findings provide a strategy of inhibiting P-selectin/PSGL1 interaction and 
altering PSGL1 glycosylation pattern to compromise the cytoskeletal integrity 
and eliminate ICC-TRCs.

BACKGROUND: Clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (CR-POPF) is a 
common postoperative complication after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) and is 
associated with severe complications. Drainage is an effective method to treat 
POPF and prevent POPF-related complications. However, controversy still exists 
about whether different drainage methods reduce the incidence or the severity of 
POPF after PD.
METHODS: A closed suction drainage was placed posterior to 
pancreaticojejunostomy in PD except for other routine drainage placements. A 
retrospective study was conducted to calculate the incidence and severity of 
CR-POPF and POPF-related complications and to evaluate the efficacy of this 
drainage method.
RESULTS: 295 patients who underwent PD were enrolled in this study, 130 patients 
in the trial group and 165 patients in the control group. The two groups were 
comparable in both preoperative and intraoperative characteristics. The overall 
incidence of CR-POPF was similar between the two groups. The trial group had a 
significantly decreased incidence of grade C POPF (0% vs. 3.6%, p < 0.05), 
post-pancreatectomy hemorrhage (PPH) (0% vs. 6.1%, p = 0.003), reoperation (0% 
vs. 3.6%, p = 0.036), intra-abdominal infection (13.1% vs. 25.5%, p = 0.008), 
and delayed gastric emptying (DGE) (2.3% vs. 8.5%, p = 0.024) than the control 
group. Subgroup analysis of patients with intermediate/high risk for CR-POPF 
mirrored these results. Logistic regression identified obstructive jaundice, 
biliary fistula, POPF, and DGE as independent risk factors for PPH and 
reoperation, though the results were not significant in multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: The drainage posterior to pancreaticojejunostomy reduces the 
severity of POPF and the incidence of POPF-related complications after PD.

Human stem cells are undifferentiated cells with the capacity for self-renewal 
and differentiation into distinct cell lineages, playing important role in the 
development and maintenance of diverse tissues and organs. The microenvironment 
of stem cell provides crucial factors and components that exert significant 
influence over the determination of cell fate. Among these factors, cytokines 
from the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) superfamily, including TGFβ, bone 
morphogenic protein (BMP), Activin and Nodal, have been identified as important 
regulators governing stem cell maintenance and differentiation. In this review, 
we present a comprehensive overview of the pivotal roles played by TGFβ 
superfamily signaling in governing human embryonic stem cells, somatic stem 
cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, and cancer stem cells. Furthermore, we 
summarize the latest research and advancements of TGFβ family in various cancer 
stem cells and stem cell-based therapy, discussing their potential clinical 
applications in cancer therapy and regeneration medicine.

Melatonin, a hormone primarily produced by the pineal gland, exhibits a range of 
physiological functions that extend beyond its well-known role in regulating 
circadian rhythms. This hormone influences energy metabolism, modulates insulin 
sensitivity, and plays a significant role in controlling sleep patterns and food 
intake. Notably, melatonin is also synthesized in various peripheral organs, 
including the gastrointestinal system and pancreas, suggesting its function as a 
local hormone. The presence of melatonin receptors in the pancreas underscores 
its relevance in pancreatic physiology. Pancreatic disorders, such as diabetes 
mellitus (DM), pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer, often stem from inflammatory 
processes. The majority of these conditions are characterized by dysregulated 
immune responses and oxidative stress. Melatonin's anti-inflammatory properties 
are mediated through the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the 
activation of antioxidant enzymes, which help to mitigate cellular damage. 
Furthermore, melatonin has demonstrated pro-apoptotic effects on cancer cells, 
promoting cell death in malignant tissues while preserving healthy cells. Thus, 
melatonin emerges as a multifaceted agent with significant therapeutic potential 
for pancreatic disorders. Its ability to reduce inflammation and oxidative 
stress positions it as a promising adjunct therapy for conditions such as 
diabetes mellitus, pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer. By modulating immune 
responses and enhancing cellular resilience through antioxidant mechanisms, 
melatonin not only addresses the symptoms but also targets the underlying 
pathophysiological processes associated with these disorders. This review aims 
to categorize and summarize the impacts of melatonin on pancreatic functions and 
disorders, emphasizing its potential as a therapeutic agent for managing 
pancreatic dysfunctions. Future research should focus on elucidating the precise 
mechanisms by which melatonin exerts its protective effects on pancreatic 
tissues and exploring optimal dosing strategies for clinical applications. The 
integration of melatonin into treatment regimens may enhance existing therapies 
and offer new hope for individuals suffering from pancreatic dysfunctions.

BACKGROUND: Because of the unique tumor microenvironment (TME), immunotherapy 
and targeted therapies have shown limited efficacy in treating pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma (PAAD). CD8 + T cells play crucial roles in regulating the TME in 
PAAD; therefore, exploring the function of CD8 + T-cell-related genes (CD8RGs) 
in PAAD has high potential clinical value and could provide a comprehensive 
understanding of the microenvironment of PAAD.
METHODS: We employed the weighted gene coexpression network analysis and 
CIBERSORT algorithms to assess PAAD transcriptome data from The Cancer Genome 
Atlas (TCGA) dataset and identify modules strongly associated with CD8 + T cell 
infiltration. Using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression 
analysis and Kaplan-Meier curves, we developed a prognostic risk score model for 
patients with PAAD. We validated this model using single-cell and transcriptome 
datasets obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). We also examined the 
correlations between the risk score and factors such as the TME, clinical 
characteristics, and tumor mutation burden (TMB). Gene Ontology and Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis were performed on 
differentially expressed genes between the high- and low-risk groups. In 
addition, the Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion website and "pRRophetic" R 
package were used to predict response to immunotherapy and chemotherapy in the 
high- and low-risk groups, respectively. Finally, we analyzed the expressions of 
hub genes at the cellular level with quantitative real-time PCR.
RESULTS: A risk model based on five CD8RGs was established and validated using 
TCGA and GEO datasets. The low-risk group exhibited significantly longer overall 
and progression-free survival. A positive correlation between the TMB and the 
risk score was observed. The TME analysis revealed a significant correlation 
between the risk score and immune function, as well as immune checkpoints. The 
expression of hub genes was significantly correlated with the infiltration level 
of CD8 + T cells. The high-risk group responded better to immunotherapy, 
paclitaxel, cisplatin, mitomycin C, afatinib (BIBW2992), and gefitinib. In 
contrast, the low-risk group showed higher sensitivity to sunitinib, MK.2206, 
palbociclib (PD.0332991), and axitinib. Compared with that in normal pancreatic 
epithelial cells, the expression levels of BCL11A, PHOSPHO1, and GNG7 were 
significantly decreased, while those of KLK11 and VCAM1 were significantly 
increased in pancreatic tumor cells.
CONCLUSIONS: CD8RGs play an important role in regulating the TME of PAAD. Five 
hub genes-BCL11A, KLK11, GNG7, PHOSPHO1, and VCAM1-are closely associated with 
the prognosis of PAAD patients, providing new references for the exploration of 
biomarkers. Furthermore, our findings offer novel insights for clinical 
decision-making.

Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal malignancies, with limited 
treatment options and poor prognosis. A common characteristic among pancreatic 
cancer patients is the biomechanically altered tumor microenvironment (TME), 
which among others is responsible for the elevated mechanical stresses in the 
tumor interior. Although significant research has elucidated the effect of 
mechanical stress on cancer cell proliferation and migration, it has not yet 
been investigated how it could affect cancer cell drug sensitivity. Here, we 
demonstrated that mechanical stress triggers autophagy activation, correlated 
with increased resistance to oxaliplatin treatment in pancreatic cancer cells. 
Our results demonstrate that inhibition of autophagy using hydroxychloroquine 
(HCQ) enhanced the oxaliplatin-induced apoptotic cell death in pancreatic cancer 
cells exposed to mechanical stress. The combined treatment of HCQ with losartan, 
a known modulator of mechanical abnormalities in tumors, synergistically 
enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of oxaliplatin in murine pancreatic tumor 
models. Furthermore, our study revealed that the use of HCQ enhanced the 
efficacy of losartan to alleviate mechanical stress levels and restore blood 
vessel integrity beyond its role in autophagy modulation. These findings 
underscore the potential of co-targeting mechanical stresses and autophagy as a 
promising therapeutic strategy to overcome drug resistance and increase 
chemotherapy efficacy.

Pancreatic cancer is highly lethal and has limited treatment options available. 
Our team had previously developed ZZW-115, a promising drug candidate that 
targets the nuclear protein 1 (NUPR1), which is involved in pancreatic cancer 
development and progression. However, clinical translation of ZZW-115 was 
hindered due to potential cardiotoxicity caused by its interaction with the 
human Ether-à-go-go-Related Gene (hERG) potassium channel. To address this, we 
have performed a high-throughput screening of 10,000 compounds from the 
HitFinder Chemical Library, and identified AJO14 as a lead compound that binds 
to NUPR1, without having favorable affinity towards hERG. AJO14 induced cell 
death through apoptosis, necroptosis, and parthanatos (induced by the poly-ADP 
ribose polymerase (PARP) overactivation), driven by mitochondrial catastrophe 
and decreased ATP production. This process seemed to be mediated by the 
hyperPARylation (an excessive modification of proteins by PARP, leading to 
cellular dysfunction), as it could be reversed by Olaparib, a PARP inhibitor. In 
xenografted mice, AJO14 demonstrated a dose-dependent tumor reduction activity. 
Furthermore, we attempted to improve the anti-cancer properties of AJO14 by 
molecular modification of the lead compound. Among the 51 candidates obtained 
and tested, 8 compounds exhibited a significant increase in efficacy and have 
been retained for further studies, especially LZX-2-73. These AJO14-derived 
compounds offer potent NUPR1 inhibition for pancreatic cancer treatment, without 
cardiotoxicity concerns.

BACKGROUND: Cancer cachexia can impact prognosis, cause resistance to anticancer 
treatments and affect the tolerability of treatments. This study aims to 
identify hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with cachexia by characterizing 
longitudinal body composition (BC) trajectories.
METHODS: This longitudinal, multicentre cohort study included unresectable HCC 
patients treated with first-line programmed death-(ligand)1 inhibitors plus 
anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibody/tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
between 01/2018-12/2022. BC measurements including skeletal muscle mass (SMM) 
and total adipose tissue area (TATA) were evaluated by computed tomography at 
the third lumbar vertebra at baseline and follow-up imaging. Unsupervised latent 
class growth mixed models were applied to distinguish potential longitudinal SMM 
and TATA trajectories for identifying cachexia. The primary study endpoint was 
overall survival (OS), with secondary endpoints including progression-free 
survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR) and safety. Multiple Cox 
proportional hazards models were used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) 
for survival.
RESULTS: A total of 411 patients with 2138 time-point measurements were 
included. The median age was 56 years, and 50 (12.2%) patients were female. Two 
distinct trajectories were identified for SMM and TATA: sharp-falling and 
stable. SMM sharply declined in 58 patients (14.1%) and TATA in 71 of 406 
patients (17.5%) with significant worse OS (for SMM, 17.0 vs. 24.9 months; 
p < 0.001; HR = 0.59; for TATA, 15.3 vs. 25.1 months; p < 0.001; HR = 0.44). 
Patients were categorized into three phases based on trajectories: pre-cachexia 
(SMM and TATA stable, n = 299, 73.6%), cachexia (SMM or TATA sharp-falling, 
n = 86, 21.2%) and refractory cachexia (SMM and TATA sharp-falling, n = 21, 
5.2%). Patients with refractory cachexia exhibited the worst OS, PFS and ORR, 
followed by those with cachexia. The median OS was 11.5 months for refractory 
cachexia, 17.7 for cachexia and 26.0 for pre-cachexia; median PFS was 6.0, 7.9 
and 10.9 months, respectively, with ORR of 4.8%, 39.5% and 54.2%, respectively 
(all ps < 0.001). Multivariable Cox analysis identified refractory cachexia as 
an independent risk factor for both OS (HR = 3.31; p < 0.001) and PFS 
(HR = 2.94; p < 0.001), with cachexia also showing significant impacts. Grade 
3-4 adverse events were higher in patients with refractory cachexia (23.8%) and 
cachexia (8.1%) compared with pre-cachexia (6.0%; p = 0.010).
CONCLUSIONS: HCC patients with cachexia and refractory cachexia were identified 
by longitudinal BC trajectories. Falling trajectories of BC identified 
refractory cachexia patients with worst response, survival and poor tolerability 
from systemic therapy combinations.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided transmural drainage with 
on-demand endoscopic necrosectomy (EN) is increasingly utilized to manage 
walled-off necrosis (WON). It has not been fully elucidated how EN and its 
timing are correlated with treatment outcomes compared to the drainage-based 
approach.
METHODS: Within a multi-institutional cohort of 423 patients with pancreatic 
fluid collections including 227 patients with WON, we identified 153 patients 
who received the step-up treatment following the initial EUS-guided drainage of 
symptomatic WON, including 102 EN patients and 51 non-EN (drainage) patients. 
Using the competing-risks multivariable proportional hazards regression model 
with adjustment for potential confounders, we calculated subdistribution hazard 
ratios (SHRs) for clinical treatment success (WON resolution) by the use of EN 
and its timing.
RESULTS: Compared to drainage alone, the EN-based treatment was associated with 
a shorter time to clinical success with a multivariable SHR of 1.66 (95% 
confidence interval, 1.12-2.46). Despite a higher risk of procedure-related 
bleeding in the EN group, there were no differences in the rates of severe 
adverse events (7.8% vs. 5.9% in the EN and non-EN groups, respectively) and 
mortality (6.9% vs. 9.8%). In the EN-treated patients, the timing of EN was not 
statistically significantly associated with the time to clinical success (Ptrend 
= 0.34) CONCLUSION: Among patients receiving EUS-guided treatment of symptomatic 
WON, the use of EN in addition to drainage procedures was associated with 
earlier disease resolution. Further research is desired to determine the optimal 
timing of initiating EN considering a risk-benefit balance and 
cost-effectiveness.

Immunotoxin has become a highly promising therapy for treating cancer and has 
achieved good results in preclinical trials targeting various cancers. However, 
there are still some issues that limit the development and application of 
immunotoxins, such as short half-life and toxic side effects on healthy tissues. 
In this study, we designed a tumor-conditional immunotoxin called 
NbHSA-uPA-A1-PE24. Anti-HSA nanobody (NbHSA) was fused to the N-terminus of 
A1-PE24 (immunotoxin targeting mesothelin) via a linker cleavable by 
tumor-associated proteases, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). NbHSA 
binds to HSA (human serum albumin) in the blood circulation, which not only 
prolongs the half-life of immunotoxins, but also creates a certain spatial 
barrier between A1 and mesothelin, thereby reducing the toxicity of 
NbHSA-uPA-A1-PE24 to healthy tissues expressing mesothelin. Moreover, uPA 
cleavable element rendered the immunotoxin conditional activation specifically 
in tumor microenvironment. In animal experiments, the half-life of the newly 
designed immunotoxins was increased dramatically. Noted, NbHSA-uPA-A1-PE24 has 
better enrichment at tumor, and shows robust anti-tumor effects in multiple 
preclinical models, such as pancreatic cancer and gastric cancer models. The 
results indicate that this strategy has greater potential and higher safety for 
application in tumor treatment, providing new ideas and strategies for the 
development of immunotoxins for cancer patients.

While poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) have 
achieved specific clinical benefits in a subset of pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients, the potential role of the PARPi niraparib in 
PDAC necessitates further exploration. In this study, we demonstrated that 
Niraparib exhibited a pronounced inhibitory effect on autophagy in PDAC both in 
vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, this inhibition was primarily attributed to 
niraparib's ability to disrupt the fusion process between autophagosomes and 
lysosomes, while potentially exerting a relatively minor impact on the initial 
stage of autophagy. The blockade effect observed may be mediated via modulation 
of the ERK signaling pathway, and this effect can be mitigated by the 
application of an ERK inhibitor (FR180204). Notably, the combined treatment 
regimen of niraparib and gemcitabine failed to elicit the anticipated 
synergistic effects in wild-type PANC-1 cells, instead exhibiting pronounced 
antagonistic interactions. However, in gemcitabine-resistant PANC-1 cells, the 
combination of niraparib and gemcitabine exhibited modest additive effects. 
Furthermore, niraparib demonstrated a heightened cytotoxic potency against 
gemcitabine-resistant PANC-1 cells compared to wild-type PANC-1 cells, both in 
vitro and in vivo. Our research established that niraparib inhibits late-stage 
autophagy in PDAC, potentially representing a valuable salvage therapy for 
gemcitabine-resistant PDAC. Further clinical studies are justified.

BACKGROUND: Thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA), once the standard for pain 
management in major abdominal operations, is associated with postoperative 
complications, making preperitoneal continuous wound infiltration (CWI) a 
promising alternative. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of CWI and 
TEA in managing postoperative pain after open pancreatoduodenectomy.
METHODS: In a single-centre, randomized, open-label non-inferiority trial, adult 
patients undergoing elective open pancreatoduodenectomy were assigned to either 
CWI or TEA for pain management. The primary outcomes were mean pain scores at 
rest on the first 3 postoperative days (PODs), using an 11-point numeric rating 
scale, with a non-inferiority margin of 1 point or less. Secondary outcomes 
included pain scores at rest and during coughing on PODs 1, 2, and 3; total 
opioid consumption; incidence of postoperative complications; quality of 
postoperative recovery; and duration of hospital stay.
RESULTS: Among the 134 patients analysed (CWI 70, TEA 64), CWI was non-inferior 
to TEA in terms of mean pain scores at rest (mean difference -0.13, 95% c.i. 
-0.72 to 0.47). Additionally, CWI demonstrated superior pain relief at rest and 
higher-quality recovery scores on POD 3. Compared with CWI, TEA was associated 
with significantly decreased total opioid consumption and shortened time to the 
first passage of flatus, but a higher incidence of postoperative hypotension. No 
other outcome measures showed significant differences between the two groups.
CONCLUSION: CWI was non-inferior to TEA during the early postoperative period, 
and has emerged as a favourable alternative to TEA, offering better pain relief 
and enhanced recovery on POD 3. Registration number: NCT04375826 
(http://www.clinicaltrials.gov).

The genetic characteristics of pancreatic cancer (PC) are being revealed, but 
treatment strategies based on these profiles are developing slowly. About 
one-third of PC patients harbor SMAD4 mutations, with its homozygous deletions 
often accompanied by deletions of the malic enzyme 2 (ME2) gene, leading to 
upregulation of malic enzyme 3 (ME3) to eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS). 
We designed an aptamer-modified octahedral DNA nanostructure for targeted 
co-delivery of siRNA targeting ME3 (siME3) and doxorubicin (DOX). This 
nanostructure targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on the 
membrane of PC cells. Upon internalization, siME3 and DOX are released 
intracellularly. The siME3 effectively inhibited ME3 expression, diminishing the 
tumor cells' capacity to clear ROS. Moreover, DOX further increases the level of 
cellular ROS, and the sustained accumulation of ROS ultimately leads to 
apoptosis of ME2-deficient PC cells. This targeting nanostructure shows 
potential for enhancing collateral lethality in this PC subgroup.

BACKGROUND: The selection of the surgical approach for chronic pancreatitis (CP) 
is determined by various factors including inflammatory location, presence of 
pancreatic duct dilatation, or possibility of cancer. Total pancreatectomy (TP), 
with or without islet cell autotransplantation, is considered for patients with 
refractory CP after the failure of other surgical treatments. Considering the 
increasing incidence of CP requiring surgical treatment, the number of cases in 
which TP is performed after previous surgical treatment is expected to increase.
CASE PRESENTATION: We reported a case of TPIAT in a patient with alcoholic CP 
who had previously undergone Frey's procedure. During the operation, the 
sufficient length of the elevated jejunal loop for pancreaticojejunostomy in 
Frey's procedure allowed it to be used directly for biliary jejunostomy during 
TP. In addition, jejunojejunostomy from the previous operation could be used, 
and these methods contributed to simplifying the operative procedure. We need 
open hemostasis on post-operative day (POD) 1and a percutaneous drainage tube 
replacement for an intraperitoneal abscess on POD 24. The patient was discharged 
from the hospital on POD 37 with normal serum C-peptide level, which suggests 
favorable insulin secretion from transplanted islets, and the epigastric pain 
that suffered her preoperatively resulted in a dramatic improvement.
CONCLUSIONS: When performing the Frey's procedure, the elevated jejunal loop and 
Y-anastomosis jejunal loop with sufficient length allow them to be used directly 
for the reconstructions in the possible subsequent TP.

Most studies on the human gut microbiome have focused on the bacterial fraction 
rather than fungal biomics, which as resulted in an incomplete understanding of 
the fungal microbiome. Recent advances in microbiota detection and 
next-generation sequencing technology have boosted an increase in research on 
fungi. Symbiotic fungi have become increasingly influential in health and 
disease and modulate various physiologic functions within the host. Fungal 
infections can result in high morbidity and mortality rates and are 
life-threatening in some immunocompromised patients. In addition to bacterial 
dysbiosis, alterations in fungal communities are important and have been linked 
to many diseases, including asthma, mental illness, and various cancers. When 
investigating cancer it is imperative to consider the role of fungi alongside 
viruses and bacteria. This review examined the impact of intestinal fungi and 
peri-tumor fungi on tumorigenesis, cancer progression, and response to 
anticancer therapies. The review highlights the specific involvement of some 
fungal species in cancers include digestive tract tumors such as colorectal, 
pancreatic, liver, and gastric cancers, as well as non-digestive tract tumors 
such as lung, melanoma, breast, and ovarian cancers. Furthermore, fungal 
mechanisms of action, including fungus-host recognition and immune regulation, 
biofilm formation, toxin and metabolite production in the tumor 
microenvironment, and the complex effects of fungus-bacteria interactions on 
tumorigenesis and development, highlight the significance of potential 
biomarkers in cancer diagnosis and treatment.

BACKGROUND: The most frequently invaded margins on pancreatoduodenectomy 
specimens for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma are vascular margins, 
particularly the superior mesenteric artery (or mesopancreatic) margin. Due to 
limited exploration of the radiological aspect of the mesopancreas, the aim of 
this study was to evaluate mesopancreatic infiltration through imaging of 
patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma who underwent 
pancreatoduodenectomy, to correlate these findings with histopathology and 
evaluate their impact on survival.
METHODS: Data for all patients who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy for 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma from 2015 to 2021 were reviewed, including 
review of surgical margin histopathology and blinded review of preoperative 
diagnostic imaging. According to qualitative radiological assessment, the 
mesopancreas was characterized as having normal fat, fat stranding, or solid 
infiltration. Survival data were analysed using Cox regression.
RESULTS: A total of 149 patients were included. At baseline imaging, 
mesopancreatic fat stranding or solid infiltration was present in 47 patients 
(31.5%) and 20 patients (13.4%) respectively. Median overall survival and 
disease-free survival were significantly lower with mesopancreatic solid 
infiltration (17 and 8 months) compared with normal fat (30 and 14 months) and 
fat stranding (29 and 16 months) (P = 0.017 and 0.028 respectively). In 
multivariable analysis, pathological tumour size was an independent prognostic 
factor for overall survival, and tumour location in the uncinate process and 
pathological tumour size were independent prognostic factors for disease-free 
survival.
CONCLUSION: At diagnostic imaging, solid infiltration (but not fat stranding) of 
the mesopancreas is associated with a poor prognosis for pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma patients who undergo pancreatoduodenectomy. Pathological tumour 
size significantly influences the prediction of overall survival, and tumour 
location in the uncinate process and pathological tumour size significantly 
influence the prediction of disease-free survival, suggesting further 
exploration of underlying mechanisms related to retroperitoneal tumoral invasion 
of vascular margins and the mesopancreas.

BACKGROUND: The role of cellular senescence in the tumor microenvironment of 
pancreatic cancer (PC) remains unclear, particularly regarding its impact on 
prognosis and immunotherapy outcomes.
METHODS: We utilized single-cell sequencing datasets (GSE155698 and GSE154778) 
for pancreatic cancer from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and bulk 
RNA-seq data from the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) and 
International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) repositories, creating three 
patient cohorts: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort, PAAD-AU cohort, and 
PAAD-CA cohort. Dimensionality reduction cluster analysis processed the 
single-cell data, while weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and 
differential expression gene analysis were applied to bulk RNA-seq data. 
Prognostic models were developed using Cox proportional hazards (COX) and least 
absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, with validation 
through survival analysis, decision curve analysis, and principal component 
analysis (PCA). Tumor mutation data were analyzed using the "maftools" package, 
and the immune microenvironment was assessed with TIMER2 data.
RESULTS: We developed a senescence-related (SENR) six-gene prognostic signature 
for PC, which stratifies patients by risk, with high-risk groups showing poorer 
prognoses. This model also offers predictive insights into tumor mutations and 
immune microenvironment characteristics. Caveolin-1 (CAV1) emerged as a 
significant prognostic biomarker, with functional validation showing its role in 
promoting cancer cell proliferation and migration, highlighting its potential as 
a therapeutic target.
CONCLUSION: This study provides a novel senescence-related prognostic tool for 
PC, enhancing patient stratification for prognosis and immunotherapy, and 
identifies CAV1 as a key gene with clinical significance for targeted 
interventions.

Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an exceptionally deadly form of 
pancreatic cancer with an extremely low survival rate. From diagnosis to 
treatment, PDAC is highly challenging to manage. Studies have demonstrated that 
PDAC tumors in distinct regions of the pancreas exhibit unique characteristics, 
influencing symptoms, treatment responses, and survival rates. Gaining insight 
into the heterogeneity of PDAC tumors based on their location in the pancreas 
can significantly enhance overall management of PDAC. Previous studies have 
explored PDAC tumor heterogeneity across pancreatic subregions based on their 
genetic and molecular profiles through biopsy-based histologic assessment. 
However, biopsy examinations are highly invasive and impractical for large 
populations. Abdominal imaging, such as Computed Tomography (CT) offers a 
completely non-invasive means to evaluate PDAC tumor heterogeneity across 
pancreatic subregions and an opportunity to correlate image feature of tumors 
with treatment outcome and monitoring. In this study, we explored the 
inter-tumor heterogeneity in PDAC tumors across three primary pancreatic 
subregions: the head, body, and tail. Utilizing contrast-enhanced abdominal CT 
scans and a thorough radiomic analysis of PDAC tumors, several morphological and 
textural tumor features were identified to be notably different between tumors 
in the head and those in the body and tail regions. To validate the significance 
of the identified features, a machine learning ML model was trained to 
automatically classify PDAC tumors into their respective regions i.e. head or 
body/tail subregion using their CT features. The study involved 200 CT abdominal 
scans, with 100 used for radiomic analysis and model training, and the remaining 
100 for model testing. The ML model achieved an average classification accuracy, 
sensitivity, and specificity of 87%, 86%, and 88% on the testing scans 
respectively. Evaluating the heterogeneity of PDAC tumors across pancreatic 
subregions provides valuable insights into tumor composition and has the 
potential to enhance diagnosis and personalize treatment based on tumor 
characteristics and location.

In this editorial, we comment on the in-press article in the World Journal of 
Gastrointestinal Endoscopy concerning the treatment of malignant gastric outlet 
obstruction (mGOO). The original theory of treatment involves bypassing the 
obstruction or reenabling the patency of the passage. Conventional surgical 
gastroenterostomy provides long-term relief of symptoms in selected patients, 
with substantial morbidity and a considerable rate of delayed gastric emptying. 
Endoscopic stenting was introduced as an alternative minimally invasive 
procedure with less procedural morbidity and rapid clinical improvement; 
however, it presented a high rate of long-term recurrence. Therefore, challenges 
remain in the treatment of mGOO patients to improve clinical outcomes. 
Endoscopic ultrasound-guided gastroenterostomy has recently emerged as a 
promising method because of the combined effects of surgery and endoscopy, 
whereas stomach-partitioning gastrojejunostomy has been reported as a modified 
surgical procedure to reduce the rate of delayed gastric emptying. In 
decision-making regarding the treatment of choice, it should be taken into 
account that mGOO might be accompanied by a variety of pathological conditions, 
including cancer cachexia, anorexia, malabsorption, and etc., all of which can 
also lead to the characteristic symptoms and poor nutritional status of mGOO. 
The treatment plan should consider comprehensive aspects of patients to achieve 
practical improvements in prognosis and the quality of life.

IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis (IgG4-SC) is an inflammatory disease that 
leads to bile duct stricture, characterized by the infiltration of IgG4-positive 
plasma cells into the bile duct wall, thickening of the bile duct wall, and 
narrowing of the lumen. The differential diagnosis of IgG4-SC mainly includes 
primary sclerosing cholangitis, cholangiocarcinoma, and pancreatic cancer. 
IgG4-SC is often associated with autoimmune pancreatitis and can be accurately 
diagnosed based on clinical diagnostic criteria. However, isolated IgG4-SC is 
difficult to distinguish from biliary tumors. Given the significant differences 
in biological behavior, treatment, and prognosis between these diseases, 
accurately identifying isolated IgG4-SC has very important clinical 
significance.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks as the fourth most common cause of 
mortality globally among all cancer types. Programmed cell death (PCD) is a 
crucial biological mechanism governing cancer progression, tumor expansion, and 
metastatic dissemination. Furthermore, the tumor microenvironment (TME) is 
critical in influencing overall survival (OS) and immune responses to 
immunotherapeutic interventions. From a multi-omics perspective, the combination 
of PCD and TME could help to predict the survival of HCC patient survival and 
immunotherapy response. Our study analyzed variations in the PCD- and 
TME-classifier used in the classification of HCC patients into two subgroups: 
PCD high-TME low and PCD low-TME high. In the following step, we compared the 
tumor somatic mutation (TMB), immunotherapy response, and functional annotation 
of both groups of patients. Lastly, Western Blot (WB) were conducted. The 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on the Human Protein Atlas (HPA). In 
the PCD-TME classifier, 23 PCD-related genes and three immune cell types were 
identified. Patients' prognoses and responses to therapy could be accurately 
predicted using this model. The findings of this study provide a new instrument 
for the clinical management of HCC patients, and they contribute to the 
development of accurate treatment strategies for these patients.

BACKGROUND: High-fat diets (HFDs) have been associated with an increased risk of 
pancreatic cancer. In contrast, ketogenic diets (KDs) have been shown to display 
anti-tumor characteristics. The objective of this work was to evaluate the 
efficacy of a KD on late-stage pancreatic carcinogenesis in a genetically 
modified mouse model of pancreatic cancer [LSL-KrasG12D/+; Ptf1-Cre (KC) mice], 
as well as its liver safety, and to compare it to that of an HFD.
METHODS: Six-month-old female and male KC mice were randomly allocated to either 
a control diet (CD) (%kcal: 20% fat, 15% protein, 65% carbohydrates), an HFD 
(%kcal: 40% fat, 15% protein, 45% carbohydrate) or a KD (%kcal: 84% fat, 15% 
protein, 1% carbohydrate) and fed these diets for 6 months.
RESULTS: HFD-fed, but not KD-fed, mice showed a 15% increase in body weight, 
plus elevated serum insulin (2.4-fold increase) and leptin (2.9-fold increase) 
levels, compared to CD-fed mice. At the pancreas level, no differences in 
pancreatic cancer incidence rates were observed among the diet groups. Regarding 
the liver safety profile, the HFD-fed mice had higher serum levels of alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline 
phosphatase (ALP), when compared to the CD and KD groups. In addition, upon 
histologic examination, an HFD, but not a KD, showed a ~2-fold increase in both 
macro- and microsteatosis, as well as 35% and 32% higher levels of TLR4 and 
NF-κB activation, respectively, compared to CD-fed mice.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, although a KD intervention alone did not prevent 
pancreatic carcinogenesis, our data suggests that a KD modulates insulin 
signaling and hepatic lipid metabolism, highlighting its beneficial effects on 
healthspan and liver function when compared to an HFD.

Background: Sarcopenia is a muscle disease that occur across a lifetime. It is 
commonly described in the aging population but can occur earlier in life in 
patients with cancer. Previous studies demonstrated sarcopenia is highly 
prevalent in patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours 
(GEP-NETs). In solid organ cancers, such as colorectal or pancreatic cancer, the 
presence of sarcopenia is associated with surgical complications. It is unknown 
if sarcopenia in patients with GEP-NETs is a risk factor for surgical 
complications. Methods: A multicentre retrospective study was performed in 
patients with a recently diagnosed GEP-NET and surgery to the primary tumour. CT 
scans were analysed for body composition analyses to assess for the presence of 
sarcopenia. Data regarding surgical procedures and complications were collected. 
Any major surgical complication was considered as Clavien-Dindo score ≥ 3. 
Results: This study included 180 patients, with 83 being male (46%) with a 
median age of 62 years (IQR 54-69). Most patients (n = 138, 77%) had a small 
intestinal NET, while 36 patients (20%) had pancreatic NETs. Sarcopenia was 
present in 109 patients (61%). In 43 patients (24%), surgical complications were 
recorded, and 21 complications (49%) were considered as major. Any type of 
surgical complication was not statistically different between patients without 
sarcopenia (n = 17, 24%) and with sarcopenia (n = 26, 24%)-a p-value of 0.36. 
This was the same for major complications; between patients without sarcopenia 
(n = 5, 24%) and with sarcopenia (n = 16, 76%)-a p-value of 0.18. Conclusions: 
Sarcopenia is highly prevalent in patients with a recently diagnosed GEP-NET, 
but this is not associated with major surgical complications. Future studies 
should include pathophysiological mechanisms that could be used to identify the 
causes of sarcopenia, its effect on quality of life and other oncological 
outcomes.

This study focuses on the synthesis of Biguanide-PROTACs, formed by conjugating 
the biguanide motif with a spacer and a ligand for recognition subunits of two 
E3 ubiquitin ligases. Evaluation of their activity on pancreatic cancer cell 
(KP4) proliferation established a correlation between membrane permeability and 
median effective concentration. Mechanistic insights revealed that only two 
compounds exhibited biguanide-like AMPK activation, while only one hydrophobic 
compound uniquely altered mitochondrial protein levels. The prospect of 
developing and expanding the Biguanide-PROTAC library holds several promises, 
offering potential insights into biguanide mechanisms and the creation of more 
potent anticancer agents. This study contributes to understanding the intricate 
interplay between compound structure, permeability, and anticancer activity, 
paving the way for targeted drug development in pancreatic cancer treatment.

Due to the high prostate cancer incidence worldwide, the development of 
different methods of treatment continues to be a hot research topic. Since its 
first clinical application at the beginning of the 2010s, abiraterone in the 
form of prodrug abiraterone acetate continues to be the most used hormone 
derivative in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer. This is the 
reason behind the publication of many scientific results regarding its 
synthesis, biological activity, metabolism, novel designed steroid derivatives 
based on its structure, etc. A similar steroid compound with a heterocycle in 
the C17 position, called galeterone, also designed to treat prostate cancer, 
continues to be in clinical studies, which provides further proof of the 
importance of these steroid derivatives. Besides prostate cancer treatment, 
abiraterone showed indications for possible clinical application in the 
treatment of breast, ovarian, lung, kidney, salivary gland, and adrenocortical 
cancer, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing's syndrome, and COVID-19, while 
galeterone is investigated for its use against prostate, pancreatic, and breast 
cancer. Herein, we report a review comprising methods of synthesis, possible 
clinical applications, and mechanisms of action, as well as structures and 
bioactivities of derivatives of these two important steroids.

Modern lifestyle diseases remain a persistent challenge in healthcare. 
Currently, about 422 million people worldwide are affected by diabetes, while 1 
in 8 people are living with obesity. The development of glucagon-like peptide 1 
receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) has marked a significant milestone in treating 
these conditions. Interest in GLP-1RAs has grown due to evidence that, beyond 
their established role in diabetes management, these drugs influence other 
metabolic disorders. This is attributed to the fact that GLP-1 receptors are 
found in various healthy human tissues. However, a potential cause for concern 
is the expression of GLP-1 receptors in certain cancers. This review focuses on 
the most recent findings concerning the actions of GLP-1RAs, detailing their 
documented impact on the thyroid gland and pancreas. It addresses concerns about 
the long-term use of GLP-1RAs in relation to the development of pancreatitis, 
pancreatic cancer, and thyroid neoplasms by exploring the mechanisms and 
long-term effects in different patient subgroups and including data not 
discussed previously. This review was conducted through an examination of the 
literature available in the MedLine (PubMed) database, covering publications 
from 1978 to 10 May 2024. The collected articles were selected based on their 
relevance to studies of GLP-1 agonists and their effects on the pancreas and 
thyroid and assessed to meet the established inclusion criteria. The revised 
papers suggest that prolonged use of GLP-1RA could contribute to the formation 
of thyroid tumors and may increase the risk of acute inflammatory conditions 
such as pancreatitis, particularly in high-risk patients. Therefore, physicians 
should advise patients on the need for more frequent and detailed follow-ups.

Glypican-3 and Cytokeratin-19 Expression in Pancreatic Cancer in a Canadian 
Population.

Background/Objectives: One study of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma has found 
expression of glypican-3 (GPC3) and cytokeratin-19 (CK19) determined by 
immunohistochemistry to be associated with higher stage and grade disease, with 
a more adverse prognosis. The reported 44% rate of GPC3 expression in pancreatic 
cancer raises the important possibility that targeted immunotherapies currently 
in development for hepatocellular carcinoma may also prove useful for 
GPC3-expressing pancreatic cancers. The present study aims to determine if a 
similar expression pattern of these markers and stage/grade/prognostic 
associations is present in our Canadian patient population. Methods: Patients 
with a pancreatic surgical resection for adenocarcinoma or neuroendocrine tumor 
(NET) were identified from pathology records over a 5-year period. 
Immunohistochemistry for GPC3 and CK19 was performed on archived tumor tissue 
and the proportion of positive cells and intensity of staining were recorded. 
Grade, stage, and overall survival were compared in patients with NETs that were 
CK19-positive versus -negative. Results: All 72 pancreatic adenocarcinomas and 
20 NETs tested were negative for GPC3, apart from a single case of pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma. All 72 adenocarcinomas were positive for CK19 expression. Half 
of the NETs were positive for CK19. There was no correlation between CK19 
expression in NETs and tumor grade, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, 
or overall survival. Conclusions: We are skeptical of the reported prognostic 
value of GPC3 and CK19 in pancreatic adenocarcinomas. CK19 as a prognostic 
marker in NETs has potential for further study. The results with our protocol 
for GPC3 immunohistochemistry suggest that pancreatic cancer may be a less 
promising target for GPC3-targeted immunotherapies than previously thought.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the 
deadliest cancers. Surgical resection is the most reliable chance for cure, but 
high rates of positive margins and local failure persist. Neoadjuvant therapies 
(NAT), including chemotherapy and radiation therapy (RT), are being explored to 
improve surgical outcomes, particularly in borderline resectable (BRPC) and 
locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). This review aims to summarize the 
current landscape and future directions for neoadjuvant RT (NART) in PDAC.
METHODS: The review includes a detailed analysis of past and ongoing clinical 
trials investigating various NART approaches in PDAC, with an emphasis on 
different RT techniques, fractionation schemes, and their integration into 
multimodal treatment strategies.
RESULTS: Early evidence suggests that NART can improve resection margins and 
local control. However, recent trials, including the Alliance A021501 and LAP-07 
trials, have failed to demonstrate significant survival benefits with the 
addition of RT to NAT. Nevertheless, nuances in trial design and execution 
continue to keep the question of NART open. Newer approaches, such as 
stereotactic magnetic resonance-guided adaptive radiation therapy (SMART), show 
promise in improving local control and survival, but further phase 3 trials are 
needed.
CONCLUSIONS: While NART has shown potential in improving local control in PDAC, 
its impact on overall survival remains unclear. Ongoing trials, particularly 
those utilizing advanced techniques like SMART, are critical in defining the 
role of RT in the neoadjuvant setting for PDAC. Collaboration across 
multidisciplinary teams is essential to optimize treatment strategies and trial 
outcomes.

Rare pancreatic tumors and non-neoplastic tumor-like lesions present a 
diagnostic challenge due to their uncommon occurrence and overlapping imaging 
characteristics with more prevalent pancreatic neoplasms. Advances in imaging 
technologies and diagnostic criteria have contributed to increased detection of 
these rare entities in clinical practice. This pictorial review focuses on the 
radiologic-pathologic correlation of rare pancreatic tumors, including colloid 
carcinoma, acinar cell carcinoma, pancreatoblastoma, primary pancreatic 
lymphoma, and non-neoplastic tumor-like lesions such as hamartomas and 
inflammatory pseudotumors. Detailed imaging features, such as signal intensities 
on MRI and enhancement patterns on CT, are correlated with pathological findings 
to assist in the differential diagnosis. Familiarity with these characteristics 
is crucial for radiologists to ensure accurate diagnosis and guide appropriate 
treatment strategies, as management and prognosis significantly differ from 
common pancreatic neoplasms.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is one of the most aggressive types of cancer. Among 
different mechanisms generally believed to be important for the development of 
cancer, aberrant regulation of the p53 protein is a well-known and common 
feature for many cancer entities. Our work aims to analyze the impact of p53 
deregulation and proteins encoded by p53 target genes on the survival of 
patients suffering from pancreatic adenocarcinoma. We, therefore, focused on the 
analysis of the selected collective for the TP53 mutation status, the p53 
protein level, their correlation, and possible impacts on the 
prognosis/survival. We compared and analyzed a set of 123 patients. We have 
extracted information regarding the TP53 mutation status, p53 protein levels, 
the level of proteins encoded by prominent p53 target genes, and information on 
the overall survival. Survival analyses were displayed by Kaplan-Meier plots, 
using the log-rank test, in order to check for statistical significance. Protein 
levels were compared using the Mann-Whitney Test. We did not find any 
statistically significant correlation between the TP53 mutation status and the 
survival of the patients. Moreover, we have not found any significant 
correlation between the protein amount of prominent p53 target genes and the 
patients' survival. However, we see a significant correlation between the p53 
protein level in cancer samples and the overall survival of pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma patients: patients having tumors with a p53 protein level within 
the upper quartile of all measured cases show a significantly reduced survival 
compared to the rest of the patients. Thus, in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, the 
p53 protein level is a relevant marker for prognosis, and cancers having a high 
p53 protein amount show a shortened patients' survival. In contrast, for this 
cancer entity, the TP53 mutation status or the protein amount of prominent p53 
target genes on their own seems not to have a significant impact on survival.

Disturbances in carbohydrate metabolism are suggested to be the early symptoms 
of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The accumulated data suggests that 
endocrine function-related biomarkers may represent a breakthrough in the early 
detection of PDAC. Factors which may predispose one to the development of PDAC 
are insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. Elevated insulin levels induce the 
onset of carcinogenesis by altering the differentiation and function of islet 
cells through stimulating growth factors, including insulin-like growth factors 
(IGFs). Impaired β cell function, along with the impact of PDAC-released factors 
(e.g., adrenomedullin (ADM), IGF-1, and macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF) on 
pancreatic islets, may contribute to the induction of diabetes associated with 
PDAC. Recently, exosomes have attracted worldwide attention due to their role in 
varied features of cell function, particularly in cancer progression. Exosomes 
comprise of small extracellular vesicles produced by almost all cells. These 
vesicles contain a vast array of biomolecules, including proteins and microRNAs. 
Exosomes participate in cancer growth and promote angiogenesis. They promote 
tumorigenesis and metastasis, and are associated with the acquisition of cancer 
cells resistant to chemotherapy. Data have been accumulating recently on the 
role of exosomes in the rapid recognition, prognosis and potential therapy of 
pancreatic cancer.

Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal cancers, primarily due to its 
late diagnosis and limited treatment options. This review examines the 
challenges and potential of using immunotherapy to treat pancreatic cancer, 
highlighting the role of artificial intelligence (AI) as a promising tool to 
enhance early detection and monitor the effectiveness of these therapies. By 
synthesizing recent advancements and identifying gaps in the current research, 
this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of how AI and immunotherapy 
can be integrated to develop more personalized and effective treatment 
strategies. The insights from this review may guide future research efforts and 
contribute to improving patient outcomes in pancreatic cancer management.

Desmoplasia is a hallmark feature of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) 
that contributes significantly to treatment resistance. Approaches to enhance 
drug delivery into fibrotic PDAC tumors continue to be an important unmet need. 
In this study, we have engineered a tumor-colonizing E. coli-based agent that 
expresses both collagenase and hyaluronidase as a strategy to reduce desmoplasia 
and enhance the intratumoral perfusion of anticancer agents. Overall, we 
observed that the tandem expression of both these enzymes by tumor-colonizing E. 
coli resulted in the reduced presence of intratumoral collagen and hyaluronan, 
which likely contributed to the enhanced chemotherapeutic efficacy observed when 
used in combination. These results highlight the importance of combination 
treatments involving the depletion of desmoplastic components in PDAC before or 
during treatment.

Leucine is an essential amino acid that cannot be produced endogenously in the 
human body and therefore needs to be obtained from dietary sources. Leucine 
plays a pivotal role in stimulating muscle protein synthesis, along with 
isoleucine and valine, as the group of branched-chain amino acids, making them 
one of the most popular dietary supplements for athletes and gym-goers. The 
individual effects of leucine, however, have not been fully clarified, as most 
of the studies so far have focused on the grouped effects of branched-chain 
amino acids. In recent years, leucine and its metabolites have been shown to 
stimulate muscle protein synthesis mainly via the mammalian target of the 
rapamycin complex 1 signaling pathway, thereby improving muscle atrophy in 
cancer cachexia. Interestingly, cancer research suggests that leucine may have 
either anti-cancer or pro-tumorigenic effects. In the current manuscript, we aim 
to review leucine's roles in muscle protein synthesis, tumor suppression, and 
tumor progression, specifically summarizing the molecular mechanisms of 
leucine's action. The role of leucine is controversial in hepatocellular 
carcinoma, whereas its pro-tumorigenic effects have been demonstrated in breast 
and pancreatic cancers. In summary, leucine being used as nutritional supplement 
for athletes needs more attention, as its pro-oncogenic effects may have been 
identified by recent studies. Anti-cancer or pro-tumorigenic effects of leucine 
in various cancers should be further investigated to achieve clear conclusions.

Familial pancreatic cancer (FPC) represents a significant yet underexplored area 
in pancreatic cancer research. Basic research efforts are notably limited, and 
when present, they are predominantly centered on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations 
due to the scarcity of other genetic variants associated with FPC, leading to a 
limited understanding of the broader genetic landscape of FPC. This review 
examines the current state of FPC research, focusing on the molecular mechanisms 
driving pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) progression. It highlights the 
role of homologous recombination (HR) and its therapeutic exploitation via 
synthetic lethality with PARP inhibitors in BRCA1/2-deficient tumors. The review 
discusses various pre-clinical models of FPC, including conventional 
two-dimensional (2D) cell lines, patient-derived organoids (PDOs), 
patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), and genetically engineered mouse models 
(GEMMs), as well as new advancements in FPC research.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Large-scale epidemiological studies have established a 
bidirectional association between hypertension and cancer. However, the 
underlying mechanisms explaining this connection remain unclear. In our study, 
we investigated whether serum from patients with hypertension (HT) could enhance 
the aggressiveness of cancer cells in vitro through alterations in endothelial 
cell phenotype.
METHODS: Experiments were performed using EAhy926 endothelial cells and ovarian 
(SKOV-3), colorectal (SW480), pancreatic (PSN-1), breast (MCF-7), and lung 
(A549) cancer cell lines.
RESULTS: This study showed that conditioned medium (CM) produced by EAhy926 
cells, when exposed to serum from patients with untreated hypertension (HT-CM), 
promotes the proliferation, migration, and invasion of every cancer cell line 
tested. In addition, endothelial cells subjected to HT serum promote the 
adhesion of all cancer cell types except PSN-1. An intensified transendothelial 
invasion of cancer cells was accompanied by decreased expression of junctional 
proteins (connexin 43, E-cadherin, occluding, desmoglein) in HT serum-treated 
endothelial cells. Quantitative analysis of the secretome of endothelial cells 
subjected to HT serum showed that they secrete increased amounts of CCL2, CXCL1, 
CXCL8, bFGF, HGF, IL-6, PAI-1, and TGF-β1. Moreover, cancer cells exposed to 
HT-CM display increased mRNA expression for several pro-cancerogenic agents, 
including CXCL8, tPA, and VEGF.
CONCLUSIONS: Our report shows that hypertension may potentiate cancer cell 
aggressiveness by modulating endothelial cell phenotype. Further tests with 
antihypertensive drugs are required to assess whether effective treatment of 
hypertension can mitigate its cancer-promoting potential.

Insulinomas are the most common neoplasms of the endocrine pancreas in dogs, 
leading to persistent hypoglycemia due to inappropriate insulin secretion. The 
standard treatment is surgical resection, but it carries significant risks, 
including pancreatitis and diabetes mellitus. This study investigates the 
efficacy and safety of percutaneous ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation 
(RFA) as an alternative to surgery. A total of 29 dogs diagnosed with insulinoma 
were treated with RFA, targeting both primary pancreatic tumors and metastases 
in regional lymph nodes or the liver. Blood glucose levels and tumor size were 
monitored before and after the procedure. RFA led to a significant increase in 
blood glucose levels and a reduction in tumor size in all patients, with minimal 
postoperative complications. The results suggest that RFA is a feasible and 
effective treatment option for insulinomas in dogs.

(1) Background: The importance of total eosinophil count in peripheral blood 
(EOS) as a type 2 inflammation marker is known to be fundamental in asthma, 
chronic sinusitis, and vasculitis. In cancer, despite their questionable 
antiproliferative effect, their role remains unclear. Our purpose was to 
describe the relationship between baseline blood EOS and overall survival (OS) 
in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients. (2) Methods: We 
retrospectively analyzed data from 137 adult patients who underwent surgical 
treatment for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) between the years 2012 and 
2019. Patients with no recent history of systemic steroid use and without 
intraoperative metastases were included. Patients were categorized into two 
groups based on EOS (≥0.1 G/l and <0.1 G/l). Survival outcomes were analyzed 
using Cox proportional hazards regression models. (3) Results: According to EOS 
and PDAC stage, median OS values were as follows: in stage I-III, EOS ≥ 0.1 G/l 
group: 14.5 months, in stage I-III, EOS < 0.1 G/l group: 8.0 months, in stage 
IV, EOS ≥ 0.1 G/l group: 7.0 months, and in stage IV, EOS < 0.1 G/l group: 5.0 
months. EOS < 0.1 G/l (vs. ≥0.1 G/l) was an independent prognostic factor for OS 
in both the uni- and multivariate Cox regression, respectively (HR = 1.48, p = 
0.035 and HR = 1.57, p = 0.021). (4) Conclusions: Peripheral eosinophilia seems 
to be a potential independent prognostic factor. Further studies are necessary 
to confirm this hypothesis, since our findings suggest that type 2 inflammation 
may be the factor directly or indirectly lengthening the survival of patients 
with PDAC.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN) are heterogeneous 
entities. Despite considerable advancement in the field, almost 50% of patients 
have metastatic disease, when liver transplantation (LT) is one of the possible 
treatments offering a cure in well-selected patients.
METHODS: The present study aims to systematically review all the literature from 
2000 onwards on using LT for patients with NEN-LM, with particular attention to 
the risk factors of death and recurrence.
RESULTS: LT offers 5-year OS ranging from 52 to 74% and 5-year TFS rates ranging 
from 39 to 62%, with even better results published from 2009 onwards. The main 
risk factors for patient deaths are related to unfavorable primary tumor 
pathology, higher liver involvement, and simultaneous LT and primary resection. 
Similarly, recurrence is higher related to poor tumor grade and differentiation, 
and in the case of an older recipient age.
CONCLUSIONS: Applying uniform criteria and a more in-depth understanding of the 
relevant prognostic factors contribute to a better selection of candidates for 
curative LT due to NEN metastases. LT for unresectable or liver-restricted NENs 
has a relevant place in the treatment algorithm and has achieved excellent 
results in recent decades, but more international efforts are needed to further 
improve outcomes.

Background: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma acquired resistance to chemotherapy 
poses a major limitation to patient survival. Despite understanding some 
biological mechanisms of chemoresistance, much about those mechanisms remains to 
be uncovered. Mechanobiology, which studies the physical properties of cells, 
holds promise as a potential target for addressing the challenges of 
chemoresistance in PDAC. Therefore, we, here in an initial step, assessed the 
altered mechanobiology of PDAC cells with acquired chemoresistance to 
gemcitabine and paclitaxel. Methods: Five PDAC cell lines and six stably 
resistant subclones were assessed for force generation on elastic micropillar 
arrays. Those measurements of mechanical phenotype were complemented by 
single-cell motility and invasion in 3D collagen-based matrix assays. Further, 
the nuclear translocation of Yes-associated protein (YAP), as a measure of 
active mechanical status, was compared, and biomarkers of the 
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were evaluated using RT-qPCR. 
Results: The PDAC cells with acquired chemoresistance exert higher traction 
forces than their parental/wild-type (WT) cells. In 2D, single-cell motility was 
altered for all the chemoresistant cells, with a cell-type specific pattern. In 
3D, the spheroids of the chemoresistant PDAC cells were able to invade the 
matrix and remodel collagen more than their WT clones. However, YAP nuclear 
translocation and EMT were not significantly altered in relation to changes in 
other physical parameters. Conclusions: This is the first study to investigate 
and report on the altered mechanobiological features of PDAC cells that have 
acquired chemoresistance. A better understanding of mechanical features could 
help in identifying future targets to overcome chemoresistance in PDAC.

Carcinoid syndrome (CS) is a rare condition associated with neuroendocrine 
tumors (NETs), particularly those originating in the gastrointestinal tract, 
which secrete bioactive substances like serotonin. The management of CS requires 
a multidisciplinary approach due to its complex clinical manifestations, 
including flushing, diarrhea, bronchospasm, and carcinoid heart disease. Optimal 
care involves collaboration between several professional figures like 
oncologists, endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, surgeons, and dietitians. 
Currently, a wide range of treatments are available, focused on both symptom 
control and tumor burden reduction. Somatostatin analogs (SSAs) are the 
first-line therapy for symptom relief. Still, in patients with progressive 
disease or refractory CS, other options include targeted therapies, peptide 
receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), liver-directed therapies, and surgical 
resection, when feasible. Furthermore, management of complications related to 
prolonged serotonin release and malnutrition as a result of exocrine pancreatic 
insufficiency, post-surgical conditions, vitamin deficit, and chronic diarrhea 
often requires early detection to mitigate symptoms and improve the quality of 
life in these patients. The complexity of CS necessitates individualized care 
and continuous coordination among specialists to optimize outcomes and enhance 
patient well-being.

Currently, there is no reliable method of discerning between low-risk and 
high-risk intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs). Operative resection 
is utilized in an effort to resect those lesions with high-grade dysplasia (HGD) 
prior to the development of invasive disease. The current guidelines recommend 
resection for IPMN that involve the main pancreatic duct. Resecting lesions with 
HGD before their progression to invasive disease and the avoidance of resection 
in those patients with low-grade dysplasia is the optimal clinical scenario. 
Therefore, the importance of developing preoperative models able to discern HGD 
in IPMN patients cannot be overstated. Low-risk patients should be managed with 
nonsurgical treatment options (typically MRI surveillance), while high-risk 
patients would undergo resection, hopefully prior to the formation of invasive 
disease. Current research is evolving in multiple directions. First, there is an 
ongoing effort to identify reliable markers for predicting malignant 
transformation of IPMN, mainly focusing on genomic and transcriptomic data from 
blood, tissue, and cystic fluid. Also, multimodal models of combining biomarkers 
with clinical and radiographic data seem promising for providing robust and 
accurate answers of risk levels for IPMN patients.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is one of the most aggressive forms of 
breast cancer, lacking common treatment targets such as estrogen (ER), 
progesterone (PR), and HER2 receptors. This subtype is associated with 
significant heterogeneity, chemoresistance, early recurrence, metastasis, and 
poor patient survival. FOXM1 is a cancer-promoting transcription factor that 
plays a critical role in TNBC and other highly aggressive cancers by driving 
cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance. In TNBC, 
mutations in the TP53 gene-detected in approximately 80% of patients-lead to the 
overexpression of FOXM1, making it a promising therapeutic target. Beyond TNBC, 
FOXM1 is implicated in other solid cancers, such as brain (glioblastoma), lung, 
and pancreatic cancers, and is considered an Achilles' heel of aggressive 
cancers. Despite its potential as a therapeutic target, there are currently no 
FDA-approved FOXM1 inhibitors, and none have advanced to clinical trials. This 
review explores the role of FOXM1 in cancer progression and highlights the 
current status of efforts to develop effective FOXM1 inhibitors.

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a serious malignant tumor with a high mortality rate, 
mainly due to late diagnosis and a lack of effective therapeutic interventions. 
The possibility of recognizing this cancer with reliable biomarkers using 
minimally invasive methods is of great importance for improving early detection, 
prognostic assessment, and targeted treatment methods. In recent years, small 
non-coding RNAs, especially microRNAs, have emerged as promising candidates for 
biomarkers of pancreatic cancer. Despite the methodological and analytical 
limitations of microRNA determination and a lack of available automated and 
standardized tests, a prospective systematic assessment of this new parameter's 
use in the detection of pancreatic cancer is warranted. This review provides 
general information on the diagnostic and prognostic utility of microRNAs, which 
appear to be well-established in many studies. In summary, microRNAs are 
promising non-invasive biomarkers of pancreatic cancer, offering potential 
opportunities for early detection, prognosis, and treatment monitoring. As 
research in this field progresses, microRNAs should become valuable tools in the 
fight against pancreatic cancer.

BACKGROUND: Surgical resection for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) 
entails the excision of the primary tumour and regional lymphadenectomy. This 
traditional strategy is challenged by the high rate of early recurrence, 
suggesting inadequate disease staging. Novel methods of intra-operative staging 
are needed to allow surgical resection to be tailored to the disease's biology.
METHODS: A search of published articles on the PubMed and Embase databases was 
performed using the terms 'pancreas' OR 'pancreatic' AND 'intra-operative 
staging/detection' OR 'guided surgery'. Articles published between January 2000 
and June 2023 were included. Technologies that offered intra-operative staging 
and tailored treatment were curated and summarised in the following integrative 
review.
RESULTS: lymph node (LN) mapping and radioimmunoguided surgery have shown 
promising results but lacked practicality to facilitate real-time 
intra-operative staging for PDAC. Fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) offers high 
contrast and sensitivity, enabling the identification of cancerous tissue and 
positive LNs with improved precision following intravenous administration of a 
fluorescent agent. The unique properties of optical coherence tomography and 
ultrasound elastography lend themselves to be platforms for virtual biopsy 
intra-operatively.
CONCLUSIONS: Accurate intra-operative staging of PDAC, localisation of 
metastatic LNs, and identification of extra-pancreatic disease remain clinically 
unmet needs under current detection methods and staging standards. 
Tumour-specific FGS combined with other diagnostic and therapeutic modalities 
could improve tumour detection and staging in patients with PDAC.

Annexin A2 (ANXA2) is a protein that is involved in many physiological and 
pathological cellular processes. There is compelling evidence that its 
dysregulated expression, be it up- or downregulation, contributes to the 
oncogenesis of various neoplasms, including those of the digestive system. The 
present review summarizes the current knowledge on the role of ANXA2 in the main 
tumors of the digestive system. The clinical significance of ANXA2 is 
primordial, due to its potential use as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker, 
and as a part of therapeutic protocols. Certain preclinical studies have shown 
that inhibiting ANXA2 or disrupting its interactions with key molecules can 
suppress tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis, as well as increase the cancer 
cells' sensitivity to treatment in various cancers. Further research is needed 
to fully elucidate the complex role of ANXA2 in the carcinogenesis of tumors of 
the digestive system, and to translate these findings into clinical applications 
for improved diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.

Glutathione peroxidases (GPxs) are a family of enzymes that play a critical role 
in cellular redox homeostasis through the reduction of lipid hydroperoxides to 
alcohols, using glutathione as a substrate. Among them, GPx4 is particularly of 
interest in the regulation of ferroptosis, a form of iron-dependent programmed 
cell death driven by the accumulation of lipid peroxides in the endoplasmic 
reticulum, mitochondria, and plasma membrane. Ferroptosis has emerged as a 
crucial pathway in the context of cancer, particularly pancreatic cancer, which 
is notoriously resistant to conventional therapies. GPx4 acts as a key inhibitor 
of ferroptosis by detoxifying lipid peroxides, thereby preventing cell death. 
However, this protective mechanism also enables cancer cells to survive under 
oxidative stress, which makes GPx4 a potential druggable target in cancer 
therapy. The inhibition of GPx4 can trigger ferroptosis selectively in cancer 
cells, especially in those that rely heavily on this pathway for survival, such 
as pancreatic cancer cells. Consequently, targeting GPx4 and other GPX family 
members offers a promising therapeutic strategy to sensitize pancreatic cancer 
cells to ferroptosis, potentially overcoming resistance to current treatments 
and improving patient outcomes. Current research is focusing on the development 
of small-molecule inhibitors of GPx4 as potential candidates for pancreatic 
cancer treatment.

BACKGROUND: The effect of differing post-contrast phases on CT body composition 
measurements is not yet known.
METHODS: A fully automated AI-based body composition analysis using DAFS was 
performed on a retrospective cohort of 278 subjects undergoing pre-treatment 
triple-phase CT for pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm. The CT 
contrast phases included noncontrast (NON), arterial (ART), and venous (VEN) 
phases. The software selected a single axial CT image at mid-L3 on each phase 
for body compartment segmentation. The areas (cm2) were calculated for skeletal 
muscle (SM), intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), 
and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT). The mean Hounsfield units of skeletal 
muscle (SMHU) within the segmented regions were calculated. Bland-Altman and Chi 
Square analyses were performed.
RESULTS: SM-NON had a lower percentage of bias [LOA] than SM-ART, -0.7 [-7.6, 
6.2], and SM-VEN, -0.3 [-7.6, 7.0]; VAT-NON had a higher percentage of bias than 
ART, 3.4 [-18.2, 25.0], and VEN, 5.8 [-15.0, 26.6]; and this value was lower for 
SAT-NON than ART, -0.4 [-14.9, 14.2], and VEN, -0.5 [-14.3, 13.4]; and higher 
for IMAT-NON than ART, 5.9 [-17.9, 29.7], and VEN, 9.5 [-17.0, 36.1]. The bias 
in SMHU NON [LOA] was lower than that in ART, -3.8 HU [-9.8, 2.1], and VEN, -7.8 
HU [-14.8, -0.8].
CONCLUSIONS: IV contrast affects the voxel HU of fat and muscle, impacting CT 
analysis of body composition. We noted a relatively smaller bias in the SM, VAT, 
and SAT areas across the contrast phases. However, SMHU and IMAT experienced 
larger bias. During threshold risk stratification for CT-based measurements of 
SMHU and IMAT, the IV contrast phase should be taken into consideration.

Background: Pancreatic cancer is among the malignancies with the poorest 
prognosis, largely due to its aggressive nature and resistance to conventional 
therapies. Case Summary: This report describes the case of a 69-year-old male 
patient with stage IV primary lung adenocarcinoma presenting with high levels of 
programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). Simultaneously, abdominal computed tomography 
(CT) showed a dilated pancreatic duct at the level of the pancreatic head and a 
hypodense lesion in the uncinate process involving the superior mesenteric 
artery. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of the pancreatic lesions was negative. 
After three cycles of chemoimmunotherapy, positron emission tomography-computed 
tomography (PET-CT) showed complete remission of the lung nodules, 
lymphadenopathy, and pleural thickening, as well as a decrease in the size of 
the pancreatic lesion. After another six months, a PET-CT scan showed a focal 
increased uptake in the pancreatic mass in the same location, indicating disease 
progression. A core biopsy of the pancreatic tumor showed atypical spindle cell 
morphology with positive staining for vimentin, characteristic of mesenchymal 
differentiation with no apparent epithelial features. Comprehensive molecular 
profiling through Caris Molecular Intelligence® revealed four genes with 
actionable mutations in the pancreatic tissue, including KRAS (p.G12D) and TP53 
(p.R175H). These molecular findings suggested the diagnoses of sarcomatoid 
carcinoma and conventional pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Primary mesenchymal tumors and neuroendocrine 
neoplasms were excluded because immunohistochemistry was negative for anaplastic 
lymphoma kinase (ALK), smooth muscle actin (SMA), desmin, CD34, signal 
transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6), S100, HMB45, CD117, 
discovered on GIST-1 (DOG1), CD56, progesterone, and synaptophysin. However, 
despite multiple rounds of systemic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and radiation, 
his pancreatic disease rapidly deteriorated and metastasized to the liver and 
bone. Conclusions: Despite multiple lines of treatment, the patient's condition 
worsened and he succumbed to his pancreatic malignancy. This study highlights 
the clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment of rare pancreatic 
cancer, emphasizing the importance of molecular testing and histopathological 
biomarkers in personalizing treatment. It also provides insights into promising 
therapeutic approaches for similar cases with an unusual presentation.

Pancreatic cancer is known for its high invasiveness and metastasis, making 
rapid visualization and precise treatment critical for improving patient 
outcomes. Current diagnostic tools lack abilities to provide rapid and accurate 
tumor localization, particularly for real-time intraoperative guidance. To 
address this gap, the study has developed a novel Förster Resonance Energy 
Transfer (FRET)-mediated dual-ratiometric near-infrared fluorescence 
(NIRF)/photoacoustic (PA) bimodal probe, SiRho-SHD-NTR, specifically designed 
for the fast and accurate navigation of pancreatic tumor resection. The probe, 
due to its excellent binding affinity with nitroreductase (NTR), can rapidly 
reach response saturation. Cellular experiments demonstrate that the probe 
rapidly and efficiently penetrates cancer cells, enhancing the effectiveness of 
PA imaging for preliminary diagnosis and tumor localization, while also enabling 
the rapid visualization of pancreatic tumors through NIRF imaging. Leveraging 
the rapid response characteristics of the probe to NTR, the study achieves 
precise tumor imaging in orthotopic pancreatic cancer mice by spraying the 
probe, within ≈5 min. More importantly, the probe even allows for the fast 
visualization of metastatic tumors and fluorescence-guided surgical resection. 
It is believed that SiRho-SHD-NTR will offer a promising method in the rapid 
visualization of pancreatic cancer and provide a powerful tool for 
imaging-guided tumor surgery, targeting both primary and metastatic tumors.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is known for its poor prognosis and resistance to 
conventional therapies, largely due to the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) 
and aggressive angiogenesis. Effectively targeting these CSCs and associated 
angiogenic pathways is crucial for effective treatment. This study leverages 
single-cell multi-omics to explore a novel therapeutic approach involving 
Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) macrophages engineered to target the c-Met 
protein on pancreatic CSCs.
METHODS: We employed single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze pancreatic cancer 
tissue, identifying c-Met as a key marker of CSCs. CAR macrophages were 
engineered using a lentiviral system to express a c-Met-specific receptor. The 
phagocytic efficiency of these CAR macrophages against pancreatic CSCs was 
assessed in vitro, along with their ability to inhibit angiogenesis. The in vivo 
efficacy of CAR macrophages was evaluated in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer.
RESULTS: CAR macrophages demonstrated high specificity for c-Met + CSCs, 
significantly enhancing phagocytosis and reducing the secretion of angiogenic 
factors such as VEGFA, FGF2, and ANGPT. In vivo, these macrophages significantly 
suppressed tumor growth and angiogenesis, prolonging survival in pancreatic 
cancer-bearing mice.
CONCLUSION: CAR macrophages targeting c-Met represent a promising therapeutic 
strategy for pancreatic cancer, offering targeted elimination of CSCs and 
disruption of tumor angiogenesis. This study highlights the potential of 
single-cell multi-omics in guiding the development of precision immunotherapies.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a highly lethal cancer with 
a poor prognosis, is expected to become the second deadliest cancer in the 
United States by 2030. Despite advancements in treatment modalities, the 
survival rates of patients with PDAC have remained low. Immunotherapy has 
emerged as a promising treatment for various cancers; however, its utilization 
in PDAC has been limited due to various challenges, including resistance 
mechanisms and the advanced stage at which most patients are diagnosed.
METHODS: We analyzed data from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) from 2010 to 
2017, focusing on the impact of race, insurance status, and socioeconomic 
factors among patients with stage IV PDAC using logistic regression analyses.
RESULTS: Among 109,663 patients with stage IV PDAC, 421 (0.38%) received 
immunotherapy. The recipients were younger (median age 63 vs. 68 years, 
p < 0.001) and more likely to be white (87.4% vs. 82.1%). Patients with private 
insurance or Medicare (p < 0.001), and those earning more than $60 k annually 
(51.0% vs. 36.4%, p < 0.001) were more likely to receive immunotherapy. 
Treatment was more likely in academic/research programs than in community cancer 
programs (53.0% vs. 33.4%, p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, Black patients 
had lower odds of receiving immunotherapy than Caucasian patients (OR: 0.74 [95% 
CI: 0.601-0.882], p = 0.019). Higher income was also a significant predictor of 
immunotherapy utilization (highest vs. lowest income quartile: OR, 2.228 [95% 
CI: 1.422-3.491], p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed significant disparities in immunotherapy access 
for stage IV PDAC based on race, socioeconomic status, and geographic location 
in the United States, highlighting the need for intervention to promote 
equitable access to this promising treatment modality.

BACKGROUND: At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, access to "planned" 
surgical care was restricted as the health care system responded to the 
coronavirus. We hypothesized that the pandemic resulted in diagnostic and 
therapeutic delays, leading to stage migration among patients with malignancies 
treated with a Whipple procedure.
METHODS: This study is a retrospective review of adults who underwent surgical 
exploration for a planned pancreaticoduodenectomy for malignancy at St. Joseph's 
Health Centre between March 11, 2019, and March 11, 2021.
RESULTS: We included 180 patients in the study. Baseline characteristics, 
pathologic diagnoses, and perioperative outcomes were similar between the 2 
cohorts. The post-COVID group had longer median wait times from date of consent 
(p < 0.001), and from computed tomography (CT) scan (p < 0.001), to surgery. 
There were increased rates of R1 margin positivity in the post-COVID group (p = 
0.01). We saw an association between higher wait times from consent and the last 
CT scan to the date of operation, and increased rates of R1 margin positivity in 
the first year of the pandemic.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the importance of prioritizing care during a 
pandemic and provided evidence for potential long-term consequences when there 
are delays in surgery for aggressive gastrointestinal malignancies.

CONTEXTE: Au début de la pandémie de COVID-19, l’accès aux soins chirurgicaux « 
planifiés » a été limité alors que la réaction au coronavirus accaparait le 
système de santé. Nous avons émis l’hypothèse que la pandémie a entraîné des 
retards diagnostiques et thérapeutiques, conduisant à une migration des stades 
chez les patientes et patients atteints de cancer qui ont subi une opération de 
Whipple (pancréatoduodénectomie).
MÉTHODES: Cette étude est une revue rétrospective portant sur les adultes qui 
ont subi une exploration chirurgicale en vue d’une pancréatoduodénectomie 
planifiée pour un cancer au St. Joseph’s Health Centre entre le 11 mars 2019 et 
le 11 mars 2021.
RÉSULTATS: Nous avons inclus 180 patientes et patients dans notre étude. Les 
caractéristiques de départ, les diagnostics pathologiques et les résultats 
périopératoires étaient similaires dans les 2 cohortes. Le groupe post-COVID a 
connu des temps d’attente médians plus longs de la date du consentement (p < 
0,001) et de la tomodensitométrie (TDM) (p < 0,001) à la date de l’intervention. 
Le taux de positivité de la marge R1 était plus élevé dans le groupe post-COVID 
(p = 0,01). Nous avons observé une association entre des temps d’attente plus 
longs de la date de consentement et de la dernière TDM à la date de 
l’intervention, et une hausse du taux de positivité de la marge R1 au cours de 
la première année de la pandémie.
CONCLUSION: Cette étude démontre l’importance de donner la priorité aux soins 
pendant une pandémie et fournit des données probantes sur les conséquences 
potentielles à long terme des retards en chirurgie pour les tumeurs 
gastro-intestinales agressives.

BACKGROUND: Lactylation plays an essential role in pancreatic cancer, but the 
precise role of lactylated histone in the diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatic 
cancer remains to be further clarified.
METHODS: Twenty-one patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer were enrolled in 
this study, and the clinicopathologic characteristics were collected. 
Lactylation levels of total proteins and histone H3 Lysine-18 (H3K18) of tissues 
were determined by western blotting and laboratory indicators including serum 
levels of lactate, Cancer Antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), and Carcinoembryogenic Antigen 
(CEA) were obtained.
RESULTS: Total protein lactylation was found in both pancreatic cancer tissues 
and para-carcinoma normal tissues, and was more potent in tumor tissues. H3K18la 
was also highly expressed tumor tissues. Furthermore, H3K18la protein expression 
correlated positively with serum lactate (r = 0.774, p < 0.001), CA19-9 (r = 
0.744, p < 0.001), and CEA (r = 0.589, p < 0.01). The Area Under the Curve (AUC) 
of H3K18la for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer was 0.848 in serum (p < 
0.001).
CONCLUSION: The present findings suggested that H3K18 may be used as a novel 
potential biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatic cancer 
patients.

Novel Therapies for Pancreatic Cancer.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) unfortunately remains a highly fatal disease 
with a 5-year survival rate of only 11%. If surgical resection is not possible, 
systemic chemotherapy represents the standard-of-care approach to management. 
Combination chemotherapy regimens using fluorouracil (fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, 
leucovorin, and irinotecan; and fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) or 
gemcitabine with albumin-bound paclitaxel have the potential to improve overall 
survival for patients with advanced disease. With the increasing understanding 
of the molecular drivers of pancreatic cancer, novel therapeutic approaches have 
made incremental progress for these patients. The molecular landscape of PDAC 
has been studied extensively. Approximately 90% of PDACs harbor mutations in the 
KRAS gene, a driver mutation that has long been considered undruggable. However, 
novel KRAS inhibitors have shown therapeutic promise in early-phase clinical 
trials, with larger studies ongoing. Less frequently encountered genomic 
aberrations that have therapeutic potential include NRG, BRAF, NTRK, HER2, BRCA, 
PALB2, and claudin. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have unfortunately yielded 
disappointing efficacy for the majority of patients with pancreatic cancer, 
except for those with tumors exhibiting deficiency in mismatch repair proteins. 
Alternative approaches to incorporate immunotherapy have shown more promise such 
as use of immune checkpoint inhibitors for selected patients in the maintenance 
setting and potential vaccine therapies in the postsurgery adjuvant setting. It 
is vital to perform molecular profiling in all patients with PDAC to identify 
potential treatment targets, and to enroll patients in clinical trials whenever 
possible.

Enhancing Pancreatic Cancer Therapy with Targeted CD133-Exosome Delivery of 
PD-L1 siRNA: A Preclinical Investigation.

Yoon YC, Lee D, Park JH, Kim OH, Choi HJ, Kim SJ.

OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the anticancer potential of genetically modified 
exosomes engineered to express CD133-binding peptides on their surface and carry 
PD-L1 siRNA for the treatment of murine model of metastatic pancreatic cancer.
METHODS: CD133-targeting exosomes (tEx) were generated by harvesting conditioned 
media from adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) that had undergone transformation 
using pDisplay vectors encoding CD133-binding peptide sequences. Subsequently, 
siPD-L1-loaded CD133-targeting Exosomes, referred to as tEx(s), were created by 
incorporating PD-L1 siRNA into the tEx using Exofect kit.
RESULTS: tEx(s) demonstrated superior targetability compared to other materials, 
including Ex, Ex(p), and tEx. This was substantiated by higher Total Radiant 
Efficiency (TRE) observed in metastatic liver and pancreatic tissues following 
intravenous administration of tEx(s) (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the intravenous 
delivery of tEx(s) resulted in the most pronounced upregulation of pro-apoptotic 
markers (BIM and c-caspase 3) and the least downregulation of the anti-apoptotic 
markers (Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL) which has been demonstrated in various methods, 
including RT-PCR, Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry in the 
metastatic lesions in the livers (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: PD-L1 siRNA-loaded CD133-targeting exosomes demonstrated remarkable 
anticancer efficacy, characterized by specific binding to CD133-positive 
pancreatic cancer cells and suppression of PD-L1 expression within these cells.

Exploration of the Dual Role of Dectin-1 in Tumor Development and Its 
Therapeutic Potential.

Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.

Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors like PD-1, PD-L1, and 
CTLA-4, has revolutionized cancer treatment. However, the role of the innate 
immune system, especially pattern recognition receptors, in cancer development 
and immunity is gaining more and more attention. Dectin-1, a C-type lectin 
receptor primarily involved in antifungal immunity, has emerged as a significant 
player in cancer biology, exhibiting both pro-tumor and anti-tumor roles. This 
dual function largely depends on the tumor type and microenvironment. Dectin-1 
can promote immune responses against tumors like melanoma and breast cancer by 
enhancing both innate and adaptive immunity. However, in tumors like pancreatic 
ductal adenocarcinoma and colorectal cancer, Dectin-1 activation suppresses T 
cell immunity, facilitating tumor progression. This review explores the complex 
mechanisms by which Dectin-1 modulates the tumor microenvironment and discusses 
its potential as a therapeutic target for cancer treatment.

A Review of Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy in the Management of Gastrointestinal 
Malignancies.

Hollis E(1), Nganga DW(1), Yanagihara TK.

Author information:
(1)From the Department of Radiation Oncology, University of North Carolina.

In this review, we explore the role of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and 
other advanced radiotherapy techniques in the treatment of gastrointestinal 
malignancies, which primarily involves primary and secondary liver cancers and 
pancreatic cancers. The review examines radiotherapy in both curative and 
palliative settings, emphasizing the evolution of SBRT and hypofractionation as 
alternatives to conventional radiotherapy. We review the recent literature 
evaluating radiotherapy in the management of unresectable, borderline 
resectable, and metastatic pancreatic cancer, highlighting recent advances in 
radiotherapy techniques that aim to improve local control, reduce toxicity, and 
increase resectability in appropriate patients. For primary liver cancers 
(hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma), SBRT has emerged as a 
potential noninvasive alternative to surgery, particularly in patients with 
unresectable tumors or those awaiting liver transplantation. The review also 
provides insights into ongoing clinical trials, comparative studies between SBRT 
and other local therapies such as radiofrequency ablation, and the use of 
radiotherapy in managing liver metastases from various primary cancers. 
Throughout, we emphasize limitations in the available literature and highlight 
areas of ongoing and future investigation.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to report the long-term outcomes after surgical 
resection for invasive (I) intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) and to 
define prognostic factors for survival.
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated all consecutive pancreatic resections 
performed IPMN between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2022. Multivariate Cox 
analysis identified risk factors for survival.
RESULTS: Surgery for IPMN was performed in 125 patients including 78 I-IPMN 
(62%). Ninety-day mortality rates was 1.6% (n = 2) with an overall morbidity 
rate of 44.4%. I-IPMN showed higher serum CA 19 - 9 serum values (p < 0.0001), 
more frequently jaundice (p = 0.008), more high-risk stigmata (p = 0.002) and 
diffuse IPMN form (p = 0.005) compared with non-invasive IPMN. The median 
overall survival for I-IPMN was 178.36 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 
87.01-NR) with overall survival rates at one, three, five, and 10 years of 91%, 
75%, 72%, and 62%, respectively. Jaundice (hazard ratio [HR]: 4.23; 95% CI: 
1.48-12.07; p = 0.006), T3 lesions (HR: 3.24; 95% CI: 1.65-6.39; p = 0.006), 
absence of lymph node involvement (HR: 0.15; 95% CI: 0.04-0.60; p = 0.0007), R1 
margin status (HR: 2.96;95%CI:1.08-8:15;p = 0.03) and need for venous resection 
(HR: 4.30; 95% CI: 1.26-14.6; p = 0.006) were identified as independent risk 
factors for survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survival and cure can be observed after surgical 
resection of pancreatic adenocarcinomas originating from I-IPMN when resected at 
early stage (Tis, T1, T2). I-IPMN spreading beyond pancreatic ducts (jaundice, 
T3 lesions, lymph nodes, Veins) have limited long-term survival.

BACKGROUND: Early screening of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is strongly 
recommended for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected patients. We aimed to develop 
and validate a predictive nomogram based on HCC occurrence trajectory for 
screening precancerous patients with HCC.
METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) samples from 22 patients with 
HCC with their precancerous stage (n = 55) and 18 healthy controls were measured 
using HumanMethylation EPIC BeadChip assay. HCC trajectory was assessed by 
pseudotime based on TimeAx algorithm and chronological time. The 43 candidate 
CpG sites were selected from the methylation signature and measured using 
multiplex bisulfite sequencing in a retrospective cohort of HBV-infected 
patients (n = 604). A 5-CpG-classifier was built using the LASSO Cox regression 
model, based on the association between the methylation level of every CpG and 
the duration from enrollment to HCC occurrence of individual patient. We 
validated the risk stratification and predictive accuracy of this classifier in 
both the primary cohort (n = 300) and independent validation cohort (n = 304).
RESULTS: Pseudotime and chronological time of HCC trajectory analysis revealed 
that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway underwent changes in the precancerous stage. Based 
on the trajectory of methylation signature, we built a 5-CpG-classifier which 
remained powerful and independent predictive efficiency after stratified 
analysis by clinicopathological risk factors in both primary cohort and 
independent validation cohort. A predicting nomogram including the 
5-CpG-classifier was constructed after multivariate analysis. One-year 
cumulative hazard of HCC in low- and high-risk groups of HBV-infected patients 
was 3.0% (0.1%-5.8%) and 17.90% (11.00%-24.3%) (P < .0001) in primary cohort, 
4.5% (1.20%-7.80%) and 27.3 (18.90-34.90) (P < .0001) in the independent 
validation cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: One-year before HCC was a critical period of transitional time when 
parts of the methylation profile underwent shifting toward HCC like. The 
nomogram could identify precancerous stage patients with HCC who should be 
screened for early diagnosis and intervention.

The phosphorylation of histone H2A.X into γH2A.X is a crucial early event in the 
DNA damage response, marking DNA damage sites and initiating repair processes. 
While ATM kinase is traditionally recognized as the primary mediator of H2A.X 
phosphorylation, our study identifies serine/threonine kinase 39 (STK39) as a 
novel enhancer of this critical signaling pathway. We demonstrate that after DNA 
damage, STK39 undergoes phosphorylation by the ATM kinase, facilitating its 
interaction with the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex and subsequent recruitment to 
chromatin. This recruitment enables STK39 to further phosphorylate H2A.X, thus 
amplifying γH2A.X production and promoting homologous recombination repair. 
Notably, we observe a significant upregulation of STK39 in pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma (PAAD) tissues, correlating with heightened resistance to PARPi 
therapy. Furthermore, we demonstrate the synergistic efficacy of combining STK39 
inhibition with PARP inhibitors in suppressing and reversing PAAD growth. This 
study not only provides new insights into the molecular dynamics of H2A.X 
phosphorylation but also highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting STK39 
to enhance PARPi sensitivity in PAAD (created with BioRender).

OBJECTIVE: Developing nomogram-based risk stratification model to determine 
3-year and 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) and to identify high-risk 
patients with gastric adenocarcinoma based on different Rictor statuses.
METHODS: 1366 individuals who underwent radical gastric surgery to treat gastric 
adenocarcinoma at Shanxi Cancer Hospital from May 2002 to December 2020 were 
analyzed. Cox regression analysis was employed to create the nomograms. The 
nomograms' performance was assessed using C-index, time receiver operating 
characteristic (t-ROC) curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis 
(DCA) curves in training and validation cohorts. Subsequently, patients were 
categorized into high-risk and low-risk groups based on the nomogram's risk 
scores.
RESULTS: The Rictor (-) nomogram for predicting PFS included variables such as 
age, number of positive lymph nodes, vascular invasion, maximum diameter of the 
tumor, omentum metastasis, and expression of MSH2. In the internal validation, 
the C-index of the Rictor (-) nomogram was 0.760 (95%CI: 0.720-0.799), which was 
superior to the C-index of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th 
edition TNM staging (0.683, 95%CI: 0.646-0.721). Similarly, the Rictor (+) 
nomogram for predicting PFS included variables such as gender, age, pT stage, 
number of positive lymph nodes, neural invasion, maximum diameter of the tumor, 
omentum metastasis, Clavien-Dindo classification for complications, and CGA 
expression. The C-index of the Rictor (+) nomogram was 0.795 (95%CI: 
0.764-0.825), which outperformed the C-index of the AJCC 8th edition TNM staging 
(0.693, 95%CI: 0.662-0.723). The calibration curves, t-ROC curves, and decision 
curve analysis for both nomogram models demonstrated their excellent prediction 
ability.
CONCLUSION: This study presents the first risk stratification for Rictor status 
in gastric adenocarcinoma. Our model identifies low-risk patients who may not 
require additional postoperative treatment, while high-risk patients should 
consider targeted therapies that specifically target Rictor-positive indicators.

The clinical significance of FOLFOXIRI (5-FU, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and 
irinotecan) plus anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody using cetuximab for metastatic 
colorectal cancer (mCRC) remains controversial. We report results from a 
randomized phase 2 DEEPER trial (UMIN000018217, jRCTs061180022) to test the 
superiority of modified (m)-FOLFOXIRI plus weekly cetuximab over bevacizumab in 
patients with RAS wild-type (wt) mCRC. Primary endpoint was depth of response 
(DpR). Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), early tumor 
shrinkage (ETS) at week 8, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival 
(OS), time to tumor growth (TTG), time to treatment failure (TTF), association 
between tumor shrinkage and prognosis, association between TTG and prognosis, R0 
resection rate, and safety. In 359 enrolled patients with RAS wt mCRC, median 
DpR was significantly better in cetuximab (57.3% vs 46.0%, p = 0.0029); however, 
ORR, ETS, R0 resection rate, TTG, TTF, PFS and OS were similar between 2 
treatments. There was a weak association between DpR and survival time in both 
treatments. The correlation between TTG and OS was slightly stronger in 
cetuximab. The post-hoc exploratory analysis showed that cetuximab produced 
greater PFS (15.3 vs 11.7 months; HR 0.68) and OS (53.6 vs 40.2 months; HR 0.54) 
in patients with left-sided and RAS/BRAF wt tumors. m-FOLFOXIRI plus cetuximab 
has clinical benefit for tumor shrinkage in RAS wt mCRC. The survival benefit 
for RAS/BRAF wt and left-sided mCRC needs further investigation.

PURPOSE: Alkylating agents (ALKY) are the main chemotherapies used for advanced 
neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). O6-Methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) 
status, as proficient (p) or deficient (d), may predict the response to ALKY.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: MGMT-NET (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03217097) was 
a phase II trial randomly assigning 1:1 for pMGMT or 2:1 for dMGMT-NETs to 
either ALKY or oxaliplatin (Ox). Inclusion criteria were a confirmed advanced 
pancreatic, thoracic, or unknown primary NETs with an indication for 
chemotherapy and tissue available. The primary aim was to detect a difference of 
35% between the 3-month objective response rate (ORR) in pMGMT-NETs versus in 
dMGMT-NETs when treated with ALKY. A biomarker-stratified design was performed 
to compare ALKY and Ox in the dMGMT and pMGMT strata for the secondary end 
points. dMGMT was defined using pyrosequencing (PSQ; methylated MGMT ≥9%) and 
using immunochemistry (H-score of MGMT <50) when PSQ was not interpretable.
RESULTS: From October 2018 to October 2021, 105 patients (55 pancreas, 38 
thorax, 12 unknown) started either ALKY (n = 62) or Ox (n = 43). The median age 
was 63 years (range, 30-84), and 59% were males. NETs were G1 (19%), G2 (69%), 
or G3 (10%). Among patients with interpretable MGMT status, 56.9% (58 of 102) 
had a dMGMT-NET. The primary end point was not reached; the 3-month ORR was 10 
(29.4%) versus 2 (8%), and the odds ratio was 3.5 (0.58-21.16), P = .172. 
However, best ORR (18 [52.9%] v 3 [11.5%]) and median progression-free survival 
(14.6 [95% CI, 7.2 to 22.1] v 11.3 [9.4 to 13.2] months) were higher for 
dMGMT-NETs versus pMGMT-NETs. MGMT status does not seem to affect the Ox 
efficacy.
CONCLUSION: Despite the fact that the primary end point was not reached, ALKY 
has clinical activity in patients with dMGMT-NETs.

Maximizing drug cargo carrying capacity in blood circulation, controlling the in 
vivo fate of nanoparticles, and precisely drug release to tumor targets are the 
main aims of multifunctional nanomedicine-based antitumor therapy. Here we 
combined macrocyclic polyamine di(triazole-[12]aneN3) (M) and chemical drug 
camptothecin (CPT, C) through photosensitizer 
1,1-dicyano-2-phenyl-2-(4-diphenylamino) phenyl-ethylene (DT) containing the 
cleavable disulfide (S) linkage as an all-in-one theranostic nanoprodrug, MDTSC. 
The corresponding compound with carbon chain (C) linkage, MDTCC, was also 
prepared for a comparison study. MDTSC showed the ability to carry plasmids, 
including the p53 tumor suppressor gene, to form lipoplexes with a size of ∼150 
nm. Further addition of DOPE-PEG2k resulted in the hybrid lipoplexes 
MDTSC/DOPE-PEG2k@DNA, which showed good stability in blood circulation and good 
biocompatibility to normal cell lines. Experiments demonstrated that the hybrid 
lipoplexes were able to realize the successful cellular uptake and endosomal 
escape, to generate ROS under visible light irradiation as well as to trigger 
the localized release of CPT and the plasmid encoding p53 in tumor cells. In 
vitro, the hybrid lipoplexes showed better EGFP expression than the commercial 
Lipo2000, and markedly reduced tumor cell proliferation and migration rate 
irrespective of whether the BxPC-3 cell lines were grown on plates or 3D tumor 
spheroids. In vivo, the hybrid lipoplexes showed effective anticancer activity 
by reducing the BxPC-3 pancreatic tumor growth by 99% through the synergetic 
combination of chemotherapy, photodynamic therapy, and gene therapy. This 
research represented the first example of using a cocktail of three therapeutic 
approaches to achieve cooperative and effective anti pancreatic cancer treatment 
in vivo and in vitro.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has proven to be a formidable cancer 
primarily due to its tumor microenvironment (TME). This highly desmoplastic, 
hypoxic, and pro-inflammatory environment has not only been shown to facilitate 
the growth and metastasis of PDAC but has also displayed powerful 
immunosuppressive capabilities. A critical cell involved in the development of 
the PDAC TME is the fibroblast, specifically the antigen-presenting 
cancer-associated fibroblast (apCAF). The pro-inflammatory environment of PDAC 
induces the proliferation of apCAFs, promoting immunosuppression through immune 
cell inactivation, immune response regulation, and expression of CD74. In 
conjunction with apCAFs and tumor cells, CD74 serves as a versatile promoter of 
PDAC by preventing tumor antigen-expression on tumor cells, upregulating the 
expression of immunosuppressive chemical mediators, and activating proliferative 
pathways to induce PDAC malignancy. This review will highlight critical 
mediators and pathways that promote the PDAC stroma and TME with its hypoxic and 
immunosuppressive properties. Further, we will highlight the nature of apCAFs 
and CD74, their specific roles in the PDAC TME, and their potential as targets 
for immunotherapy.

While pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PA) incidence is increasing, especially in 
France, the association between pesticides and PA remains unclear. The aims of 
this study were to assess the spatiotemporal distribution of the incidence of PA 
in France between 2011 and 2021 and to determine whether pesticide exposure was 
associated with higher risk of PA. We employed a disease-mapping and ecological 
regression approach with medicoadministrative data covering 99% of the French 
population. Exposure data were drawn from an open purchase database. A pesticide 
exposure intensity index (PEXI), defined as the logged and scaled median of the 
ratio quantity of substance over agricultural surface per spatial unit was used 
for total quantity (total PEXI) and 9 specific substances. The analyses were 
adjusted for tobacco-induced diseases, deprivation, community medicine 
accessibility, alcohol-related disease and morbid obesity. A Bayesian 
hierarchical spatiotemporal model was used to both model the incidence over time 
and space, and to estimate the risk of PA for pesticide use. We identified 
134 102 incident cases of PA between 2011 and 2021. The relative risk of PA was 
heterogeneous across space with greater risk around Paris, central France and 
the Mediterranean coast. We observed an association, albeit small, between the 
total PEXI and PA incidence over the study period (RR: 1.0130; CI95% 
[1.0057;1.0204]). Sulphur for spraying, mancozeb, and glyphosate showedevidence 
of an association of the same magnitude. These findings show that new cases of 
PA occur heterogeneously in space, raising questions about our understanding of 
PA environmental risk factors. The association with pesticide exposure should be 
confirmed and underlying mechanisms understood using individual-level studies.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal 
malignancies, characterized by its aggressive progression and dismal prognosis. 
Advances in epigenetic profiling, specifically DNA methylation analysis, have 
significantly deepened our understanding of PDAC pathogenesis. This review 
synthesizes findings from recent genome-wide DNA methylation studies, which have 
delineated a complex DNA methylation landscape differentiating between normal 
and cancerous pancreatic tissues, as well as across various stages and molecular 
subtypes of PDAC. These studies identified specific differentially methylated 
regions (DMRs) that not only enhance our grasp of the epigenetic drivers of PDAC 
but also offer potential biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis, enabling 
the customization of therapeutic approaches. The review further explores how DNA 
methylation profiling could facilitate the development of subtype-tailored 
therapies, potentially improving treatment outcomes based on precise molecular 
characterizations. Overall, leveraging DNA methylation alterations as functional 
biomarkers holds promise for advancing our understanding of disease progression 
and refining PDAC management strategies, which could lead to improved patient 
outcomes and a deeper comprehension of the disease's underlying biological 
mechanisms.

Locally advanced tumors of the stomach, colon and hepatopancreatobiliary zone 
comprise more than 20% of all cancers. Treatment of these patients is difficult, 
since tumors have complications in more than 70% of cases. Appropriate treatment 
poses difficulties due to functional state of these patients. Despite the 
success of drug therapy, multivisceral R0 resections including 
pancreaticoduodenectomy for locally advanced tumors of the stomach, right half 
of the colon and hepatopancreatobiliary organs, are the only way to improve 
survival of such patients. This review is devoted to the largest studies of 
multivisceral resections, including pancreaticoduodenectomy for locally advanced 
cancer of the stomach, right half of the colon and hepatopancreatobiliary 
tumors. The immediate and long-term results of treatment, as well as prognostic 
factors of survival are presented. Currently, all available articles are 
presented by case reports or series of cases. Meta-analysis of several 
retrospective studies is rare. The indications for such extensive surgical 
interventions are not defined. Prospective and randomized studies are almost 
impossible due to extremely heterogeneous groups.

Publisher: В структуре всех локализаций рака частота местнораспространенных 
опухолей желудка, толстой кишки и гепатопанкреатобилиарной зоны превышает 20%. 
Лечение данных пациентов вызывает трудности, т. к. более чем в 70% случаев 
впервые установленного диагноза опухоли имеют осложненное течение. Сложности в 
лечении также связаны с функциональным состоянием больных, у части из которых 
помимо осложненного течения заболевания проведена высокотоксичная многокурсовая 
химиотерапия. Несмотря на успехи лекарственного лечения, мультивисцеральные 
операции R0, включающие панкреатодуоденальную резекцию по поводу 
местнораспространенных опухолей желудка, правой половины ободочной кишки и 
органов гепатобилиопанкреатодуоденальной зоны, являются единственной 
возможностью улучшить выживаемость таких больных. В данной работе отражен анализ 
наиболее крупных исследований роли мультивисцеральных операций, включающих 
панкреатодуоденальную резекцию, при местнораспространенном раке желудка, правой 
половины ободочной кишки, и опухолей органов гепатобилиопанкреатодоуденальной 
зоны. Приведены ближайшие, отдаленные результаты лечения и прогностические 
факторы выживаемости. В настоящее время все немногочисленные публикации по этой 
теме представляют собой описания отдельных наблюдений или серий наблюдений и 
редко — метаанализы нескольких ретроспективных исследований. Показания к таким 
обширным оперативным вмешательствам не определены. Из-за крайне выраженной

Lung diseases are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates, thereby 
jeopardizing human health and imposing a great burden on society. Currently, 
lung diseases are mainly treated with medications, oxygen therapy and mechanical 
ventilation, but these approaches are unable to effectively reduce the mortality 
rate. Therefore, lung transplantation remains the ultimate treatment for various 
chronic lung diseases, but this treatment is also hindered by the limited 
availability of lung sources, immature technology and a low survival rate after 
transplantation. With constant changes in the environment, pathogens, type and 
amount of harmful substances and the prevalence of respiratory diseases, there 
is an urgent need to identify alternative treatment methods. Research on stem 
cell therapy has been very successful in recent years, and mesenchymal stem 
cells (MSCs), together with their secretory bodies, play a significant 
therapeutic role. Extracellular vesicles of MSCs (MSC-EVs) are also major 
components of the paracrine secretion of MSCs, including exosomes, 
microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies, among which exosomes are the most typical. 
MSC-EVs are believed to be present in various tissues of the human body where 
they can carry proteins, DNA, RNA and biologically active factors, just to name 
a few. They can also transmit various biological signals to participate in 
different biological activities, including the maintenance of homeostasis within 
the tissue. Several studies have further demonstrated that MSCs and their 
generated extracellular vesicles play an important role in the treatment of 
diseases. In this paper, the origin, properties and roles of MSCs and MSC-EVs 
are reviewed, the mechanisms of different lung diseases, the limitations of 
current therapeutic options and the roles of MSC-EVs in Chronic Obstructive 
Pulmonary Disease, asthma, infectious lung disease, lung cancer, pulmonary 
fibrosis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and acute lung injury/ acute 
respiratory distress syndrome are also discussed (Figure 1). In addition, the 
current limitations and possible future research directions are also discussed 
in view of providing new ideas for the role of MSC-EVs in the treatment of lung 
diseases.

Liver cancer, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), poses a significant 
global health challenge due to its high mortality rate. Hepatocellular carcinoma 
and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) are the two main types of primary 
liver cancer (PLC), each with its own set of complexities. Secondary or 
metastatic liver cancer is more common than PLC. It is frequently observed in 
malignancies such as colorectal, pancreatic, melanoma, lung, and breast cancer. 
Liver cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, making it difficult to 
treat. This highlights the need for focused research on early detection and 
effective treatment strategies. This review explores the epidemiology, risk 
factors, and diagnostic techniques for HCC. The development of HCC involves 
various risk factors, including chronic liver diseases, hepatitis B and C 
infections, alcohol consumption, obesity, smoking, and genetic predispositions. 
Various invasive and non-invasive diagnostic techniques, such as biopsy, liquid 
biopsy, and imaging modalities like ultrasonography, computed tomography scans 
(CT scans), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography 
(PET) scans, are utilized for HCC detection and monitoring. Advances in imaging 
technology and biomarker research have led to more accurate and sensitive 
methods for early HCC detection. We also reviewed advanced research on emerging 
techniques, including next-generation sequencing, metabolomics, epigenetic 
biomarkers, and microbiome analysis, which show great potential for advancing 
early diagnosis and personalized treatment strategies. This literature review 
provides insights into the current state of liver cancer diagnosis and promising 
future advancements. Ongoing research and innovation in these areas are 
essential for improving early diagnosis and reducing the global burden of liver 
cancer.

Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a rare but fatal cancer that occurs primarily 
in young people. There are currently no known effective treatments, although 
several promising treatments appear to be in development. Genetic studies have 
confirmed that almost all FLC tumors have a fusion protein marker 
(DNAJB1-PRKACA) encoded by a fusion gene (DNAJB1-PRKACA); It is currently 
accepted as a diagnostic criterion for FLCs. Several research teams have 
established patient-derived xenograft (PDX) FLC models using immunocompromised 
animals as hosts and patient tissue samples (tumors or ascites) as primary 
sources for PDX-derived organoids. These FLC organoids are composed of FLC 
epithelia, endothelial progenitor cells, and stellate cells. CRISPR/Cas9 was 
used as a gene editing technique to modify mature hepatocytes to obtain ex vivo 
FLC-like cells expressing the fusion gene and/or other mutated genes associated 
with FLCs. Although these models simulate some but not all FLC features. Drug 
screening using these models has not proven effective in identifying clinically 
useful treatments. Genetic studies comparing FLCs to normal maturing endodermal 
cell lineages have shown that FLCs share genetic signatures not with 
hepatocytes, but with subpopulations of biliary tree stem cells (BTSCs), 
hepato/pancreatic stem/progenitor cells that consistently reside in peribiliary 
glands (PBGs) located in the biliary tree and are sources of stem cells for the 
formation and postnatal regeneration of the liver and pancreas. Therefore, it is 
expected that models of BTSCs, instead of hepatocytes may prove more useful. In 
this review, we summarize the status of the various FLC models and their 
features, applications, and limitations. They provide opportunities to 
understand the cause and characteristics of this deadly disease and are models 
from which effective treatments can be identified.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is a highly malignant tumor with a rapid 
progression rate and a high susceptibility to infiltration and metastasis. 
Astragalus polysaccharide (APS), a pure Chinese medicine preparation primarily 
made from the traditional Chinese herb Astragalus, plays a positive role in the 
treatment of many malignant tumors.
AIM: To explore the recent efficacy of APS combined with gemcitabine plus 
tegafur gimeracil oteracil potassium capsule (S-1) (GS) regimen in the treatment 
of pancreatic cancer and assess its effect on the immune function and long-term 
survival of patients.
METHODS: A total of 97 patients who were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and 
received GS chemotherapy at The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese 
Medical University (Zhejiang Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine) from March 
2021 to December 2021 were included in the retrospective analysis. Among them, 
41 patients received APS combined with GS chemotherapy, and 56 patients received 
GS chemotherapy only. The recent efficacy, immune function, adverse reactions, 
and long-term survival were compared among these patients.
RESULTS: After 4 cycles of treatment, the objective response rate of patients 
receiving the combined therapy of APS and GS was 51.22%, and the disease control 
rate (DCR) was 56.10%, higher than those of patients receiving the monotherapy 
with GS alone (30.36% and 35.71%, respectively). Besides, the percentages of 
CD3+ T cells (50.18% ± 9.57%) and CD4+ T cells (31.52% ± 5.33%) in the 
peripheral blood of patients receiving the combined therapy of APS and GS were 
higher compared with those treated with GS regimen alone [(44.06% ± 8.55%) and 
(26.01% ± 7.83%), respectively]. Additionally, the incidences of leukopenia, 
thrombocytopenia, and fatigue in patients receiving the combined therapy of APS 
and GS were significantly lower than those in patients receiving the monotherapy 
of GS alone (17.07%, 9.76%, 31.71% vs 37.50%, 28.57%, 60.71%). Moreover, the 
median survival time of patients receiving the combined therapy of APS and GS 
was 394 days, significantly longer than that of patients receiving the 
monotherapy of GS alone (339 days) (hazard ratio: 0.66; 95%CI: 0.45-0.99; P = 
0.036). All these differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The combined therapy of APS and GS improved the recent efficacy and 
long-term survival of patients with pancreatic cancer and alleviated 
chemotherapy-induced immune suppression and adverse reactions.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to compare mean platelet volume/platelet count 
ratio (PVPR) and other indicators' predictive abilities. Simultaneously, a new 
nomogram for predicting recurrence-free survival (RFS) after gastrointestinal 
stromal tumors (GISTs) R0 resection was developed.
METHODS: From January 2010 to July 2019, 295 patients with GIST who were 
operated on at Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital were retrospectively 
reviewed. With a 4-year RFS as the end point, using the Kaplan-Meier methods and 
log rank test, and then conducting Cox regression analysis, we compared and 
identified meaningful indicators for predicting prognosis. Finally, a nomogram 
was developed and validated using calibration curves.
RESULTS: The receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that a cutoff 
point of 0.044 was the ideal threshold for PVPR, and patients were divided into 
a high-PVPR group (≤0.044) and a low-PVPR group (>0.044). Kaplan-Meier curves 
suggested that PVPR>0.044 had obvious associations with better RFS (p < 0.001). 
In accordance with multivariate analysis, PVPR (>0.044 vs. ≤0.044) (p = 0.005), 
National Institutes of Health (NIH) risk category (p < 0.001), and Ki-67 (p = 
0.005) were the independent prognostic indicators of RFS. Tumor size, 
gastrointestinal bleeding, mitotic index, NIH risk category, CD34, and Ki-67 all 
exhibited an obvious correlation with PVPR (all p < 0.05). The nomogram's 
probability of concordance was 0.823, indicating that the nomogram predictions 
were well calibrated.
CONCLUSION: In GISTs, RFS can be independently predicted by PVPR. Patients with 
higher PVPR have better RFS. The nomogram including PVPR could be used to assist 
clinical treatment decision-making.

BACKGROUND: Knowledge of determinants of aggressive end-of-life care is crucial 
to organizing effective palliative care for patients with gastrointestinal (GI) 
cancer.
PURPOSE: This study aims to investigate the determinants of aggressive 
end-of-life care in patients with GI cancer.
METHODS: A national register-based cohort study using data from the Danish 
Register on Causes of Death, the Danish National Patient Register, and the 
Danish Palliative Database was the method of study employed.
PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: All Danish patients who died from GI cancers from 2010 to 
2020 comprised the study setting.
RESULTS: There were 43,969 patients with GI cancers in the cohort, of whom 62% 
were hospitalized in the last 30 days of life, 41% of patients died in the 
hospital, 10% had surgery, 39% were subjected to a radiological examination 
during the last 30 days of life and 3% had antineoplastic treatment during the 
last 14 days of life. Among all types of GI cancers, pancreatic cancer was 
significantly associated with all outcomes of aggressive end-of-life care except 
surgery. Patients in specialized palliative care (SPC) had lower odds of 
receiving aggressive end-of-life care and dying in the hospital. We found that 
patients with comorbidity and those who were divorced had higher odds of being 
hospitalized at the end of life and dying in the hospital.
INTERPRETATION: Aggressive end-of-life care is associated with disease factors 
and socio-demographics. The potential to reduce aggressive end-of-life care is 
considerable in patients with GI cancer, as demonstrated by the impact of SPC. 
However, we need to address the needs of patients with GI cancer who do not 
receive SPC.

Advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a dismal prognosis. 
Immunotherapy alone offers limited efficacy, but it is still unknown whether its 
combination with chemotherapy could offer synergistic anti-tumor effects. This 
phase Ib/II study evaluated the safety and efficacy of combining toripalimab 
with the gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel (GnP) regimen as first-line treatment 
for locally advanced or metastatic PDAC and explored predictive biomarkers 
(ChiCTR2000032293). The primary endpoints were safety and overall survival (OS). 
The secondary outcomes were objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate 
(DCR), and progression-free survival (PFS). Immune-related biomarkers including 
programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, genetic status, cytokine levels, 
and spatial features of the tumor immune microenviroment (TIME) were 
investigated. Neither serious treatment-related adverse events nor grade 4 
immune-related adverse events were reported. Among the 72 patients, the median 
OS was 8.9 months, 12-month OS rate was 31.9%, with median PFS of 5.6 months, 
ORR of 33.3%, and DCR of 90.3%. Higher PD-L1 expression, without liver 
metastases were associated with higher ORR, however these factors could not 
effectively distinguish responders and non-responders. Importantly, dendritic 
cells - T helper cells - cytotoxic T lymphocytes (DC-Th-CTL) enriched immune 
niche and their spatial interactions were dominant predictors of response based 
on TIME analysis using a cyclic multiplex tissue staining assay, with an area 
under the curve value of 0.8. Overall, GnP plus toripalimab exhibited good 
safety and differentiated efficacy in selected population, and the spatial 
interactions of DC-Th-CTL represent promising predictors to efficacy of 
immunochemotherapy in locally advanced or metastatic PDAC.

BACKGROUND: The optimal resection for pancreatic neck cancer is challenging in 
clinical practice because we could dissect by pancreaticoduodenectomy or distal 
pancreatectomy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of 
lymph node dissection and to help determine the optimal surgical treatment for 
pancreatic neck cancer.
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 462 patients with pancreatic cancer who 
underwent curative-intent pancreatectomy between 2012 and 2022, 35 of whom had 
pancreatic neck cancer without preoperative radiologic gastroduodenal artery 
contact. We analyzed the clinicopathological characteristics, lymph node 
metastasis stations, and the efficacy index of lymph node dissection, which was 
calculated by multiplying the frequency of lymph node metastasis to each station 
by the 5-year survival rate of patients with positive lymph nodes at each 
station.
RESULTS: The lymph node station with the greatest rate of metastasis was #11p 
(28.6%), followed by #8 (17.1%), #14 (14.3%), #13 (14.3%), #17 (9.5%), and #6 
(4.8%). The efficacy indices of lymph node dissection were 14.3 for #11, 4.76 
for #13, and 8.57 for #14. There were no significant differences in 5-year 
recurrence-free survival and 5-year overall survival between patients undergoing 
pancreaticoduodenectomy and those undergoing distal pancreatectomy (23.7% vs 
54.7%, P = .142; 29.9% vs 51.1%, P = .179, respectively). Univariate survival 
analysis showed that tumor size ≥2 cm was associated with poor prognosis (hazard 
ratio, 3.842, P = .009).
CONCLUSIONS: PD with #11p lymph node dissection is preferable to DP in terms of 
survival benefit for pancreatic neck cancer with lymph node metastasis.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a poor prognosis. Due to a lack of 
clear symptoms, patients often present with advanced disease, with limited 
clinical intervention options. The high mortality rate of PDAC is, however, also 
a result of several other factors that include a high degree of heterogeneity 
and treatment resistant cellular phenotypes. Molecular subtypes of PDAC have 
been identified that are thought to represent cellular phenotypes at the tissue 
level. The epigenetic landscape is an important factor that dictates these 
subtypes. Permissive epigenetic landscapes serve as drivers of molecular 
heterogeneity and cellular plasticity in developing crypts as well as 
metaplastic lesions. Drawing parallels with other cancers, we hypothesize that 
epigenetic permissiveness is a potential driver of cellular plasticity in PDAC. 
In this review will explore the epigenetic alterations that underlie PDAC cell 
states and relate them to cellular plasticity from other contexts. In doing so, 
we aim to highlight epigenomic drivers of PDAC heterogeneity and plasticity and, 
with that, offer some insight to guide pre-clinical research.

Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most challenging malignancies to treat due 
to its late-stage diagnosis, aggressive progression, and high resistance to 
existing therapies. This review examines the latest advancements in early 
detection, and therapeutic strategies, with a focus on emerging biomarkers, 
tumor microenvironment (TME) modulation, and the integration of artificial 
intelligence (AI) in data analysis. We highlight promising biomarkers, including 
microRNAs (miRNAs) and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), that offer enhanced 
sensitivity and specificity for early-stage diagnosis when combined with 
multi-omics panels. A detailed analysis of the TME reveals how components such 
as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), immune cells, and the extracellular 
matrix (ECM) contribute to therapy resistance by creating immunosuppressive 
barriers. We also discuss therapeutic interventions that target these TME 
components, aiming to improve drug delivery and overcome immune evasion. 
Furthermore, AI-driven analyses are explored for their potential to interpret 
complex multi-omics data, enabling personalized treatment strategies and 
real-time monitoring of treatment response. We conclude by identifying key areas 
for future research, including the clinical validation of biomarkers, regulatory 
frameworks for AI applications, and equitable access to innovative therapies. 
This comprehensive approach underscores the need for integrated, personalized 
strategies to improve outcomes in pancreatic cancer.

Harnessing the Engineered Probiotic-Nanosystem to Remodulate Tumor Extracellular 
Matrix and Regulate Tumor-Colonizing Bacteria for Improving Pancreatic Cancer 
Chemo-Immunotherapy.

Poor chemotherapy efficacy in pancreatic cancer is attributed to limited drug 
permeation caused by the dense extracellular matrix (ECM) and drug degradation 
induced by tumor-colonizing bacteria. Here, a tumor-targeting 
probiotic-nanosystem is elaborately designed to remodulate ECM and selectively 
regulate tumor-colonizing bacteria for improving chemo-immunotherapy against 
pancreatic cancer. Specifically, drug-loaded liposomes are conjugated with 
Clostridium Butyricum (CB) via matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2)-responsive 
peptide to construct a probiotic-nanosystem. Particularly, vactosertib (VAC, a 
transforming growth factor-β1 receptor inhibitor) is delivered by 
probiotic-nanosystem to silence the active pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) for 
inhibiting the development of ECM, resulting in a loosened ECM and providing a 
golden opportunity for the deep penetration of chemotherapy drugs and immune 
cells. Subsequently, gemcitabine (GEM) is efficiently delivered into the core of 
tumors via probiotic-nanosystem, achieving an enhanced chemotherapy efficacy. 
Noteworthily, CB can alleviate γ-proteobacteria-mediated GEM degradation through 
competitively reducing the contents of γ-proteobacteria and promoting the 
amounts of tumor-inhibiting bacteria, thereby significantly potentiating the 
therapeutic effect of GEM. The engineered probiotic-nanosystem can not only 
enhance the GEM-induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) of a pancreatic tumor to 
activate antitumor immune responses but also markedly increase the 
tumor-infiltration of effector immune cells to heighten tumoricidal immunity, 
offering a promising strategy for chemo-immunotherapy of pancreatic cancer.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal liver metastasis (CLM) is classified into technical and 
oncologic categories, with recommended treatments for each resectability 
category. However, the classification of recurrent CLM has not been established 
to date.
METHODS: This study evaluated patients with CLM who underwent initial liver 
resection between 2006 and 2020 and subsequently experienced liver recurrence. 
Long-term outcomes and prognostic factors associated with recurrent CLM were 
investigated.
RESULTS: From 949 patients who underwent an initial liver resection, the 
analysis included 392 patients with liver recurrence. Repeat liver resection was 
associated with a significantly longer prognosis than non-resection (5-year 
overall survival [OS] from initial liver resection: 66.3 % vs 27.2 %, p < 
0.0001). Multivariable analysis indicated the following independent prognostic 
factors: four or more recurrent tumors (p = 0.015), tumor 5 cm or larger in size 
(p = 0.004), and presence of extrahepatic diseases (p = 0.003). The patients 
were stratified into resectable, borderline resectable, and unresectable 
recurrent CLM groups based on these criteria. The prognosis varied significantly 
across the groups, with 5-year OS rates of 67.3 % for resectable recurrent CLM, 
30.8 % for borderline resectable recurrent CLM, and 2.6 % for unresectable 
recurrent CLM (p < 0.0001). Patients with borderline resectable recurrent CLM 
who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy after initial liver resection had a 
positive prognostic impact of preoperative chemotherapy (p = 0.049).
CONCLUSION: The significant independent predictors of recurrent CLM prognosis 
were four or more tumors, tumor size of 5 cm or larger, and the presence of 
extrahepatic diseases at recurrence. It is critical to onsider the current 
condition and tumor resectability at the time of recurrence, and tailored 
treatments could further improve recurrent CLM outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer (PC) is characterised by late diagnosis, tumour 
heterogeneity, and a peculiar immunosuppressive microenvironment, leading to 
poor clinical outcomes. Local ablative techniques have been proposed to treat 
unresectable PC patients, although their impact on activating the host immune 
system and overcoming resistance to immunotherapy remains elusive.
METHODS: We dissected the immune-modulatory abilities triggered by local 
ablation in mouse and human PC models and human specimens, integrating 
phenotypic and molecular technologies with functional assays.
RESULTS: Local ablation treatment performed in mice bearing orthotopic syngeneic 
PC tumours triggered tumour necrosis and a short-term inflammatory process 
characterised by the prompt increase of HMGB1 plasma levels, coupled with an 
enhanced amount of circulating and tumour infiltrating myeloid cells and 
increased MHCII expression in splenic myeloid antigen-presenting cells. Local 
ablation synergised with immunotherapy to restrict tumour progression and 
improved the survival of PC-bearing mice by evoking a T lymphocyte-dependent 
anti-tumour immune response. By integrating spatial transcriptomics with 
histological techniques, we pinpointed how combination therapy could reshape TME 
towards an anti-tumour milieu characterised by the preferential entrance and 
colocalization of activated T lymphocytes and myeloid cells endowed with antigen 
presentation features instead of T regulatory lymphocytes and CD206-expressing 
tumour-associated macrophages. In addition, treatment-dependent TME 
repolarization extended to neoplastic cells, promoting a shift from squamous to 
a more differentiated classical phenotype. Finally, we validated the immune 
regulatory properties induced by local ablation in PC patients and identified an 
association of the short-term treatment-dependent increase of neutrophils, NLR 
and HMGB1 with a longer time to progression.
CONCLUSION: Therefore, local ablation might overcome the current limitations of 
immunotherapy in PC.

Ferroptosis, a distinct form of regulated cell death, is characterized by 
iron-dependent lipid peroxide accumulation in cell membranes from dysregulated 
cellular iron homeostasis and compromised antioxidant defense mechanisms. 
Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) is crucial in the regulation of ferroptosis by 
controlling lipid peroxide accumulation. Recent research established the 
association of ferroptosis with several diseases, prompting investigation toward 
ferroptosis-targeted therapeutic approaches. However, there is a lack of sensor 
systems designed to evaluate ferroptosis modulation in intact cells. In this 
study, we developed a highly sensitive luciferase-based reporter system to study 
GPx4-mediated ferroptosis in cells. We constructed a novel vector flanking the 
GPx4 promoter driving luciferase gene expression, demonstrating 
ferroptosis-specific luciferase activity in transfected HEK293T cells. We 
established stable cells expressing the construct and optimized its suitability 
for high-throughput screening using well-established ferroptosis modulators. We 
identified eugenol, a phenolic compound, as a potent ferroptosis inhibitor using 
the developed reporter system. Eugenol demonstrated dose-dependent protection 
against ferroptosis-induced damage in pancreatic beta cells, as assessed by the 
expression of the key markers such as GPx4, SLC7A11, NRF2, and HO1. Further, we 
showed the regulation of iron levels and total iron-binding capacity of beta 
cells by eugenol in streptozotocin (STZ) -induced diabetic mice. Additionally, 
the diabetes-induced downregulation of GPx4 and antioxidant Nrf2 in pancreatic 
tissue was significantly mitigated by eugenol, as evidenced by both 
immunohistochemistry and gene expression analysis. This research validates the 
functionality of the ferroptosis sensor and offers an approach to develop 
antidiabetic therapy by targeting ferroptosis to protect beta-cell viability and 
function.

BACKGROUND: Patients with borderline resectable (BR) or locally advanced 
pancreatic cancer (LAPC) require complex management strategies. This study 
evaluated the prognostic significance of the perichemotherapy skeletal muscle 
index (SMI) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) in patients with BRPC or 
LAPC treated with FOLFIRINOX.
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 227 patients with BR or LAPC who received 
at least four cycles of chemotherapy between 2015 and 2020. We analysed 
chemotherapy response, changes in SMI (ΔSMI, %) on computed tomography (CT) and 
CA19-9 to determine their impact on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall 
survival (OS). After the early application of loco-regional treatments (LRT) 
within 3 months after completing four cycles of chemotherapy, the outcomes were 
compared between ΔSMI and CA19-9 subgroups.
RESULTS: Among 227 patients (median age, 60 years; 124 [54.6%] male) with 97 BR 
and 130 LAPC, 50.7% showed partial response (PR) to chemotherapy, 44.5% showed 
stable disease and 4.8% showed progressive disease (PD). Post-chemotherapy 
CA19-9 levels were normalized in 41.0% of patients. The high and low ΔSMI groups 
(based on the gender-specific cut-off of -8.6% for males and -2.9% for females) 
comprised 114 (50.2%) and 113 (49.8%) patients, respectively. The high ΔSMI 
group had poorer survival rates than the low ΔSMI group in both PFS (HR = 1.32, 
p = 0.05) and OS (HR = 1.74, p = 0.001). Multivariable analysis showed that ΔSMI 
(high vs. low; PFS, HR = 1.39, p = 0.03; OS, HR = 1.82, p < 0.001) and 
post-chemotherapy response (PD vs. PR/SD; PFS, HR = 18.69, p < 0.001; OS, 
HR = 6.19, p < 0.001) were independently associated with both PFS and OS. 
Additionally, the post-chemotherapy CA19-9 (≥ 37 vs. < 37; HR = 1.48, p = 0.01) 
was an independent predictor for PFS. Early application of LRT after 
chemotherapy significantly improved PFS and OS in both ΔSMI groups (all 
p < 0.05). However, it was not beneficial in the group with high ΔSMI and 
post-chemotherapy CA19-9 ≥ 37 (PFS, p = 0.39 and OS, p = 0.33).
CONCLUSIONS: Progressive sarcopenic deterioration after four cycles of 
chemotherapy was associated with poor survival outcomes in patients with BR or 
LAPC after FOLFIRINOX. We also investigated the optimal clinical setting for the 
early application LRTs using the ΔSMI and post-chemotherapy CA 19-9.

BACKGROUND: The feasibility and safety of laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy 
(LPD) in overweight patients is still controversial. This study was designed to 
analyze the impact of overweight on surgical outcomes in patients undergoing 
LPD.
METHODS: Data from patients who underwent LPD between January 2018 and July 2022 
were analyzed retrospectively. A 1:1 propensity score-matching (PSM) analysis 
was performed to minimize bias between groups.
RESULTS: A total of 432 patients were enrolled, with a normal weight group 
(n = 241) and an overweight group (n = 191). After matching, 144 patients were 
enrolled in each group. The results showed that the incidence of clinically 
relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (CR-POPF) and delayed gastric emptying 
(DGE) was significantly higher in the overweight group compared to the normal 
weight group (P = 0.036). However, there were no significant differences in 
perioperative mortality (1.4% vs. 2.1%, P = 0.652) and long-term survival 
outcomes between malignancy patients with different body mass index (BMI) before 
and after PSM (all P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: It is safe and feasible for overweight patients to undergo LPD with 
mortality and long-term survival outcomes comparable to the normal weight group. 
High-quality prospective randomized controlled trials are still needed.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most poorly prognostic 
digestive tract malignancies. CLDN18.2 CAR-T therapy has recently shown 
promising clinical effects in PDAC. Radiotherapy, a traditional treatment, can 
induce systemic immune activation and abscopal effects. However, the synergistic 
effect and mechanism of their combination in PDAC treatment remain poorly 
understood. In this study, we developed a CLDN18.2-specific CAR-T and applied it 
to unilateral and bilateral mouse tumor models. Our results demonstrated that 
this synergy therapy not only improved tumor-killing effects in unilateral 
tumor-bearing mice but also induced regression in both local and distant tumors 
in bilateral tumor models. Mechanistically, early radiation-induced apoptosis 
promoted the proliferation of CD8 + T cells, while increased chemokine CCL2 
levels from localized and distant tumor sites facilitated CAR-T and endogenous T 
cell infiltration, leading to systemic tumor suppression. This study proposes a 
promising approach for treating metastatic pancreatic cancer by combining 
radiotherapy and CAR-T therapy, elucidating the mechanism of CAR-T cell-enhanced 
radiotherapy effects ex vivo, and highlighting a novel strategy for combating 
metastatic pancreatic cancer.

A highly aggressive neoplastic disease, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) 
is documented as the third chief cause of cancer-associated mortality in both 
sexes combined in the United States. For decades, gemcitabine-based chemotherapy 
has been embraced as a cornerstone drug for the treatment of PDAC. However, 
there have been several unsolved problems, including cytotoxicity, and 
chemoresistance. Gemcitabine efficacy was attributed to the attenuation of 
ribonucleotide reductase subunit-M1 (RRM1). Overexpression of RRM1 in PDAC is 
highly correlated with gemcitabine resistance and reduced gemcitabine 
sensitivity, resulting in a poor survival rate even after gemcitabine treatment. 
Moreover, the status of TP53, a tumor suppressor gene, assumes a decisive role 
in the response of PDAC to gemcitabine. Therefore, targeting RRM1 and P53 might 
be a therapeutic strategy for strengthening gemcitabine efficacy and 
cytotoxicity against PDAC. Alpinumisoflavone (AIF) is a prenylated isoflavone 
originated in Cudrania tricuspidate with versatile bioactive properties, 
including anticancer activity. However, there was no report whether AIF can 
exert anticancer effect and exhibit synergistic effect with gemcitabine against 
PDAC. Therefore, the anticancer properties of AIF were assessed with PANC-1 and 
MIA PaCa-2. In addition, synergism between AIF and gemcitabine were analyzed. 
Moreover, the contribution of P53 and RRM1 expression to gemcitabine resistance 
was assessed by comparing their protein levels in PDAC cells and normal 
pancreatic cells. The interactions of AIF with RRM1 protein were confirmed by 
molecular docking and dynamics simulation. Therefore, AIF enhances gemcitabine 
efficacy against PDAC through the regulation of P53 and RRM1.

BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced-stage pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) 
are regularly treated with FOLFIRINOX, a chemotherapy regimen based on 
5-fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin, which is associated with high 
toxicity. Dosing of FOLFIRINOX is based on body surface area, risking under- or 
overdosing caused by altered pharmacokinetics due to interindividual differences 
in body composition. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between 
body composition and treatment toxicity in advanced stage PDAC patients treated 
with FOLFIRINOX.
METHODS: Data from patients treated at the Maastricht University Medical Centre+ 
between 2012-2020 were collected retrospectively (n=65). Skeletal muscle-, 
visceral adipose tissue, subcutaneous adipose tissue-, (SM-Index, VAT-Index, 
SAT-Index resp.) and Skeletal Muscle Radiation Attenuation (SM-RA) were 
calculated after segmentation of computed tomography (CT) images at the third 
lumbar level using a validated deep learning method. Lean body mass (LBM) was 
estimated using SM-Index. Toxicities were scored and grade 3-4 adverse events 
were considered dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs).
RESULTS: Sixty-seven DLTs were reported during the median follow-up of 51.4 
(95%CI 39.2 - 63.7) weeks. Patients who experienced at least one DLT had 
significantly higher dose intensity per LBM for all separate cytotoxics of 
FOLFIRINOX. Independent prognostic factors for the number of DLTs per cycle 
were: sarcopenia (β=0.292; 95%CI 0.013 - 0.065; p=0.013), SM-Index change (% per 
30 days, β=-0.045; 95%CI -0.079 - -0.011; p=0.011), VAT-Index change (% per 30 
days, β=-0.006; 95%CI -0.012 - 0.000; p=0.040) between diagnosis and the first 
follow-up CT scan, and cumulative relative dose intensity >80% (β=-0.315; 95% CI 
-0.543 - -0.087; p=0.008).
CONCLUSION: Sarcopenia and early muscle and fat wasting during FOLFIRINOX 
treatment were associated with treatment-related toxicity, warranting 
exploration of body composition guided personalized dosing of chemotherapeutics 
to limit DLTs.

Chromosomal Instability (CIN) encompasses approximately 65 %-70 % of colorectal 
cancer (CRC) patients, playing a pivotal role in tumor progression. However, 
controversies persist regarding the molecular characteristics and treatment 
strategies associated with these patients. Integrative colorectal cancer 
proteogenomic analysis identified DDX18 in colorectal cancer. We investigated 
the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of colorectal cancer by the 
R-loop binding protein DDX18 using colon cancer tissues, cell lines and 
patient-derived organoids. Our findings revealed that DDX18 expression 
positively correlates with the expression of genomic instability marker R-loops. 
Moreover, heightened DDX18 expression delays the completion of DNA damage 
repair, leading to an increase in double-strand DNA breaks, thereby promoting 
genomic instability. Notably, the upregulation of DDX18 enhances sensitivity to 
DNA-damaging. This study elucidated DDX18 beyond participating in fundamental 
physiological functions, may play a crucial role in the regulation of genomic 
stability, and also provides a powerful resource for further functional 
exploration of DDX18 in cancer progression and therapeutic application.
